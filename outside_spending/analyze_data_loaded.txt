Notes on the new process...

-- count ies:

select count(*) from outside_spending_filing_rows, outside_spending_filing_header where outside_spending_filing_rows.parent_filing_id = outside_spending_filing_header.id and outside_spending_filing_header.form='F24';

select count(*) from outside_spending_filing_rows, outside_spending_filing_header where outside_spending_filing_rows.parent_filing_id = outside_spending_filing_header.id and outside_spending_filing_header.form='F24' and outside_spending_filing_header.is_amended;

--- narrative for switching to continuous loading:

load from archive with 

- enter_contribs_from_archive.py
- enter_spending_from_archive_2.py

* these are now superceded / combined into 
load_all_from_archive.py


--* need to make it ignore f24s that have already been entered. 

select count(*) from outside_spending_expenditure where filing_source = 'F24' and expenditure_date > date('4/1/2012') and superceded_by_amendment = False;
--> 
# gotta keep the superpac list up to date! 
python manage.py read_superpac_list

[ or python manage.py load_all_from_archive ]
python manage.py load_from_unprocessed_filings
python manage.py exclude_x_memo_fields
python manage.py check_old_F24_ies
python manage.py attach_models
python manage.py fix_office

python manage.py calculate_sums
python manage.py make_candidate_pacs
python manage.py make_race_aggregates
python manage.py make_candidate_aggregates
python manage.py make_state_aggregates
python manage.py make_presidential_state_pac_aggregates

-- for contribs: 

python manage.py attach_contribs
python manage.py set_contrib_flags


python manage.py set_update_time

--> still need ot periodically do ECs ; read superpac list; add new committees and candidates ; and log all of this. 

=== -- open questions -- unattached contribs. 

also: does it make sense to erase F3X's -- I think that means we have to reload them later, but.. 

== get list of all filing numbers: 
 mysql -uroot -p < dump_all_filing_numbers.sql  > filing_numbers.txt

===

ok rebasing all the code for load_all_from_archive

---> need to spit out unique file numbers
select distinct filing_number from outside_spending_contribution;
select distinct filing_number from outside_spending_expenditure;
select distinct filing_number from outside_spending_F3X_summary;
