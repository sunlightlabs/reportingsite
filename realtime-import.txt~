1007	Cram down look ups, cont.	cram-down-look-ups-cont	2	"More research (see here for <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/05/06/looking-up-cram-down-opponents-in-party-time/"">details</a> on what this research is. I'm trying to see if there was a flurry of fundraising around the <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/roll_call/show/5519"">vote</a> on the Durbin amendment to the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009.

<b>Sen. Thomas Carper</b>: Had a <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/party/6940/"">Jan. 28, 2009 fundraiser</a> for his birthday. He's not up for reelection until 2012, and has raised <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary2010.php?type=I&cid=N00012508&newMem=N"">$60,562</a> in the first quarter of 2009. 
<b>Sen. Saxby Chambliss</b>: A pair of fundraisers so far <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/party/8860/"">in 2009</a>, according to Party Time. One on <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/party/8860/"">March 18</a> was for the <a href=""http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00296640"">Republican Majority Fund</a>, Chambliss' leadership PAC. Chambliss doesn't face voters again until 2014; he's raised <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary2010.php?type=I&cid=N00002685&newMem=N"">$182,759</a> so far in 2009. 
<b>Sen. Tom Coburn</b>: No fundraisers in party time's database. Coburn, who is up for reelection in 2010, <a href=""http://newsok.com/tom-coburn-still-undecided-on-re-election-bid/article/3361407"">has yet to decide</a> if he's running. He's raised <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary2010.php?type=I&cid=N00005601&newMem=N"">$17,188</a>. 
<b>Sen. Thad Cochran</b>: One fundraiser in 2009, on <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/party/8820/"">April 19-20</a> (a golf outing for his leadership PAC, the <a href=""http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00202861"">Senate Victory Fund</a>).

<b>Sen. Susan Collins</b>: No fundraisers so far in 2009; Collins was reelected in 2008. She raised <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary2010.php?type=I&cid=N00000491&newMem=N"">$96,253</a> in the first quarter of 2009, according to Open Secrets.
<b>Sen. Bob Corker</b>: No fundraisers so far in 2009, at least not in Party Time (remember, it's not a complete list by any means). Corker will be up for reelection in 2012; he raised <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary2010.php?type=I&cid=N00027441&newMem=N"">$143,882</a> in the first quarter of 2009.
<b>Sen. John Cornyn</b>: No fundraisers so far in 2009, according to Party Time. Cornyn, who was reelected in 2008, has raised <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary2010.php?type=I&cid=N00024852&newMem=N"">$122,573</a> so far in 2009.

Here's a <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/00160.TIF"" title=""sample"">sample</a> of what we got in response to our FOIA -- a .tif or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_Image_File_Format"">tagged image file</a> format -- I picked one at random, but we have a CD-Rom with 189 files just like it.

Anu turned the files over to Scott Wells, our multi-talented office administrator, who used a program called <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/ocrad/ocrad.html"">ocrad</a> (it runs on <a href=""http://www.linux.org/"">Linux</a>) to convert it to a text file, which Anu posted <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2007/06/21/defense-correspondence-logs/"">here</a>.

Not perfect, but at least digitized and searchable. But still, somehow unsatisfying. I fooled around with the text file and was able to convert it to a tab delimited form (all those years coding agate at the Philadelphia Inquirer really came in handy).

Now, a few explanations. There are three sheets on the spreadsheet. Sheet one is the cleanest version of the data with some value added fields, sheet two has every field--the enhanced ones and the original ones, and sheet three has only the original fields from the text file. I ended up ignoring some fields (in part because DoD stopped sending them to us in response to subsequent requests, and in part because we've been unable to learn from DoD what those fields mean--the ones I didn't really touch were Agency, Task, Suspense and File Number). There's also a pair of columns called ""Extra One"" and ""Extra Two"" -- some of the data got bumped further to the right, but it was hard to tell which column to assign the extras to.

There's also some very messy data. For example, there's a lot of garble like this, WOULD LIKE7a REIOhR_REPID_R POSITION IN DOD,
and this OSD ""j2o5-07. The latter is from the OSD control number field, which one could use in a freedom of information request to more easily get a copy of the actual letter to which it refers. Those numbers are supposed to look like this: OSD 00136-07.

Now, to get this data into better shape, I need to go back to those .tif files, print them all out (there are 189 of them) and painstakingly go through them, comparing each page to the corresponding line in the spread sheet, fixing garble and double checking numbers, names and dates.

Now, the really ridiculous thing about all this is that the Office of the Secretary of Defense keeps its records in a form not dissimilar to the one that we've managed to put together here. To respond to our FOIA request, someone at DoD (probably a contractor) printed pages from a database, which they then turned into .tif files, which they then copied onto a CD-Rom, which they then sent to us. I'll have more to say about that aspect of this later."		2007-07-27 16:18:00	2007-07-27 21:51:58	2007-07-27 16:18:00	1	0	1

While this is still partially that, it's also turning into something else. As I noted, this is raw research, not a finished product--results to come. One thing I'm finding is that looking closely at slices of data from <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/"">Party Time</a> leads in all kinds of directions...

<b>Sen. Mike Crapo</b>: He's been <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Beneficiary/crapo/"">busy</a> in 2009, with six fundraisers, including two on the day of the vote (April 30) -- <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Beneficiary/crapo/"">breakfast</a> at the Hay Adams Hotel a few blocks from the White House, and <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/party/9618/"">cocktails and dinner</a> at Rosa Mexicano. The breakfast invited lists hosts, including <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lobbyist.php?lname=Auerbach%2C+Donald+C&id=U00000021860&year=2009"">Donald C.

Crapo's <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/party/10826/"">April 21st fundraiser</a>, which lists three hosts, is interesting as well. All the names turn up in the Open Secrets lobbying database, while two turn up in the revolving door databases -- <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lobbyist.php?year=2009&ype=l&lname=Hollier%2C+William&id=Y00000297150"">Will Hollier</a> (<a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=26356"">legislative director and later chief of staff</a> for Crapo), <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lobbyist.php?year=2009&ype=l&lname=Hollier%2C+William&id=Y00000297150"">Niels Holch</a> (a former <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=12443"">chief of staff</a> for Sen.

Both firms represent, among others, Native American tribes, and the invite lists Crapo's membership on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, and also noted that Sen. John Barrasso, ranking member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, would be in attendance. Crapo's next election is in 2010; he's raised <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary2010.php?type=I&cid=N00006267&newMem=N"">$191,965</a> in the first quarter of 2009.
<b>Sen. Jim DeMint</b>: <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Beneficiary/demint/"">17 fundraisers</a> in 2009, including two in February labeled as Financial Services Industry meet and greet and a Financial Services breakfast.

<b>Sen.

1027	Earmark request disclosures: do deadlines make a difference?	earmark-request-disclosures-do-deadlines-make-a-difference	2	"Adam Hughes of OMB Watch <a href=""http://www.ombwatch.org/node/9990"">asks</a> a trenchant question in response to a <a href=""http://www.rollcall.com/issues/54_130/news/34857-1.html"">report</a> by Jackie Kucinich in Roll Call. Kucinich notes that Rep. James Oberstar, chair of the House Transportation Committee, which will be overseeing the massive transportation reauthorization bill (the last one, as <a href=""http://www.taxpayer.net"">Taxpayers for Common Sense</a>'s Steve Ellis tells Roll Call, contained earmarks for the bridges to nowhere), will have less stringent earmark disclosure rules than the House Appropriations Committee. The latter, chaired by Rep. David Obey, requires members post their earmark requests online <b>before</b> they submit them to the committee. Oberstar, by contrast ""set a May 14 deadline for Members to submit requests and encouraged them to post the requests on their Web sites, but he stopped short of setting a mandatory deadline,"" according to Roll Call. The committee's communications director, Jim Bernard, told Roll Call ""We are not giving them a hard deadline [or stipulating] we won't consider them until they are posted. Our style is bit different than Mr. Obey's, but our results will be the same."" Hughes asks: <b>Sorry - quick follow-up Mr. Bernard. How exactly is not requiring earmark requests to be disclosed under the transportation reauthorization the same as requiring earmark requests to be disclosed in appropriations bills?</b>

Obviously it's not. So, on the evening of May 14, after 5 p.m. EST, Anu, Paul Blumenthal and I will start combing through member Web sites, looking for lists of requested earmarks for the transportation reauthorization bill. We'll tweet as we go along (hashtag: #wheremark), and see whether deadlines make a difference. When I looked for <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/04/06/links-to-house-earmark-disclosures-in-one-database/"">appropriations earmark requests</a>, I found earmark request disclosures or indications that members weren't requesting earmarks for 320 members). Let's see if we find as many without the deadline."		2009-05-13 16:26:36	2009-05-13 16:26:36	2009-05-13 16:26:36	1	0	1

<blockquote>General Motors Corp and Chrysler aim to drop as many as 3,000 U.S. dealers and are expected to begin sending notifications as early as Thursday, three people briefed on the still developing plans said.

GM, facing a U.S. government-imposed deadline of June 1 to restructure or file for bankruptcy, is expected to send termination notices to up to 2,000 dealers -- a third of its roughly 6,000 U.S. dealers, the sources told Reuters.

Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy on April 30, will also tell up to 1,000 of its 3,189 U.S. dealers it is terminating their franchise agreements, according to the sources who asked not to be identified because the controversial closure plans have not been yet announced.

The moves to shut down auto dealerships underscores how the economic pain caused by the downward spiral of both automakers -- now operating under U.S. government oversight -- is spreading beyond their home base in Detroit.

The development comes as dealer representatives have stepped up lobbying in Washington to try to slow down closures they estimate would cost 200,000 dealership jobs.</blockquote>

Of course, this will be for dealers and their employees. Others will suffer as well -- not like it's the most important example, but to give one: newspapers, local radio, television and cable (who are already hurting from a slow down in advertising) will lose ad revenue. Also worth noting that the reelection campaigns of members of Congress, as <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2008/12/04/financial-bailout-do-interests-of-automakers-and-members-diverge/"">noted here</a>, might suffer."		2009-05-13 22:47:44	2009-05-13 22:47:44	2009-05-13 22:47:44	1	0	1

The information on federal contracts awarded under the stimulus comes not from the recovery sites of individual agencies or from the Office of Management & Budget or <a href=""http://www.recovery.gov"">Recovery.gov</a>, but from a government Web site called <a href=""http://www.fedbizopps.gov"">FedBizOpps.gov</a>, which is used by federal procurement officers and private firms to track federal opportunities. The site currently lists 566 active and archived awards, which can be accessed through the <a href=""https://www.fbo.gov/?s=opportunity&tab=search&mode=list"">advanced search page</a> (to get the complete list, go to ""Documents To Search"" and choose ""Both,"" then to Opportunity/Procurement Type and select Award Notice, then scroll down to the bottom of the page, and under ""Recovery and Reinvestment Act Action,"" and click yes). 

FedBizOpps isn't the easiest site to maneuver in. The results page doesn't list the name of the contractor that got the award or the amount of money -- one has to drill down into each result to get those details. 

It is unclear when that information will be made available, in a more user friendly format, on Recovery.gov. That site's time line used to list May 20 as the date on which agencies were ""to begin reporting their competitive contracts and grants."" After we made inquiries to different agencies about exactly what information would be released on that date, it was removed from the time line.

That would seem to contradict point two from <a href=""http://porkbusters.org/2007/07/weak_tea_indeed_democratic_lea.php"">the list of objections</a> N.Z. Bear posted (""The new version removes the requirement for earmark lists posted online to be in searchable format"").

The bulk of earmarks are in committee reports, and these would be handled differently. The new bill says, starting on line 15 of page 70,
<blockquote>...If a committee reports a bill or joint resolution that includes congressionally directed spending items, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits in the bill or joint resolution, or in the committee report accompanying the bill or joint resolution, the committee shall as soon as practicable identify on a publicly accessible congressional website each such item through lists, charts, or other similar means, including the name of each Senator who submitted a request to the committee for each item so identified. Availability on the Internet of a committee report that contains the information described in this subparagraph shall satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph.

Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ²Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ²(c) <strong>To the extent technically feasible</strong>, information made available on publicly accessible congressional websites under paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be provided in a searchable format. (emphasis added)</blockquote>
Seems like the bulk of earmarks are in committee reports rather than in the text of legislation. So it appears that in this version of the bill, posting an unsearchable .pdf with a chart of earmarks could be considered to be enough (as Laura Peterson of Taxpayers for Common Sense <a href=""http://taxpayer.net/TCS/PressReleases/2007/06-08hasc.html"">once noted</a>, these can be presented in ""visual quality that would strain the eyes of Superman, much less daylight-deprived budget watchdogs""). I suppose it depends on what ""to the extent technically feasible"" means.

Just <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/transportationauthorizationearmarkrequests/gqxHHASs"">83 House members</a> disclosed their earmark requests for the upcoming transportation reauthorization bill (that last version, SAFETEA-LU, was loaded with Prairie Parkway and Bridge to Nowhere--both of which were earmarks) on the same day that they submitted them to the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee. 

Rep. James Oberstar, chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, didn't require members to disclose their earmark requests online in the same way that the House Appropriations Committee does. The latter requires members to post all their earmark requests online <i>before</i> they submit them to the committee for consideration -- at least 321 members met the deadline.  

Members had to submit their requests to Oberstar's committee on May 14, but, as <a href=""http://www.ombwatch.org/node/9990"">Adam Hughes explains</a>, Oberstar didn't issue a deadline for them to be disclosed to the public. Last night, my colleagues Paul Blumenthal, Avelino Maestas, Josh Ruihley and Nisha Thompson joined Anu and me in a search for members who disclosed their earmark requests to the public at the same time they gave them to the committee (you can see our tweeting <a href=""http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23wheremark"">here</a>). We clicked and scrolled and clicked and scrolled through 433 member sites, looking for disclosures. (We finished up around 11 p.m., and my thanks, by the way, to all who participated -- this project kind of defines scut work, and the gusto with which developers, outreachers, editors and writers attacked it was a pleasure to see. What a great group to be a part of.)

There's a database of the links to requests we found <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/transportationauthorizationearmarkrequests/gqxHHASs"">here</a>, and you download the same in an excel format <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/transportationauthorizationearmarkrequests/gqxHHASs"">here</a>.

Zack Space</a> and for <a href=""http://www.joewilson.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=402&Itemid=1"">Rep. Joe Wilson</a>. 

I guess we'll continue to update the database, at a much slower rate, throughout the week, but as with our <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/04/06/links-to-house-earmark-disclosures-in-one-database/"">previous efforts</a> in this area, I'd much rather be looking at <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/04/03/visclosky-shuts-out-former-pma-group-clients/"">actual earmark requests</a> than criticizing the process of posting them online. 

I note, for example, that Rep. Hal Rogers includes, among his <a href=""http://halrogers.house.gov/media/pdfs/SAFETEA-LU%20Reauthorization%20Website%20Disclosure%20051409.pdf"">earmark requests</a>, more than $83 million for I-66, a project that he's been supporting <a href=""http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071216/NEWS01/712160492"">for a while</a>:

<blockquote>SOMERSET, Ky. -- U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers has funneled nearly $90 million in federal funds toward a proposed interstate highway in Kentucky that likely will never cross the state, much less stretch beyond its borders.

Despite the substantial expenditure of funds, not a single shovelful of dirt has been turned on Interstate 66, conceived nearly two decades ago as a coast-to-coast corridor that would run through Southern Kentucky. Since then, it has been abandoned by every other state as unnecessary or too expensive.

""We try not to build roads that don't lead anywhere,"" said Brent Walker of the West Virginia Department of Transportation, which has never seriously pursued I-66.

Nevertheless, Kentucky continues to push forward, urged on by I-66 supporters, including local politicians and economic-development officials, and driven by Rogers' powerful influence as a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee.

That influence -- accumulated over the 27 years Rogers has represented Southern and Eastern Kentucky's 5th Congressional District -- combined with Congress' general reluctance to oppose a member's pet projects, helps explain I-66's staying power.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A private company was being paid $300 million by the federal government to clean up radioactive waste at two abandoned Cold War plants in Tennessee when an ironworker crashed through a rotted floor. That prompted a major safety review, which ended up forcing work to an abrupt halt, and the project was shut down for months. The delay and a host of other problems caused cost estimates to rise, eventually hitting $781 million.

Now, President Obama's stimulus package is opening a bountiful stream of new funding, and the same contractor, Bechtel Jacobs, is slated to get $118 million to help complete the job.

The Energy Department has begun releasing more than $6 billion in stimulus money to clean up 18 nuclear sites from New York to California, more than doubling the typical yearly funding for the program. Contractors helped shape the stimulus package and are lined up to get the work, including many that have been cited for serious safety violations and costly mistakes. </blockquote>

Interestingly, I can't find any Bechtel Jacobs awards when I search <a href=""http://www.fedbizopps.gov"">FedBizOpps.gov</a> and <a href=""http://www.usaspending.gov/fpds/fpds.php?busn_indctr=r&fiscal_year=2009&parent_id=121431&sortby=d&record_num=f500&detail=2&datype=T&reptype=r&database=fpds"">USASpending.gov</a> (the former, as I <a href=""a hef=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/05/14/where-to-find-stimulus-contracts/"">reported previously</a>, is currently the primary source for stimulus contract information, not <a href=""http://www.recovery.gov"">Recovery.gov</a>.

Richard Lugar:

<blockquote>WASHINGTON Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., has asked Congress to set aside $3.5 million to help Navistar develop a hybrid Humvee at the truck companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fort Wayne plant.

The request is one of 31 he submitted to the Appropriations Committee as it begins weighing the lawmakersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bids for pet projects in their states.

Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., has said he will not request money for projects he singles out. The process, often called ""earmarks,"" has come under increasing criticism as the number of requests has multiplied and as the federal deficit expanded. </blockquote>

Of course, he may not be the first, but again, to the best of my knowledge he's the first to have his disclosures noticed.

John Murtha, the defunct PMA Group which funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars of campaign contributions to Murtha from its PAC, employees and its clients, many of which were the beneficiaries of Murtha earmarks. Rood notes that these investigations are all distinct inquiries:

<blockquote>The federal probes do not appear to be directly connected or controlled by a single office, agency or prosecutor, but instead involve various combinations including the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the Defense Criminal Investigation Service, the Justice DepartmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Public Integrity Section, and the FBI.</blockquote>

Two ways to look at this: With so many investigators looking at so many different threads, the pressure must be mounting. On the other hand, with the inquiry spread over so many different agencies and without any central oversight, it sounds more likely that each investigation is looking at the periphery (PMA Group, the earmark recipients) rather than what links them (Murtha)."		2009-05-19 12:16:04	2009-05-19 12:16:04	2009-05-19 12:16:04	1	0	1

They posted image files that canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be cut and pasted, tables, single files with every item or dozens of files for each individual item. Still, 96 members of the Senate have, for the very first time, posted their earmark requests for appropriations bills onlineÃ¢â‚¬â€and you can find all the links to those disclosures <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/linkstosenatefy2010appropriationsrequests/mjrAXqhT"">here</a>.

Unlike the House, which has required members to disclose the name and address of the beneficiaries of all their earmarks since 2007, rules adopted when the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act was passed allowed senators to file a single disclosure certifying that neither they nor their immediate family members had a financial interest in any of their earmark recipientsÃ¢â‚¬â€without specifying who those recipients are. That changed in January 2009, when Sen. Daniel Inouye joined his House counterpart, Rep. David Obey, in requiring more stringent earmark disclosure. Senators now must post their requests on their Web sites before they can be considered by the Appropriations Committee. 

Last night, I pointed and clicked my way through 99 Senate Web sites (Minnesota still has one seat locked in a court battle) and collected all the <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/linkstosenatefy2010appropriationsrequests/mjrAXqhT"">links</a>.

I don't think Senate earmarks have ever gotten the same level of scrutiny that House earmarks have, in part because of the aforementioned lack of disclosure, and in part because the biggest ongoing earmark scandal, the PMA Group, is really a House scandal. While a few members have been singled out for bad earmarks (<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/19/AR2007121902645_pf.html"">Sen.

1077	You can't go far...	you-cant-go-far	2	"...without running into Chinese dominance in some form of production and Goldman Sachs. It's after midnight, so I'm researching (what else) some earmarks. I came across a company, Molycorp Minerals, that might get $3 million from taxpayers to develop metal separation techniques in the U.S. so that we're not dependent on the Chinese for magnetic ores. The taxpayer money ""will be leveraged against more than $20 million in private capital to accelerate the engineering and scale of this work."" 

Leveraged struck me as an odd word choice -- ""added"" would be more appropriate. In any case, I googled around for Molycorp, and found <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS181489+20-Apr-2009+MW20090420"">this press release</a>, courtesy of Reuters:

<blockquote>Molycorp is a Delaware limited liability company with headquarters in Greenwood Village, Colorado, and is a private, US mining and technology company that produces and markets rare earth products. Molycorp is primarily owned by Resource Capital Fund IV L.P., Pegasus Partners IV, LP, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and Traxys North America LLC. As the owner of one of the world's richest rare earth deposit outside of China and a leader in rare earth technology development, Molycorp's expertise has provided breakthroughs in industries as varied as military, computing and automotive. As the leading western supplier, Molycorp markets rare earth materials from its world class rare earth deposit and mining operation in Mountain Pass, California. In addition, Molycorp maintains a joint venture with Sumitomo Metals, called Sumikin Molycorp, which markets rare earth products in Asia and produces permanent magnet materials in Japan.</blockquote>

I was looking for a different connection in connection with Molycorp and didn't find it (I'm totally in fishing mode, so about 99.999999 percent of the stuff I'm looking at tonight is precisely what I am not looking for) but I thought it was interesting enough on its own merits that it warranted a post.

1091	Delving into Rep. Lewis' earmark requests	delving-into-rep-lewis-earmark-requests	2	"Ben Goad <a href=""http://www.pe.com/localnews/politics/stories/PE_News_Local_S_lewis25.46f636b.html"">reports</a> for the Press Enterprise that Rep. Jerry Lewis, former chair and now ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, earmarked $96 million for firms represented by Innovative Federal Strategies, which was once under federal investigation:

<blockquote>Inland Rep. Jerry Lewis is requesting more than $96 million in federal earmarks for clients of Washington lobbyists whose dealings with the veteran lawmaker were part of a criminal investigation launched three years ago.

Would-be recipients of the earmarks, including Inland cities, agencies, hospitals and defense contractors with local branches, paid more than $1.3 million to the firm -- more than a third of its total lobbying revenue, records show.

As the top Republican on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, Lewis, R-Redlands, is well positioned to influence spending bills. Despite the scrutiny and criticism of earmarks -- spending requests lawmakers insert into bills, often for projects in their districts -- Lewis remains unapologetic about his funding requests. </blockquote>

Last week, I started poking into the same earmark disclosure list, and put together a little database of the disclosures that's available <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/jerrylewisearmarkrequests/uInmnDpt"">here</a> -- I include links to the lobbying disclosures of those intended recipients that had hired K Street representatives. 

A few things that struck me: <b>1)</b> Lewis did the same thing back in 2007. Kevin Bogardus of The Hill <a href=""http://thehill.com/business--lobby/lobbying-firm-linked-to-rep.-lewis-booms-despite-federal-investigation-2007-08-15.html"">reported</a> in August 2007 -- that was before the federal investigation of Innovative Federal Strategies <a href=""http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/004093.php#more"">seemed to unravel</a> -- that Lewis sponsored or co-sponsored earmarks in the defense appropriations bill worth $55 million for clients of Innovative Federal Strategies for fiscal year 2008. So the FY2010 requests are par for the course. Compare that to, say, Rep. Peter Visclosky, under investigation for his ties to PMA Group, who didn't request <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/04/03/visclosky-shuts-out-former-pma-group-clients/"">any earmarks</a> for the firm's former clients according to his disclosures. <b>2)</b> When I ran the contribution numbers for 2010 (just the first quarter numbers) from Innovative Federal Strategies' clients to Lewis, they weren't particularly robust: from <a href=""http://fec.gov/DisclosureSearch/HSRefreshContributorList.do?election_yr=2010&contComeFrom=candList&cand_id=H8CA37079&contCategory=INDIVIDUAL&category=searchCand&searchKeyword=LEWIS"">individuals</a>, $4,600 from a pair of ESRI executives; from <a href=""http://fec.gov/DisclosureSearch/HSRefreshContributorList.do?election_yr=2010&contComeFrom=candList&cand_id=H8CA37079&contCategory=PAC&category=searchCand&searchKeyword=LEWIS"">PACs</a>, nothing. I ran the numbers for the 2008 cycle as well using CRP's open, coded data (I didn't run cities and towns and I only ran FY2010 earmark request beneficiaries, which excluded prior earmark recipients and contributors like SAIC and General Atomics), and came up with $34,600 from employees, family members and PACs of Innovative Federal Strategies to Lewis' campaign and leadership PAC--nothing to sneeze at, but not exactly on a par with campaign money from PMA Group and its clients. Visclosky, for example, took in $369,750 in the 2008 election cycle, according to our fine friends at the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/news/PMA_and_Clients_to_111th.xls"">Center for Responsive Politics</a>. On the other hand, Visclosky took in <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/04/16/hill-no-campaign-cash-for-visclosky-from-former-pma-group-clients/"">nothing</a> from former PMA Group clients in the first quarter of 2010. <b>3)</b> I counted 32 requests for clients of Innovative Federal Strategies, and overall there were 61 requests asking for more than $166 million for recipients--towns, universities, municipal water authorities, defense contractors, Indian tribes--that had hired lobbyists. Jim Specht, Lewis' spokesman, told me that the ""vast majority"" of groups that ask them for earmarks have hired a lobbyist. He said he couldn't speak to why this was the case. This still strikes me as the biggest question about earmarks. Lawmakers defend earmarks by arguing that they know their districts -- do they, or do they know lobbyists who know their districts? Lewis also requested 28 earmarks potentially worth more than $51 million for entities that </i>haven't</i> hired a lobbyist. <b>4)</b> It's so much more interesting to start delving into these lists than it is to go hunting for them all hours of the night in the dark recesses of congressional Web sites. 

Some questions off the observations: <b>1)</b> How many members have a similar ratio (2/3s of requests go to recipients represented by lobbyists)? Is it the norm? Or a deviation, the result of Lewis' position on the Appropriations Committee? <b>2)</b> These are <i>requests</i> for earmarks, not funded, signed-sealed-and-delivered earmarks. So what does the final percentage end up looking like? And what about the money split? Does it remain at roughly $1 in earmarked money for those who don't hire lobbyists vs. $3.25 in earmarked money for those that do? <b>3)</b> Would following this and tracking these percentages potentially say more about the efficacy of lobbyists, who spend part of their time trying to persuade members of Congress that the priorities of their clients are higher than those of everyone else?"		2009-05-26 21:27:01	2009-05-26 21:27:01	2009-05-26 21:27:01	1	0	1
1093	Open Secrets of 100 Days, 100 Projects	open-secrets-of-100-days-100-projects	2	"Hm. The Obama Administration released a <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/100-days.pdf"">new report</a> on Recovery spending, 100 Days, 100 Projects. ""As we worked to compile the Report, all of us were struck by the very personal stories that we came across. We learned that Recovery is about more than just projects. Itâ€™s about helping people who have been hit hard by the worst recession of our lifetimes,"" the <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/100-Days-100-Projects/"">blog post</a> announcing the work states. 

Curious, I started scrolling through. It's loaded with tidbits like this:

<blockquote>Jobs & Job Training: 15. The president of New Hampshire paving company Continental Paving estimates he would have had to lay off 75 employees if it werenâ€™t for the Recovery Act. â€œContinental Paving, Mark Charbonneauâ€™s family-run business, landed a $10 million contract to reconstruct and pave a section of the F.E. Everett Turnpike in Bedford, as part of a larger project to connect the highway with Manchester-Boston Regional Airport. Continentalâ€™s contract came out of a $130 million package of stimulus money targeted to build and repair highways and bridges in New Hampshireâ€¦..â€ [<a href=""http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090510/NEWS02/305109921/-1/XML15"">The Nashua Telegraph</a>, 5/10/09]</blockquote>

I looked up Mark Charbonneau and Continental Paving in OpenSecrets.org. Charbonneau contributed $35,825 to federal campaign committees (to both Democrats and Republicans), while the company's self-identified employees gave $61,150 since 1989. 

Here's another:

<blockquote>14. The owner of a New York construction company was able to rehire laid-off seasonal employees after it won contracts for Recovery-Act-funded projects. â€œSlate Hill Constructors Inc. laid off 40 seasonal construction workers last year, and the company spent the winter in intense competition for the summerâ€™s road and bridge projects. â€¦ By the end of April, company President Jeff Hanlon was weighing whether he would have to skip raises for the first time in 24 years. No more. â€¦.Slate Hill won a $733,831 contract to repair 50 culverts that could have collapsed and washed out Route 54A in Steuben County. â€¦ Slate Hill has also won a $6.4 million contract to rehab nine arches on a 450-foot stone bridge in St. Lawrence County..â€ [<a href=""http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2009/05/stimulus_money_puts_new_york_c.html"">The Post-Standard, 5/20/09</blockquote>]

Looking up ""Hanlon, Jeff"" in Open Secrets, we find $5,250 in donations, including $1,000 to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on March 6, 2009. 

I'm certainly not saying that $1,000 or $61,000 in campaign contributions spread over 20 years necessarily assures one of much of anything other than invitations to more fundraisers, but it's worth taking a closer look at the rest of the report."		2009-05-27 23:26:55	2009-05-27 23:26:55	2009-05-27 23:26:55	1	0	1

From the aforementioned <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/100-days.pdf"">100 Days, 100 Projects</a> report:

<blockquote>The New York State Veteranâ€™s Home at St. Albanâ€™s, in Jamaica, New York, is using $109.5 million in Recovery Act spending to install more efficient motors, variable speed drive units, lighting, ballasts, lighting sensors, daylight sensors and to replace incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs. All of these improve the energy efficiency of the facility, lower costs, and lessen its impact on the environment. </blockquote>

Just curious -- let's say the improvements cut the facility's power bills by half. How many years will it take for those savings to equal the cost of the $109.5 million spent to achieve those reductions?

Incidentally, these things look vaguely like earmarks to me (<i>You sure it's not a case of when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail?-ed.</i> Hey, we've got dollars, we've got recipients, we've got project descriptions -- all we're missing is addresses!)."		2009-05-28 01:51:17	2009-05-28 01:51:17	2009-05-28 01:51:17	1	0	1

110	Office of Administration not subject to FOIA	110	3	"According to this <a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20387828/"">AP article</a>, the Justice Department is maintaining that the White House Office of Administration is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act.

The argument for this seems to be that the OA is not an Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºagencyÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ as defined by FOIA. But in the past year, the Office of Administration has processed 65 FOIA requests, as AP reports.

Right now I'm looking to see if I can find any of these projects listed on Recovery.gov, the agency Recovery Web pages, FedBizOpps.gov, USASpending.gov, and other places. Not sure I'll do this for all 100 projects.  

In the mean time, it's well worth looking at this <a href=""http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/05/stimulus-overhy.html"">post</a> from Jake Tapper, which probably explains <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/05/28/how-much-stimulus-money-does-it-take-to-screw-in-a-compact-fluorescent-light-bulb/"">this</a> as well -- the dollar figures in the report don't necessarily have any relationship to the projects being described. After quoting a description of a project that's listed as spending $27 million to upgrade Regency House in D.C., Tapper writes:

<blockquote>In reality, the work done on the Regency House that was funded by the stimulus package amounted to $59,000 in parts and labor, according to Dena Michaelson, director of public affairs for the Washington DC Housing Authority.

The $27 million is the total amount given by the stimulus act to the Washington DC Housing Authority, the vast majority of which hasn't been spent.

In addition, though the White House's ""100 Days, 100 Projects"" entry for the Regency House work lists ""solar panels, a 'green' roof, a rainwater collection system, energy-efficient lighting as well as water conserving toilets, showerheads, and faucets"" as what was done as ""part of the upgrade,"" the only parts funded by the stimulus were the solar panels, at a cost of $45,000, and the rainwater collection system, at a cost of $14,000.

The response of the White House to questions about the claim in the book evoked a critique of journalists.

Liz Oxhorn, Recovery Act Press Secretary, said in a statement that the Regency House work is ""one of thousands of targeted investments weâ€™re making nationwide to jumpstart new and ongoing energy efficiency renovations to public housing units and we only wish the same amount of time and energy that has gone into dissecting the structure of three sentences had gone into exploring the billions of dollars in new job-creating projects like this one now underway thanks to the Recovery Act.â€</blockquote>

Hey, we'd love to explore the billions of dollars in new job-creating projects -- just give us the data!

1111	Investment Ratings Tank for Home Loan Banks	investment-ratings-tank-for-home-loan-banks	2	"<img src=""http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/images/blog/category/sf_subsidies.png"" class=""alignleft"">They hold $1.3 trillion in assets and, chances are, you've never heard of them.

<a href=""http://www.fhlb-of.com/"">The Federal Home Loan Banks</a>, or FHLBs, were created during the Depression, and are meant to ensure that if the economy were to tank, commercial banks would still have the money to issue home loans.Â  A cooperative of 12 regional banks, the system works like this: banks, thrifts, credit unions and insurers (more than 8,100 across the country) become members and put up collateral; the FHLBs borrow money and lend it to them at a discount.

<img src=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/fhlbs-houses1.jpg"" alt=""fhlbs-houses1"" title=""fhlbs-houses1"" width=""240"" height=""178"" class=""alignleft"" />So where does the subsidy come in?Â  Well, there's an implicit guarantee that if the home loan bank system were to fail, the government would bail it out, as it bailed out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last year.Â  Because investors believe this, the FHLBs are able to borrow money at very low rates -- and therein lies the subsidy.

The FHLBs provide a valuable service, especially to community banks that can't easily borrow money elsewhere.Â  But on May 18, their regulator, <a href=""http://www.fhfa.gov/"">the Federal Housing Finance Agency</a>, had <a href=""http://www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/2331/FHFAReportToCongress2008final.pdf"">harsh words</a> for some of the FHLBs.Â  Hereâ€™s what it had to say about the Seattle bank:
<blockquote>â€œGovernance is unsatisfactoryâ€¦ [The bankâ€™s] financial condition is weakeningâ€¦ Earnings probably will not be sufficient to cover additional [losses] should [they] occur. Future losses could be substantial, and the FHLBank has no retained earnings with which to buffer additional losses.â€</blockquote>

The problem is that over the last few years, some of the FHLBs invested heavily in private mortgage-backed securities -- the same types of investments that lost much of their value during the housing crisis.Â  The FHLBs <a href=""http://www.fhlbtopeka.com/resources/Related/1112-FHLBs_Continue_to_Prosper_Amid_Housing_Market_Turmoil_9_23_08.pdf#page=2"">invested in very few securities</a> backed by subprime loans -- the so-called toxic assets we've heard so much about of late.Â  Nonetheless, the values of some of the FHLB investments have plunged -- and fast.

In the space of just two months, for example, the ratings of about $1.4 billion of the Seattle bank's investments <a href=""http://subsidyscope.com/projects/bailout/fhlb/#graphic1"">were downgraded from AAA to junk status</a>.Â  That doesn't mean they're now worthless, but it certainly increases the chances that they won't recover their full value.Â  Whatâ€™s more, the Seattle bank was only holding about $1.7 billion in capital on December 31, 2008; that capital is meant to protect it against losses.

The Seattle bank appears to be in the worst shape, but several of the FHLBs have run into similar problems, as <a href=""http://subsidyscope.com/projects/bailout/fhlb/"">we detailed earlier this week at Subsidyscope.com</a>.

[caption id=""attachment_1147"" align=""alignleft"" width=""410"" caption=""The 12 Federal Home Loan Banks, and the regions they cover""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-1147"" title=""fhlb_system_map1"" src=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/fhlb_system_map1.jpg"" alt=""The 12 Federal Home Loan Banks, and the regions they cover"" width=""410"" height=""285"" class=""aligncenter"" />[/caption]

In May, when they released their <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=federal+home+loan+bank&amp;match=contains&amp;CIK=&amp;filenum=&amp;State=&amp;SIC=&amp;owner=include&amp;action=getcompany"">first quarter numbers</a>, several of the FHLBs took substantial â€œunrealized losses,â€ largely because of the private mortgage-backed securities.Â  Because the banks believe these losses are temporary, they don't have to be recognized on their accounting statements.

The unrealized losses were quite large in some cases.Â  The Seattle bank <a href=""http://subsidyscope.com/projects/bailout/fhlb/#graphic2"">had far more unrealized losses than it had capital</a>, which could raise problems if some of them are realized in the future.

And the Seattle FHLB has already exhausted many of the buffers it had to protect against future shortfalls.Â  For example, at the end of 2008, it became the first Federal Home Loan Bank in the systemâ€™s history to run out of retained earnings, an important safeguard against losses.

Home loan bank representatives say the setbacks are merely temporary because they intend to hold the securities to maturity.Â  By then, they predict, the economy will have improved and these holdings will have recovered their value.

Besides, spokespeople say, the FHLB system as a whole has enough capital to recover from any future losses, even if a few of the banks were to come up short.

In an e-mail, a spokesperson for the Seattle bank said the downgraded securities are ""still performing,"" and that the unrealized losses are ""driven by depressed market prices, rather than actual economics.""  

Still, some analysts have concerns.Â  ""[T]he kind of numbers you're talking about would suggest a significant amount of stress,"" said Mark Flannery, professor of finance at the University of Florida, Gainesville, and co-author of the 2006 report, <a href=""http://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/erq306_frame.pdf"">""The Federal Home Loan Bank System: The ""Other"" Housing GSE.""</a> 

<a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/pen-ink1.jpg""><img src=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/pen-ink1.jpg"" alt=""pen-ink1"" title=""pen-ink1"" width=""160"" height=""240"" class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-1175"" /></a>Granted, the home loan banks' other assets are much stronger than their mortgage-backed securities.Â  The majority of FHLB assets -- about 70 percent -- are made up of advances, or loans to member banks.Â  Those advances are extremely secure for investors; in fact, in their 77-year history, the home loan banks have never lost a penny on an advance.

Private mortgage-backed securities are much riskier, however.Â  In January, Moody's was already raising concerns about the FHLBs' capital levels, based on data from October 2008.Â  It reported that in the worst-case scenario, if the FHLBs' securities didn't regain their value, eight of the 12 banks would fail to meet their capital requirements, raising risks for taxpayers.  Further complicating the picture, the Financial Accounting Standards Board loosened the accounting rules that govern the home loan banks.  In the case of the Seattle bank, the net income on its books as of March 31 would have been <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1329701/000119312509115859/d10q.htm#tx96202_4"">$823 million lower</a> without the rule change.

Regardless, Timothy Yeager, a professor of finance at the University of Arkansas and a former economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, thinks the home loan banks will remain strong.Â  ""They have the means to straighten this out, and in the end, they'll be fine,"" he said.Â  ""They'll get their capital levels back over time.""

But some charge that a few of the FHLBs have endangered their mission to make homeownership affordable by making such risky investments.Â  ""The Federal Home Loan Banks received so many benefits from government that one would have expected them to manage their affairs more prudently,"" said Tom Stanton, fellow at the Center for the Study of American Government at Johns Hopkins University and a specialist in government-sponsored enterprises like the FHLBs.  ""Given their low cost of funds and the agency debt markets, they didn't need to take on risky assets in order to thrive and carry out their public purposes.""

Rahm Emanuel in support of projects at the ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:placename w:st=""on"">Memorial</st1:placename>  <st1:placetype w:st=""on"">Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> in Chicago and the Illinois Institute of technology.   <o:p></o:p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We recently received the <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/April-July.pdf"">correspondence logs from DOE</a> and there were at least 15 similar letters. Although none of these seem to have actually secured the funding, we have found that writing in support of a specific project is not unique to just one lawmaker or only to the DOE either. For instance <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/epa-correspondence-log.xls"" title=""epa-correspondence-log.xls"">EPA's correspondence </a>list several organizations that have received backing from various lawmakers.</p>
Other than letters asking for funding this set of DOE logs also list letters written by Rep. Henry Waxman, where he asks DOE to preserve any communications received from the White House officials using Republican National Committee or other nongovernmental e-mail accounts.<o:p> </o:p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Another letter from Rep. Brad Miller, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºrequests information from the DOE regarding whether any similar meetings of employees occurred at which results of the past elections or political strategies for future elections were discussed...Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹</p>

118	Congressional Subpoena Watch	congressional-subpoena-watch	2	"The Washington Post <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/18/AR2007091801790.html"">reports</a> that 13 members of the House of Representatives have received subpoenas in connection with the trial of <a href=""http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Brent_Wilkes"">Brent Wilkes</a>,  one of the contractors alleged to be involved in the <a href=""http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Randy_%22Duke%22_Cunningham"">Randy ""Duke"" Cunningham</a> bribery case:
<blockquote>The defense contractor charged with bribing convicted former congressman Randy ""Duke"" Cunningham has subpoenaed 13 House members, including former speaker J. Dennis Hastert, to testify in his federal trial.

But the 13 lawmakers are refusing the subpoena, and the House general counsel sent lawyers for the contractor, Brent R. Wilkes, a letter saying that it was overly broad and ""did not elaborate as to what testimony you seek from each member.""

Wilkes has been indicted on more than 30 counts, including fraud and money laundering, as one of several alleged conspirators who paid more than $2.4 million in bribes to the California Republican. Cunningham is serving an eight-year prison term after pleading guilty to steering millions of dollars in government business to Wilkes and other defense contractors.

It is unclear what Wilkes's defense team wants from Hastert (R-Ill.) and the other lawmakers. His attorney, Mark J. Geragos, did not respond to repeated requests for comment yesterday.</blockquote>
The article goes on to note ""As required by House rules, the subpoenas were read into the Congressional Record late Monday evening,"" which I think is inaccurate--it's not the text of the subpoena, but rather notification that the member has been served with a subpoena, that <a href=""http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=House_Rule_VIII_-_Response_to_subpoenas"">House Rules</a> call for.

I ran a quick search on <a href=""http://www.lousdb.org"">LOUIS</a> in the 2007 Congressional Record for Subpoena, and pulled all the notifications. They appear in chronological order (the Wilkes 13, in <strong>bold</strong>, are at the end of the list). Seems like this should be something we could devise a widget to search for. Here's the list...

This sentence particularly jumps out:

<blockquote>After reviewing your request carefully, we have determined that your request as presently written, since it would appear to apply to all 535 Members of Congress, is much too broad to enable this Office to conduct an adequate' and effective search for responsive records. As a result, I have determined that the records that you seek are not reasonably described.</blockquote>

Now, I would think that anywhere from one to six computer searches would be sufficient, depending on how DoD keeps track of its correspondence. If they get a letter from Rep. Bob Forehead, do they log it as Rep. Bob Forehead, Reperesentative Bob Forehead, Congressman Bob Forehead, or Hon. Bob Forehead? Do they log in letters from Sen. Joseph Harrison Paine as coming from Sen. Joseph Harrison Paine, Senator Joseph Harrison Paine, Congressman Joseph Harrison Paine, or Hon. Joseph Harrison Paine? And do they also maintain a field for the organization for which the correspondent works, as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission does (see <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/congressional.pdf"">attached</a>). 

Obviously, we won't take DoD's denial as the final word here."		2007-03-28 14:54:26	2007-03-28 14:54:26	2007-03-28 14:54:26	1	0	1

First, as we all should know, getting a subpoena, even in connection with your official work duties, does not indicate that you (or your boss, in the case of staffers) did anything wrong; all it means for sure is that someone thinks you have relevant information in a legal proceeding and wants to compel your testimony.

<blockquote>SUBPOENAS WITHDRAWN. Subpoenas of a dozen House members were withdrawn late Tuesday by an attorney for a defense contractor accused of bribing former Rep. Randy (Duke) Cunningham, R-Calif., after a federal judge indicated he was prepared to quash them, the Associated Press reported. U.S. District Judge Larry Burns said he might consider enforcing the subpoenas if contractor Brent Wilkes' attorneys could demonstrate the lawmakers had specific information related to the charges and that their testimony would be critical to his defense. Wilkes was scheduled to go on trial today in San Diego on charges that he gave Cunningham more than $700,000 in cash and perks. Wilkes' attorney, Mark Geragos, told reporters he might file new requests for subpoenas against former Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and California Republican Reps. John Doolittle, Duncan Hunter, Darrell Issa and Jerry Lewis. Geragos also said he was trying to serve a subpoena on White House Chief of Staff Bolten; the White House had no comment. </blockquote>

John Murtha but certainly involves his brother Kit (a retired <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lobbyist.php?year=2006&ype=l&lname=Murtha%2C+Kit&id=Y00000348170"">lobbyist</a>) and his former <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?year=2008&lname=KSA+Consulting&id="">lobbying firm</a>, five different companies doing business, directly or indirectly, with Defense (including one under federal indictment and one that allegedly wanted to outsource earmarked defense work to ""China or someplace""), an earmark from the pre-disclosure era, some technical corrections added to the Tsunami relief bill that moved the funds for that earmark from one recipient to another (because the original recipient allegedly wanted to do the work in ""China or someplace"" rather than in Murtha's district), about $8.2 million of taxpayer money, and a whole lot of digging. Oh, and PMA Group makes a cameo appearance. Read the <a href=""http://www.rollcall.com/issues/54_139/news/35448-1.html"">whole thing</a>, but also consider this:

When reporters asked Murtha about Kuchera Systems, a company in Murtha's district for whom Murtha has earmarked defense funds and which has now been <a href=""http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h5X3nzQKNbT4FtKd99CEveeygIcgD98G1I6G0"">temporarily suspended</a> by the Navy from contracting due to ""allegations of fraud,"" the appropriator responded: ""What's that got to do with me? What do you think, I'm supposed to oversee these companies? That's not my job. That's the Defense Department's job."" Compare that to what Singer found:

<blockquote>Murtha had secured several earmarks for the company in previous years, and in 2001, he announced that AEPTEC would be an initial supporter of a nonprofit Murtha was creating called the Pennsylvania Association for Individuals With Disabilities.

But something went awry in Murthaâ€™s relationship with AEPTEC.

Murtha spokesman Matt Mazonkey said â€œthe only recollection we have is that there was an import/export issue that had involved AEPTEC, and when this was brought to light, they disappeared as a company.â€

At the time, Murtha was the ranking member on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, which he now chairs.

AEPTEC never moved into the new building, instead holing up with a handful of staff at an existing office park down the road. ...

... Kit Murtha told Roll Call that his memory of AEPTEC is fuzzy, but â€œI did know that there was some kind of thing happening about work going out of the country rather than staying here. It seems to me that somehow, some way they were taking money and then ... they were taking the work to China or someplace.â€

Kit Murtha said, â€œI canâ€™t speak for Jack, and I canâ€™t speak for anybody else, but that certainly would have pissed Jack off.â€</blockquote>"		2009-06-03 16:17:10	2009-06-03 16:17:10	2009-06-03 16:17:10	1	0	1
122	(Federal) Help Wanted	federal-help-wanted	2	"Via the invaluable blog devoted to developments in federal government ethics, the <a href=""http://www.iecjournal.org/iec/2007/10/onlinetraining-.html"">IEC Journal</a>, I came across <a href=""http://www.usoge.gov/pages/comp_web_trng/comp_web_trng_pg2.html#ogewrkctr_07"">this Web course</a> for federal workers on the issues raised by working with government contractors:
<blockquote>Increasingly, private sector contractor employees are being used to accomplish the business of Government. This trend shows no signs of slowing down. These contractor employees can work either off-site or even in the same location as you. This may sometimes cause certain ethical issues to arise which you'll need to think about.

It is important for you to know about the ethics rules and principles that focus on the specific situations that are likely to come up when Government and contractor employees work closely together. Some of these rules will be familiar to you, especially if you have taken ethics training before in your agency. Some may not be so familiar.</blockquote>
And it goes on from <a href=""http://www.usoge.gov/pages/comp_web_trng/cwt_modules/ogewrkctr_wbt_07/a2.html"">there</a>, describing different situations that might arise from having two people doing the people's business, one of whom works for the people and the other who works for a private contractor.

I thought about that when I came across <a href=""https://cp-its-rmprd.saic.com/main/careerportal/Job_Profile.cfm?/3BZEOC3C9KHZ2UL91EI2G1ZB2VNCDXWBLY7DX4W0GYX4G700U26XQBF47HHBVO0ABIETTR1XSMEX6DSX6FLGR13HWZLRJNN4U2JHARNF8NLHR13G4MUDE3J5TSS20QAY51CWW0Z3GXT9CUIDMV6MI7R17PM7R17R5N"">help wanted ad</a> while doing some unrelated research on this <a href=""http://www.earmarkwatch.org/earmark/41537/"">$2 million earmark</a> to SAIC for something called a ""Command and Control Mission Manager (C2MM) Spiral 5."" Here's the job description to which I've added a link:
<blockquote>JOB DESCRIPTION: Analyst on shift working as a member of a government-contractor team within the Fusion Branch of the <a href=""http://www.inscom.army.mil/"">INSCOM Intelligence Operations Center</a> (IOC). Primary focus is providing support to INSCOM and its customers. Perform sensor-performance monitoring, life cycle management and delegated tasks (i.e. geographic area and threat-collection assessments). Integrate all-source intelligence with data gleaned from UGS to develop UGS deployment options, conduct trend analysis, and produce analytical products for dissemination. Perform tasks associated with support to UGS supporting ground forces in general regardless of geographic area of operations. Communicate sensor performance status to leadership as well as vendor for supporting priority actions. Draft sensor contributory highlights to demonstrate theater ISR integration. Maintain current draft of Theater, CJTF, and INSCOM PIRs and/or ONS as related to QRC support (UGS, WSS). Draft daily summaries; perform website updates, reports and trend analysis to support operations. Provide in-depth intelligence analysis in support of a wide variety of Army and Joint operations. This position will require shift work and periodic overtime in support of 24/7 operations.</blockquote>

INSCOM is <a href=""http://www.inscom.army.mil/mission.asp"">a major Army command</a> that ""conducts dominant intelligence, security and information operations for military commanders and national decision makers."" It's a government intelligence agency, in other words, doing government work to be used by others in the government. It's not exactly clear to me why this wouldn't be a government job, why the military would be hiring a ""private sector contractor employee"" to ""accomplish the business of Government,"" but, as the ethics course above notes, it is an increasingly common phenomenon, one that has yet to be fully studied. For example, is it cheaper to have a government employee or an employee of SAIC do the job?"		2007-10-03 20:46:16	2007-10-03 20:46:16	2007-10-03 20:46:16	1	0	1

Hoyerâ€™s move follows eight attempts by Republican anti-earmark crusader Rep. Jeff Flake (Ariz.) to jump-start a probe â€” and aims to pre-empt Flakeâ€™s ninth stab at the issue, which was due for a vote on Thursday. It marks a sharp break from Democratic leadersâ€™ previous approach to the burgeoning controversy involving the now-defunct lobbying firm, which amounted to them trying to keep their ranks in line opposing the Flake resolutions.</blockquote>

1231	PMA Group probe: What did the House vote for?	pma-group-probe-what-did-the-house-vote-for	2	"Roll Call's Tory Newmyer and Jennifer Yachnin are both good reporters, and their story is certainly easy to read, but I'm still sitting here scratching my head trying to figure out exactly what it is that the House just voted for in the matter of PMA Group, the lobbying firm at the heart of a series of federal investigations involving campaign contributions to members of Congress and earmarks to some of the firms clients:

<blockquote>The Democratsâ€™ resolution, offered by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (Md.) with the backing of leadership, would give the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct 45 days to report on whether it is probing PMAâ€™s dealings with the lawmakers. The measure passed 270-134, with 28 Republicans crossing the aisle to support it.

But GOP leaders argued that because lawmakers, on a party-line voice vote, decided to refer the measure to the ethics committee, the panel would need to approve it and then refer it back to the full House for approval before it would take effect. â€œThis is a joke,â€ said Michael Steel, spokesman for House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio). â€œIt is the tiniest speck of political cover from a Democratic leadership that has voted time after time to block a real investigation of PMA.â€

Democratic aides countered that while the Republican critique is technically correct, the ethics panel would act on the resolution in the given time frame because a majority of the chamber â€” in voting for the resolution â€” had effectively called for such a move.</blockquote>

How's that for resolute action? Mark Twain <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/03/26/congressional-ethics-committees-whats-past-is-prolog/"">would have been proud</a>."		2009-06-04 03:47:39	2009-06-04 03:47:39	2009-06-04 03:47:39	1	0	1
1234	Rep. Flake: Campaign contributions are a financial interest in an earmark	rep-flake-campaign-contributions-are-a-financial-interest-in-an-earmark	2	"Rep. Jeff Flake has released a letter asking the Ethics Committee asking it to ""specifically prohibit members from being able to certify having no financial interest in an earmark when they have received campaign contributions from the entity that would benefit from the earmark or those affiliated with it."" 

Essentially, Flake is asking the committee to hold that, for earmarks, campaign contributions create a conflict of interest in the same way that, say, being part owner of a company would create a conflict of interest: The more flush the company is with federal contracts gotten through earmarks, the better off its (presumably greater number of) employees would be, and thus would have more donors with more money to contribute to the member's campaign. 

Putting on a policy hat for a moment, in some ways <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=hr110-6"">H.Res. 6</a>, which required members to declare that neither they nor their spouses had a financial interest in the recipients to whom they were directing earmarked funds, opened the door to this. Congressional ethics rules (such as they are) deal with conflicts of interest not through prohibitions but through transparency. Thus, a member like Rep. Marion Berry of Arkansas can vote to increase <a href=""http://cfra.blogspot.com/2006/07/rep-marion-berrys-farm-subsidy.html"">the farm subsidies</a> that he receives. It's up to voters in his district to determine whether that's a conflict of interest. Regulation of campaign contributions works the same way -- and, as <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/02/19/pma-investigation-looking-for-more-than-straw-men/"">previously noted</a> on Real Time, the Justice Department even assumes ""they are almost always given and received with a generalized expectation of currying favor with the candidate benefitting therefrom."" 

While members will most likely ignore it, Flake's letter raises some very interesting issues in how Congress deals with ethics regulations: is it better to prohibit behaviors, or make them transparent and trust to voters to decide the ethical boundaries. His letter also reminds me of how much in the dark we still are with so much of Congress. After all, with earmarks, we are talking a minute sliver of the federal budget. Why not bring the same standards of disclosure and accountability to the rest of government spending?"		2009-06-04 16:45:06	2009-06-04 16:45:06	2009-06-04 16:45:06	1	0	1

The rest of the members of the subcommittee have netted collectively $180,000Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®an average of about $12,800 per memberÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®from the beneficiaries of their earmarks.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 16pt"">While Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., the committeeÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s chairman, Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., and Rep. Pete Visclosky, D-Ind., directed the bulk of their earmarks to companies whose employees and political action committees donated to their campaigns, their colleagues on the 17-member Defense Appropriations subcommittee requested earmarks for companies that, for the most part, contributed little or nothing to their campaigns, according to an analysis of earmark data provided by <a href=""http://www.taxpayer.net/"">Taxpayers for Common Sense</a> and an analysis campaign contribution data from the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/"">Center for Responsive Politics</a> and the <a href=""http://www.fec.gov/"">Federal Election Commission</a>.</p>

Moran was second in receiving contributions from beneficiaries of his earmarks, taking in $99,000. But when it came to sponsoring earmarks, Moran barely cracked the top ten, scoring some $41 million worth of earmarks.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 16pt"">By contrast, Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., who was the fifth most profligate defense earmarker, received just $6,000 from employees of two of the 12 companies that benefited from the $44 million in federal appropriations he directed. Rep. Nancy Kaptur, D-Ohio earmarked $44 million to 18 recipients and three of these companies have contributed, to date, $4,500 to her campaign committee. Kaptur's contributions came from the University Hospitals of Cleveland, the Parametric Technology Corporation -- a multi-national consulting company that provides software solutions to the Navy -- and a much smaller company, Ares Inc., based in Port Clinton, Ohio.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 16pt"">Rep.

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 16pt"">Most of the companies whose employees and PACs contribute to the campaigns of members who sponsor earmarks for them are relatively small players in the defense industry, which giants like Lockheed Martin ($32 billion in federal contracts in 2006) and Boeing ($21 billion the same year) dominate.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 16pt"">Three Northern Virginia companies have received defense earmarks worth $2 million each from Moran and have given liberally to his campaign or his leadership PAC, the Virginia Leadership PAC, in 2007Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®Prologic Inc., Planning Systems Inc. (PSI) and Progeny Systems Corporation. Yet Progeny Systems and Prologic both receive ""innovation research"" grants and contracts from the Small Business Administration; in 2006, Prologic's annual revenue was $40 millionÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®by contrast, Lockheed MartinÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s was $39.6 billion.

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 16pt"">In 2006, employees of Prologic Inc., Planning Systems Inc. and Progeny Systems Corporation gave a total of $74,900 to Moran; in the first six months of 2007 theyÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ve contributed $29,400. Employees of Prologic and Planning Systems donated almost $20,000 on June 8, 2007, according to FEC records. On that date, the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee held hearings on the 2008 spending bill. Meanwhile, all<strong> </strong>of Progeny's contributions to Moran came on March 18 Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¬ three days after the initial deadline for members to submit all<strong> </strong>earmark requests.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 16pt"">PrologicÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s $2 million earmark from Moran was for the Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºMEDSTARS Integration with Global Combat Support SystemÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ program which is managed by the Air Force. This is part of an ongoing project for which Prologic is custom designing a computer program that documents and assesses patient injury, details of the particular incident and the medical treatment.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 16pt"">According to the company's Web site, Prologic Inc. provides information technology solutions to many government agencies including the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and NASA. The company received six earmarks in the House version of the Defense Appropriations Bill worth $13 million, and has made campaign contributions this year to others on the defense appropriations subcommittee, including both Murtha and Visclosky.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 16pt"">Murtha directed several earmarks to medical research organizations, some of which are non-profits, in his district. But the funds he is pumping into medical research programs appear to address health problems that affect the general population, and are not related to illnesses and injuries that have higher incidences in military service.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 16pt"">One of Murtha's biggest earmarks, for $15 million, went to the Windber Research Institute as part of the Military Molecular Medicine Initiative (M3I).

1260	Campaign Software Makers All About Disclosure, Except their Own	campaign-software-makers-all-about-disclosure-except-their-own	27	"<p>NGP Software, a leading provider of software for electronically disclosing campaign contributions to the Federal Election Commission, is striving to keep its long-running legal battle with a competitor, Aristotle International, under wraps. In August 2005, plaintiff Aristotle filed suit against NGP alleging unfair business practices, claiming that the firm falsely advertised as serving only Democrats while selling an identical product at a heavy discount to political action committees that supported Republicans.</p>
<p>Aristotle International and NGP have nearly exclusive control of a market that appeared virtually overnight when the FEC introduced electronic filing requirements in 2001. The companies write and sell software that manages records ofâ€”and takes a cut ofâ€”nearly all campaign donations, which amounted to more than $1 billion in the 2008 election cycle. The software costs tens of thousands of dollars per copy.</p>
<p>In testimony in the suit, NGP Software, which bills itself â€œthe leading provider of fundraising and compliance software for Democratic campaignsâ€ on its Web site, acknowledged a hidden partnership with Capital Advantage under which NGP's software was re-branded and sold to PACs that, in the 2006 cycle, gave more to Republicans than they did to Republicans. NGP has for years scored points with Democratic congressional offices by advertising that it worked â€œsolely with Democrats and their allies.â€ Aristotle casts itself as a nonpartisan technology provider.</p>
<p>When a reporter tried to obtain a copy of the partnership agreement with Capital Advantage last Octoberâ€”which like many records in the case was sealed to the publicâ€”NGP said she might be an agent of Aristotle. Aristotle had, in fact, helped the freelance reporter, Alison Gregor, prepare the legal paperwork, and has also launched an aggressive public relations campaign aimed at convincing Democrats to demand a refund and switch to Aristotle. The suit seeks all profits made by NGP by selling to Democrats.</p>
<p>Aristotle, founded in 1983, stressed its nonpartisan credentials as a provider of software for campaignsâ€”it boasts that the 1992 presidential campaigns of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot all used its software. The company dominated the market for filing software when the FEC first mandated that House and presidential campaigns and political action committees disclose their contributions electronically, but it has lost a tremendous amount of business to NGP in recent years.</p>
<p>NGP was paid $5.6 million in the 2008 election cycle by PACs and House and presidential candidates, compared to $2.8 million paid to Aristotle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. (The amount paid by Senate candidates is unknown because they do not file electronically.) Some 169 Democratic members of the House used NGP, while 147 members used Aristotleâ€”all but 35 of them Republicans.
Expenditure reports filed with the FEC show that Capital Advantage (now owned by the parent company of newspaper Roll Call) was paid $146,000 for helping groups that, at the time the suit was filed, were far more generous to Republicans than Democrats, raise money. A Web site paid for by Aristotle, <a href=""http://www.notrobinhood.com"">NotRobinHood.com</a>, lists Republicans who have received money from those PACs, implying that Democrats who use NGP software are unwittingly supporting their political opponents.</p>
<p>But Capital Advantage has never worked directly for a Republican candidate, and while it did raise money for the RNC, the PACs it raised money for in 2008 gave slightly more money to Democrats than they did Republicans. Corporate PACs tend to support incumbents, and, with some exceptions of course, the party in control of Congress generally gets more support from them.</p>
<p>Aristotle says in court filings that NGPâ€™s fierce determination to keep the agreement secret proves its significance. NGP says they're not concerned with the truth coming out so much as they are with what Aristotle would do to ""misrepresent"" the facts.</p>
<p>The rival companies demanded every piece of information they could get out of each other, fishing for damaging information in discovery while agreeing to keep the information sealed from the public. NGP and Aristotle both sought at times to limit disclosure, sealing even deliberations about what should be kept hidden.</p>
<p>By contrast, the heated competition between the firms is no secret in Washington circles.</p>
<p>NGPâ€™s CEO, Nathaniel Pearlman, served as Chief Technology Officer for Hillary Clintonâ€™s 2008 presidential campaign, for which he was paid about $1 million. He began his career at Aristotle, but left to start his own company because he couldnâ€™t stand the thought of helping Republicans, he told the Wall Street Journal in 2006.</p>
<p>In court filings, NGP downplayed Pearlmanâ€™s partisanship, arguing instead that Aristotle, whose revenues had actually increased from $8 million to $14 million during the period of NGPâ€™s alleged misconduct, couldnâ€™t prove it was harmed. Even if customers switched, NGP argued, it was because NGP offered a better product, not because of its ideology.</p>
<p>â€œThatâ€™s almost like a person who kills his parents and then claims heâ€™s an orphan,â€ a lawyer for Aristotle, Robert Bredhoff, told the trial judge. â€œTheir ads emphasize over and over that â€˜people choose us because weâ€™re partisan.â€™â€</p>
<p>Secrecyâ€”and alleged secrecyâ€”is as much an issue in the trial as partisanship. â€œYou used the statement several times that they have a secret, concealed relationship with CapAd,â€ the judge, Thomas Hogan, asked Bredhoff. â€œYou get that from where?â€</p>
<p>â€œThis is not known to the general public,â€ argued Bredhoff. â€œThe reason they donâ€™t want it out there is because it completely contradicts their message, which they promulgate constantly. It was not known to anybody until this litigation began, and itâ€™s been agreed by the parties in the course of this litigation that that fact remain secret.â€</p>
<p>â€œThereâ€™s an awful lot under seal in this case,â€ Hogan said of the battle between two firms that make money in part from the FEC electronic disclosure business. â€œI think we may eventually have to look.â€</p>"		2009-06-17 16:26:21	2009-06-17 16:26:21	2009-06-17 16:26:21	1	0	1
127	Congressional Oversight of Blackwater Hampered by Lack of Documents	congressional-oversight-of-blackwater-hampered-by-lack-of-documents	3	"Nine months before Blackwater <st1:country-region w:st=""on"">USA</st1:country-region> employees took part in a shootout in which eight Iraqi civilians were killed, a few members of Congress raised concerns about the performance of the private military company that provides security services for the Departments of State and Defense in <st1:country-region w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>. In 2007, five members of Congress sent at least six letters to the Pentagon and Foggy Bottom raising questions about the company, raising questions about the controversial firm. <o:p></o:p>

One member who requested information to bring some oversight and accountability to the Blackwater found that neither the State Department nor the Defense Department complied with his request for documents.<o:p></o:p>

On Jan. 29, 2007, Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/cohen-letter.pdf"" title=""cohen-letter.pdf"">wrote</a> to the Secretary of Defense asking for all documents relating to Blackwater contracts. Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºThe Congressman read news articles about BlackwaterÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s various missions for U.S. government agencies overseas which prompted him to contact the Defense Department,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ Brian Alberts, a spokesman for Cohen, wrote via e-mail. Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºWe also sent an identical letter to the State Department on the same day, but they never responded.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹<o:p></o:p>

In the weeks preceding CohenÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s inquiry, Blackwater was involved in a number of incidents that received press coverage; the most widely reported involved a Christmas Eve shooting by a Blackwater employee of an Iraqi security officer and a mid-January crash of a Blackwater helicopter. Blackwater was also in the news for other issues, including getting a contract to train military personnel in <st1:country-region w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Sudan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<o:p></o:p>

Alberts was uncertain which story prompted CohenÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s inquiry.<o:p></o:p>

Other members of Congress appear to have been prompted to seek information on Blackwater on behalf of constituents concerned about the company, logs of correspondence between members of Congress and the Defense Department show.

Our Freedom of Information Act requests for the letters themselves are still pending; CohenÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s office emailed us a Word document containing the text of his letter.<o:p></o:p>

<strong>Three Months Later</strong><o:p></o:p>

The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/dod-cohen-response.pdf"" title=""dod-cohen-response.pdf"">replied to Cohen's letter</a> on April 24 -- long after the Feb. 5 deadline Cohen set in his letter -- and provided a list of Blackwater contracts, but none of the actual contract documents that Cohen had requested. That list was not comprehensive, but included only contracts administered by the OSD.<o:p></o:p>

In its reply, OSD also informed Cohen that his letter was being treated as a FOIA request, which seems to be the accepted procedure for all requests even from Members of Congress. According to <a href=""http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_V_1/page3.htm"">these</a> Department of Justice guidelines, if a congressional request for oversight information from does not come from a committee or subcommittee chairman, it is to be treated as a regular FOIA request. As journalists can well attest, that means that very often membersÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ offices need to wait months before receiving any documents.<o:p></o:p>

OSDÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s response to Cohen further suggested that for the actual contract documents, the representativeÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s office would have to send out FOIA requests to agencies within Defense -- the Army, Navy, Air Force, Defense Logistics Agency and the U.S. Special Operations Command, for example -- directly. Alberts told us that CohenÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s office is planning on sending out FOIA requests to these departments for further information but has yet to do so.<o:p></o:p>

As for the State Department, CohenÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s office has taken no action since sending out its initial request for information on Blackwater.<o:p></o:p>

The limited information that CohenÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s office received shows that Blackwater does far more than provide bodyguards in <st1:country-region w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The list of contracts includes ones for education services in <st1:state w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Hawaii</st1:place></st1:state> for the Navy, leases of airplanes from Blackwater-subsidiary Presidential Airways, and contracts for Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºTraining/curriculum developmentÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ given to Blackwater Target Systems LLC, another subsidiary, by the Navy.<o:p></o:p>

Since 2000, Blackwater <st1:country-region w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">USA</st1:place></st1:country-region> has received more than $1 billion in contracts and more than $800 million of this comes from the State department. Only $47 million of their contracts have been awarded with full and open competitive bidding, according to data from <a href=""http://www.fedspending.org/fpds/fpds.php?fiscal_year=&amp;company_name=BLACKWATER+USA&amp;sortby=r&amp;datype=T&amp;reptype=r&amp;database=fpds&amp;detail=-1&amp;submit=GO"">fedspending.org</a>.<o:p></o:p>

<strong>Constituent Claims about Blackwater<o:p></o:p></strong>

The other five letters were directed to the assistant secretary of Defense for legislative affairs; letters directed to this office are generally inquiries from constituents forwarded by members of Congress, according to Dave Martinez, a DoD Freedom of Information official. The subject of one such letter, sent in January to DoD from the office of Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., was Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºAbout Blackwater USA Contracts,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ according the correspondence log.<o:p></o:p>

Two other letters from constituents, forwarded to DoD by the office of Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., in April have intriguing, if harsh, subject lines reading, Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºBlackwater is running around with military weapons doing military things they should be held accountable just like the agencyÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ and Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºStop Erik Price the founder of BlackwaterÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹<o:p></o:p>

The subject of a May letter sent by the office of Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W. Va., was Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºConcern regarding the actions of Lieutenant General Gary North in response to an attack by Blackwater USA,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ most likely a reference to court martial proceedings held for two Air Force personnel who had an altercation with a Blackwater employee. All charges against the men were ultimately dropped; Lieutenant General Gary North was head of Central Command of the Air Force during the case.<o:p></o:p>

The office of Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., sent a letter in May from a constituent Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºConcerned about tax dollars paying to fund private militia Blackwater,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ according to the DoD correspondence log. Although KohlÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s office did not release the letter, they confirmed that it was from a constituent asking DoD to release information on Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºwhat services the federal government has paid Blackwater for and the amounts of the contracts,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ Joe Bonfiglio, KohlÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s press secretary said.<o:p></o:p>"		2007-10-16 18:56:14	2007-10-16 20:14:31	2007-10-16 18:56:14	1	0	1
1271	Is FOIA any better under Obama? An anecdote today, data later	is-foia-any-better-under-obama-an-anecdote-today-data-later	3	"Newsweek's Michael Isikoff <a href=""http://www.newsweek.com/id/202875"">report</a> on the Obama administration's mixed record on transparency got me to thinking about our own experience with FOIA requests. Isikoff notes,
<blockquote>As a senator, Barack Obama denounced the Bush administration for holding ""secret energy meetings"" with oil executives at the White House. But last week public-interest groups were dismayed when his own administration rejected a Freedom of Information Act request for Secret Service logs showing the identities of coal executives who had visited the White House to discuss Obama's ""clean coal"" policies. One reason: the disclosure of such records might impinge on privileged ""presidential communications."" The refusal, approved by White House counsel Greg Craig's office, is the latest in a series of cases in which Obama officials have opted against public disclosure.</blockquote>
Anu is our FOIA maven and is going to audit our FOIA log to see whether there's been any improvement in response times since Obama issued a <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Freedom_of_Information_Act/"">memorandum</a> stating, in part, ""All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure, in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA, and to usher in a new era of open Government. The presumption of disclosure should be applied to all decisions involving FOIA.""

Don't take my word for it, but my guess is that we won't see much improvement.

While we wait for Anu to crunch the numbers, I thought an anecdote might be useful. Back in March 2007, I FOIAed the Office of Naval Research for information on a <a href=""http://www.usaspending.gov/fpds/fpds.php?reptype=r&amp;detail=-1&amp;sortby=f&amp;datype=T&amp;reptype=r&amp;database=fpds&amp;database=fpds&amp;parent_id=58899&amp;fiscal_year=2006&amp;record_num=f500"">contract</a> it awarded to a company called Mobilvox. Mobilvox <a href=""http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2007/01/08/small-business-hires-big-lobbyists/"">was of interest</a> for several reasons: they'd hired a bunch of different lobbyists -- the now defunct PMA Group, KSA Consulting (which employed Rep. John Murtha's brother), Chambers &amp; Associates (whose name partner worked for Randy ""Duke"" Cunningham), and GSP Consulting, a Pittsburgh-based firm that includes a former Murtha staffer. They'd gotten earmarks from both Murtha and Rep. James Moran, and they maintained offices in both districts.

When I FOIAed the Office of Naval Research, I asked for a copy of the above linked contract, any correspondence with ONR regarding the contract (including letters, emails, faxes, etc.), any forms SF-LLL (see <a href=""http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2007/02/02/looking-into-lobbying-federal-contracts-and/"">here</a> for an explanation of what that is). I won't bore you with the details of my dealings with the two different private contractors that handle FOIA requests for ONR, or the multiple contacts I've gotten asking (perhaps hoping against hope) that I was no longer interested in seeing my FOIA request fulfilled.

In January 2008, I received some of the pages of the contract (no correspondence yet). Missing were five pages that included the description of work to be performed and pricing information -- I learned last week that ONR ""is still in the process of working with the submitter regarding redacting these pages"" -- a full six months after I got part of the contract and fifteen months after I filed my initial FOIA request.

Waiting for FOIA requests was always like watching paint dry--it still is. Third party contractors still do a lot of the work of responding to FOIA requests and private entities mentioned in FOIA requests can review information requested and argue against its disclosure. It's a slow, cumbersome process encrusted with all sorts of different rules. A ""presumption to disclosure"" doesn't by itself fix anything."		2009-06-23 21:01:11	2009-06-23 21:01:11	2009-06-23 21:01:11	1	0	1

1298	The FOIA Process: Still as Archaic as Snail Mail	the-foia-process-still-as-archaic-as-snail-mail-2	3	"<p class=""MsoNormal"">There are very few occasions in the Sunlight offices for us to use the fax machine, so we were somewhat out of practice when we learned that we had to use it to send Freedom of Information Act requests to the Department of Treasury. At least the fax is instantaneous: we received most of our responses from them via snail mail.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">To do <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/04/10/who%E2%80%99s-manning-the-tarp-desk/"">this story,</a> which involved looking into various agencies in charge of the bailout of the financial sector, we had to file seven FOIA requests--all sent via fax to Treasury--then make several phone calls to follow up on our request. We had to justify our request for a fee waiver in some calls, but most were devoted to patiently, politely cajoling FOIA officers to expedite our requests. It took us more than three months from the time the first FOIA was sent out to when we could compile all the material we needed to publish the story. All we wanted was a list of names of people in charge of making decisions about which bank gets money under the bailout--information that presumably shouldn't require a FOIA request.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Despite President Obamaâ€™s January 21 directive to agencies to act in the spirit of openness and make an effort to improve the FOIA process, our recent experiences with Treasury,Â  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others that regulate banks and are central to the bailout haven't been much different than our experiences with the Bush administration. Earlier, FOIA requests sent to Treasury took almost the same time, even without the phone calls trying to expedite the process.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The reason Treasury doesn't accept FOIA requests via e-mail is because of an internal regulation that requires the person making a request to submit a signature, according to Hugh Gilmore, the public FOIA liaison for the agency. Treasury also requires that they need a requester to say that they are willing to pay a minimum of $25.00 for the documents requested.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Acknowledging that the number of requests coming into Treasury as a result of the bailout and setting up of the Office of Financial Stability has increased, Gilmore said that they have added eight to ten people to handle the influx. â€œWe are changing the methods used to answer FOIA requests with the increased use of technology, especially for the Office of Financial Stability,â€ Gilmore said. Keeping with the memo Treasury is changing internal policies and will be adopting amended provisions of transparency with regards to FOIA.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""http://www.sunshineingovernment.org/stats/highlights.pdf"">This report </a>by the Sunshine in Government Initiative looks at performance of federal agencies sums up the state of FOIA in 2008, â€œDespite reforms enacted by Congress and an order from the last administration to do a better job, federal agencies continue to give those seeking information a frustrating and oftentimes unsatisfying experience.â€</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In January 2007 when Real Time started to regularly seek logs of correspondence between Members of Congress and federal agencies, we sent out FOIA requests to more than 120 agencies. Only a handful responding in a timely fashion; most required frequent phone calls to follow up on the requests. And in the past two years only a dozen agencies have given us the logs of correspondences in the electronic format we've asked for--that is, as an excel or comma separated format.

<p class=""loose"">In the 2008 Defense Appropriations Act that was signed into law on Nov. 13, the company received two earmarks for a total of $3.6 million to deliver 500 Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºleak proofÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ transmission drip pans for Black Hawks used by the U.S. Army and the National Guard. Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºThe funding would be used to address U.S. Army drip pan needs,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Rogers</st1:place></st1:city> explained in one of the two <a href=""http://www.taxpayer.net/appropsrequestletters/fy08/hdefense/1245_RogersHarold.pdf"">request letters</a> he sent to the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. In a press release, <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Rogers</st1:place></st1:city> was somewhat more effusive about the drip pans, saying that they Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºk<span style=""color: black"">eep troops and patients safer during complicated rescue missions.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ </span></p>
<p class=""loose"">But Army officials say that they have yet to decide if the transmission drip pans should be purchased from Phoenix Products at all.</p>
<p class=""loose"">Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºLast year, Congress directed the Army to examine a new design of a leak-proof drip pan that is manufactured by Phoenix Products Inc.,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ Major Thomas McCuin, Public Affairs Officer with the Army wrote via e-mail, referring to a 2005 earmark that gave $2 million to Phoenix Products, according to the earmarks database maintained by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class=""loose"">A small number of the transmission drip pans have been installed to determine their usefulness; the Army has yet to collect data or determine the results from what McCuin called Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºan informal test.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹</p>
<p class=""loose"">Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºSometime in the coming year, the Army will decide how to proceed,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ he wrote, adding that the modification may be useful. Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºThe three possibilities are: 1) to install these pans on all 1,668 Black Hawk helicopters in the ArmyÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s inventory; 2) to approve the product for optional purchase by unit commanders using their own operations and maintenance funds;  or 3) not to purchase the product at all,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ McCuin wrote.</p>
But Rogers, who serves on the House Appropriations Committee and is the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Homeland Security, has already decided that the pans are worth purchasing.
<p class=""loose"">RogerÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s press office did not return phone calls and refused to give out the e-mail addresses of any of their staff.</p>
<p class=""loose"">The transmission drip pan lies directly under the blades of the helicopter and is used to collect any leaking engine or transmission fluids when the helicopters are in service or in storage. They ensure that the section of the cabin which lies directly beneath the transmission is not stained and the electronic equipment there is not damaged.</p>

<p class=""loose"">Phoenix Products was incorporated in 1973, the companyÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s Web site says. According to online, searchable <a href=""http://apps.sos.ky.gov/business/obdb/showentity.aspx?id=0341598&amp;ct=09&amp;cs=99999"">records</a> maintained by the Kentucky Secretary of StateÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s office, the firmÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s president is Peggy Wilson, and its registered agent is Thomas Gray Wilson. A government contractor, Phoenix Products had a modest amount of business from the Defense DepartmentÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®in 2000, for example, the company had three Pentagon contracts worth a little more than $261,000, according to contract data from FedSpending.org.</p>
<p class=""loose"">In 2004, the company hired a lobbying firm, Martin, Fisher, Thompson and Associates, to inform Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºCongress and the Department of Defense of the availability of composite products, custom interiors and miscellaneous metal parts for aircraft produced by client,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ lobbying records filed with the Senate Office of Public Records show. <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Phoenix</st1:place></st1:city>Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s hired lobbyists pushed the companyÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s agenda with members of Congress and the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class=""loose"">The Defense Appropriations Act passed in 2004 contained a $2 million earmark for the company in the Army operations and maintenance budget, according to <a href=""http://max.omb.gov/earmarks-public/earmarks/earmark_217856.html"">OMBÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s earmark database</a>, which was Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºairdroppedÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ into the bill during conference.</p>

1305	Open notebook: Following stimulus contracts	open-notebook-following-stimulus-contracts	1	"Recovery.gov might not be useful yet for ""following every penny"" of stimulus spending, but with a telephone, Google, USASpending.gov and some luck it might not be that hard. Pretty much at random, I picked out a bunch of congressional press releases touting stimulus dollars going to local communities, and started making calls. Here's some notes on where one inquiry led me.

Rep. Kathy Dahlkemper of Pennsylvania's 3rd district (roughly the northwest corner of the state) put <a href=""http://dahlkemper.house.gov/2009/03/rep-dahlkemper-announces-over-17-million-for-mercer-county-housing-authority.shtml"">this press release</a> on her Web site on March 24, announcing that, ""The Mercer County Housing Authority is slated to receive $1,703,727 as part of the Capital Fund Program."" A second <a href=""http://www.usaspending.gov/faads/faads.php?reptype=r&detail=3&datype=T&sortby=i&busn_indctr=r&database=faads&record_id=20395604&fiscal_year=2009"">reference</a> to the project can be found on USASpending.gov. The ultimate source of the funds is the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

I called Mercer County Housing Authority and the regional HUD office to find out more about the project--what is its status, have contracts been awarded, are they reporting information to federal or state officials and if so what information are they reporting. Based on what I found, I ended up not asking some other questions: How many jobs had been created to date or exactly how much of the $1.7 million has been spent so far. It seems that this particular project is just getting started. I also learned that HUD's time line for spending stimulus dollars only requires that recipients have legally binding contracts in place within a year of funds being awarded--not that they spend a certain percentage of the funds available to them.

Jim Cassidy, director of the HUD Office of Public Housing in Pittsburgh, Pa., said HUD awarded the funds through a block grant formula -- a complicated bit of algebra that divided among public housing authorities the stimulus money available for the Capital Fund Program. Cassidy told me that the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act directed $4 billion to the <a href=""http://portal.hud.gov/portal/page?_pageid=153,7973149&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL"">Capital Fund Program</a>, which pays for development and modernization of public housing. ""$3 billion was awarded on a formula basis,"" he said; housing authorities will compete for the other $1 billion. 

Stimulus spending through the Capital Fund Program is being done on an expedited basis. I don't mean to sound flippant, but expedited for the federal government is a relative term: instead of projects having a four year life cycle, recipients will have to spend it in three years. The expedited time line goes like this: 

<blockquote><b>March 18, 2009:</b> Funds obligated (that is, each public housing authority in the country receives approval letter saying they're getting a certain amount of money)
<b>March 17, 2010:</b> Public housing authorities have to have a legally binding contract (or contracts) in place to spend the money.
By <b>March 17, 2011</b>, Public housing authorities are required to spend at least 60 percent of the stimulus funds they were awarded.
By <b>March 17, 2012</b>, PHAs are required to spend 100 percent of the stimulus funds awarded.</blockquote>

So how is this playing out on the ground? Beth Burkhart, the administrative director of the Mercer County Housing Authority, says they've decided how to spend their stimulus funds -- converting efficiency units in the <a href=""http://www.mercercountyhousingauthority.com/Communities/VermeireManor/tabid/1271/Default.aspx"">Vermeire Manor</a> retirement home to one bedroom apartments -- and that HUD has approved the project. They have some firms lined up to do some of the work (this <a href=""http://classifieds.cnhi.com/categoryadlist?test=1&publishername=sharonherald&adnumkey=0300&categoryname=Public%20Notice&datehunt=2009-06-26"">public notice</a> in the Sharon, Pa., Herald lists them -- Perfido Weiskopf Architects and asbestos contractor AGX, Inc.; they're still looking for help with plumbing, electrical work, HVAC and a general contractor). On July 2, they'll hold a pre-bid conference, with bids due on July 14. 

I asked a lot of questions about what information would be reported to Recovery.gov, but both Cassidy and Burkhart explained that they had yet to receive that guidance from HUD, and just weren't sure yet what the reporting requirements would look like.  

Currently, Recovery.gov has a <a href=""http://www.recovery.gov/sites/default/files/financial_and_activity_report_20090619HUD.xls"">spreadsheet</a> that tells you that $212,155,156 has been obligated for all of all of Pennsylvania under HUD's Capital Fund Program. Mercer County Housing Authority, or even the generic term ""public housing authority,"" doesn't appear. I didn't do as thorough a search, but I couldn't find a reference to the project on Pennsylvania's recovery site (here's the <a href=""http://www.recovery.pa.gov/portal/server.pt?open=514&objID=519121&mode=2&countyname=Mercer&contentid=http://pubcontent.state.pa.us/publishedcontent/publish/marketingsites/recovery_pa_gov/content/impact/county_map/counties/mercer/mercer.html"">page for Mercer County projects</a>)."		2009-06-29 20:55:36	2009-06-29 20:55:36	2009-06-29 20:55:36	1	0	1
1306	PMA Group is gone, but earmark influence persists	1306-revision-3	2	"While the dozen members of Congress most favored by contributions from PMA Group continued to request earmarks for the defunct firm's clients, two other lobby shops--Alcalde &amp; Fay and Innovative Federal Strategies--appear to have had even more success in procuring earmark requests for fiscal year 2010 from the PMA top twelve.

PMA Group, which collapsed amidst a federal investigation into the lobbying firm's campaign contributions, and its clients were prolific donors to members of Congress, showering current members of the House and Senate with than $40.3 million in contributions, an <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/03/pma-group-and-clients-paid-out.html"">analysis</a> by the Center for Responsive Politics found.

After PMA disbanded, six of its clients fled to Flagship Government Relations, which PMA staffers founded just after the firmâ€™s offices were raided by the FBI in February, and after PMAâ€™s principal declined a buyout offer. Three former PMA clients paid the Federal Business Group this year; two each took their business to Van Scoyoc Associates, the Capitol Consulting Group, MKG Consulting LLC, and Park Strategies.

Some of the dozen lawmakers that the Center for Responsive Politics identified as the top recipients of donations continued to request earmarks for organizations that had been clients of the firm at some point since 1998--Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., requested at least nine earmarks for former PMA clients; Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., five; Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., two; Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, two; and Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kansas, one. The ongoing investigation of PMA Group has led Rep. Peter Viscklosky, D-Ind., to distance himself from the lobbying shop as questions swelled around his relationship with it; he requested <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/04/03/visclosky-shuts-out-former-pma-group-clients/"">no earmarks</a> for past clients of the firm for 2010.

Yet when comparing the roster of active clients that PMA Group represented just before it closed its doors (as opposed to those that PMA had represented at any point since 1998) with the current clients of other firms, a different picture emerges. Six of Alcalde &amp; Faye's clients were favored with 15 requests while six clients of Innovative Federal Strategies, a firm with <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/05/26/delving-into-rep-lewis-earmark-requests/"">close ties</a> to Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, were named in a dozen requests. By contrast, six 2008 clients of PMA Group were named in 7 requests.

(*Total contributions from PMA Group and clients to this member.)

Sunlight's analysis is based on an analysis of lobbying and campaign finance data from the Center for Responsive Politics and from the earmark requests that the House Appropriations Committee required members to post online for all fiscal year 2010 earmarks.

The House members who received the most money in contributions from PMA since 1989, according to the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/02/embattled-lobbying-firm-pma-ta.html"">Center for Responsive Politics</a>, are: John Murtha (D-Pa), Pete Viscolosky (D-Ind), Jim Moran (D-Va), Jerry Lewis (R-Calif), Norm Dicks (D-Wash), Bill Young (R-Fla), Ike Skelton (D-Mo), Chet Edwards (D-Texas), Todd Tiahrt (R-Kan), Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ), Kay Granger (R-Texas) and Steny Hoyer (D-Md).

Edwards' earmark requests were not reviewed by the Sunlight Foundation because they were posted in a PDF format that is difficult to analyze digitally. We will analyze his requests in a separate post.

For fiscal year 2010, there were fewer requests for earmarks for former PMA Group clients from the top recipient of their campaign contributions than there were actual, final earmarks received when the lobbying firm was still flying high.

In fiscal year 2008, Murtha and Visclosky each successfully procured 16 earmarks for PMA clients; the next year they obtained six and five, respectively, according to <a href=""http://taxpayer.net/search_by_category.php?action=view&amp;proj_id=2617&amp;category=Earmarks&amp;type=Project"">Taxpayers for Common Sense</a>.

In 2005, the total value of contracts is $471 million; every other year, the total ranges from a low of $2.5 million in 2002 to a high of $19 million in 2006. <a href=""http://www.fedspending.org/fpds/fpds.php?reptype=l&amp;database=fpds&amp;fiscal_year=&amp;first_year_range=&amp;last_year_range=&amp;company_name=&amp;city=&amp;state=&amp;vendor_cd=&amp;ZIPCode=&amp;vendorCountryCode=&amp;contractor_type=&amp;principalNAICSCode=&amp;stateCode=&amp;pop_cd=&amp;placeOfPerformanceZIPCode=&amp;placeOfPerformanceCountryCode=&amp;mod_agency=&amp;mod_fund_agency=97DL&amp;psc_cat=&amp;psc_sub=&amp;descriptionOfContractRequirement=&amp;compete_cat=&amp;dollar_tot=&amp;PIID=&amp;detail=-1&amp;datype=T&amp;email="">See for yourself,</a> and note that the <a href=""http://www.usaspending.gov/fpds/fpds.php?reptype=a&amp;database=fpds&amp;mod_agency=&amp;mod_fund_agency=97DL&amp;PIID=&amp;psc_cat=&amp;psc_sub=&amp;contractor_type=&amp;descriptionOfContractRequirement=&amp;compete_cat=&amp;dollar_tot=&amp;fiscal_year=&amp;first_year_range=&amp;last_year_range=&amp;detail=-1&amp;datype=T&amp;email="">numbers from the federal government</a> are the same.

The Defense Intelligence Agency is one of the Pentagon agencies that <a href=""http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/public_accountability_is_going_down"">reduced transparency</a> by asking for -- and receiving -- permission to withhold from USASpending.gov <a href=""http://www.fas.org/blog/secrecy/2007/12/intel_agencies_to_withhold_con.html"">categories of intelligence contracting data that were previously disclosed</a>, as <a href=""http://www.fas.org/blog/secrecy/"">Secrecy News</a> reports.

Okay, but where is the old data that had been disclosed? Are we to believe that in 2002, the year after Sept. 11, Defense Intelligence Agency contracts declined from $8.8 million to $2.6 million?

I don't mean to criticize the databases themselves -- the folks over at <a href=""http://www.ombwatch.org"">OMB Watch</a> have done a masterful job building <a href=""http://www.fedspending.org"">FedSpending.org</a>--an online compendium of contracts and grants from the year 2000 forward. The federal government provides its own version of the same data, at <a href=""http://usaspending.gov"">USASpending.gov</a>, which is slightly more up to date though lacks a lot of the useful features and enhancements (the mapping in particular) of FedSpending.org. Both sites provide simple, user-friendly, searchable interfaces that let you see how much money <a href=""http://www.fedspending.org/fpds/fpds.php?parent_id=170923&amp;sortby=u&amp;detail=-1&amp;datype=T&amp;reptype=r&amp;database=fpds&amp;fiscal_year=&amp;submit=GO"">Lockheed Martin</a> or <a href=""http://www.usaspending.gov/fpds/fpds.php?parent_id=39643&amp;sortby=u&amp;detail=-1&amp;datype=T&amp;reptype=r&amp;database=fpds&amp;fiscal_year=&amp;submit=GO"">Boeing has gotten over the years. </a> The question is whether the agencies that provide the data are doing so accurately.

It's possible that there's some other explanation for the anomaly -- perhaps the bulk of Defense Intelligence Agency contracts were paid out of the budgets of other agencies and show up elsewhere. I'll call DIA and see what they say.

For an interesting take on why intelligence agencies might want to keep their nonclassified contracts secret, see <a href=""http://www.thespywhobilledme.com/the_spy_who_billed_me/2007/12/dod-withholds-u.html"">this post</a> from the <a href=""http://www.thespywhobilledme.com/the_spy_who_billed_me/"">Spy Who Billed Me</a>."		2007-12-26 16:30:32	2007-12-26 16:30:32	2007-12-26 16:30:32	1	0	1

Over the weekend, I was listened to several Iowa events on CSpan radio. I kept wishing one of the Iowans would ask, say, <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.asp?id=N00002283&amp;cycle=2008"">John Edwards</a> how his administration would react were it approached by lobbyists for his most generous contributor, Fortress Investment Group LLC, about the ""tax treatment of investment companies,"" (one of their issues). Fortress, which used to <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/22/AR2007042201339_pf.html"">employ Edwards</a>, is represented by, among others, former IRS commissioner Fred T.

Or perhaps some corn husker could ask Giuliani where his administration stands on offshore tax shelters; Ernst &amp; Young, <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.asp?id=N00009908&amp;cycle=2008"">his top patron</a>, is currently <a href=""http://sopr.senate.gov/cgi-win/opr_gifviewer.exe?/2007/E/000/157/000157197|6"">lobbying</a> (go to page 5 of the form) on S. 681, the <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?tab=speeches&amp;bill=s110-681"">Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act</a>. When he introduced the bill, Sen.

<blockquote> Abusive tax shelters are another target. Abusive tax shelters are complicated transactions promoted to provide tax benefits unintended by the tax code. They are very different from legitimate tax shelters, such as deducting the interest paid on your home mortgage or Congressionally approved tax deductions for building affordable housing. Some abusive tax shelters involve complicated domestic transactions; others make use of offshore shenanigans. All abusive tax shelters are marked by one characteristic: there is no real economic or business rationale other than tax avoidance. As Judge Learned Hand wrote in Gregory v. Helvering, they are ""entered upon for no other motive but to escape taxation.""</blockquote>
Four current and former Ernst &amp; Young partners <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Business/IndustryInfo/story?id=3226432&amp;page=1"">have been accused</a> of doing just that.

John McCain's ties to lobbyists--especially the 32 lobbyists who are designated fundraisers (the preferred term is bundlers, but there are more <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagman"">colorful terms</a> available to us) for his campaign.

The story does a good job of identifying who these lobbyists are and what interests their firms represent. The Post references <a href=""http://www.citizen.org/documents/IndustryCoding.pdf"">this joint study</a> by <a href=""http://www.citizen.org"">Public Citizen</a> and the <a href=""http://www.cfinst.org/"">Campaign Finance Institute</a>, but it looks to me like their numbers are different than the Post's. The study says that McCain has 20 lobbyists among his bundlers, not 32--see <a href=""http://www.cfinst.org/president/Bundlers08-IndustryCand_Table3.aspx"">this table</a> for the numbers. Public Citizen's White House For Sale <a href=""http://www.whitehouseforsale.org"">site</a> does say there are <a href=""http://whitehouseforsale.org/candidate.cfm?CandidateID=C0005"">32 lobbyists</a> working as bag men for McCain, but the database doesn't include a field that identifies which of the dozens and dozens of those bag men are registered to lobby. Still, it's an incredible resource for looking into the campaigns. I wish we had a similar resource for congressional candidates.

The Post article doesn't mention McCain's topping the <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.asp?id=N00006424&cycle=2008""> list of top donors</a> to his campaign so far in the 2008 cycle is Blank Rome LLP, a law firm with a <a href=""http://www.blankromegr.com/index.cfm?contentID=3"">robust lobbying arm</a>."		2007-12-31 15:18:41	2007-12-31 15:18:41	2007-12-31 15:18:41	1	0	1

To give an idea of how much better it is, I can tell you that with one search that 22 organizations--including top political donors <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.asp?ID=D000000071&amp;Name=Citigroup+Inc"">Citigroup</a>, <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.asp?ID=D000000131&amp;Name=Deloitte+Touche+Tohmatsu"">Deloitte &amp; Touche</a>, <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.asp?ID=D000000098&amp;Name=Ernst+%26+Young"">Ernst &amp; Young</a>, <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.asp?ID=D000000129&amp;Name=Exxon+Mobil"">Exxon Mobil</a> and <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.asp?ID=D000000124&amp;Name=PricewaterhouseCoopers"">PricewaterhouseCoopers</a>,  explicitly mention <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?tab=speeches&amp;bill=s110-681"">S. 681</a>, the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act.

Some notes on the search engine -- when searching for multiple terms, like S. 681 or Comprehensive Immigration Reform, use quotes around the terms -- otherwise, it will return every document with an ""S."" and every document with a ""681."" One drawback--it seems that there's no way to link the lobbying forms themselves (they pop up in a new window without any visible URL in both Firefox and Safari--maybe Explorer will have better luck).

In any case, I stumbled across the enhanced site by chance last night when I went to <a href=""http://sopr.senate.gov"">http://sopr.senate.gov</a>, the regular Senate Web site for looking up lobbying records. If you click on that link, you go back to the regular Senate page. As of this writing, <a href=""http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=choosefields"">this link</a> still gets you to the enhanced data, but I'm wondering whether I just bumped into an alpha or beta test by chance.

Pam Gavin, the superintendent of public records, told me that about 90 percent of the 2007 midyear reports in the lobbying database were filed electronically, so much of the year's records will be searchable.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">I had sent a FOIA to the Small Business Administration offices in <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Washington</st1:city> <st1:state w:st=""on"">D.C.</st1:state></st1:place> for their logs of congressional correspondence. SBA forwarded the request to all of its regional offices and departments--they don't maintain a central log of correspondence. So in the past few days I have received more than a dozen acknowledgement letters and emails from SBAÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s regional offices.<o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Unfortunately, SBA is not is a position to consolidate the material and give us one final response. Essentially, each of the regional offices will treat the FOIA as a separate request which could almost double the number of FOIAs to track. I am talking to few people at SBA to find out if they can collate the information before sending it out.<o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Also, some of the SBA regional offices have misinterpreted the FOIA and have been replying with the actual letters and not the logs. I talked briefly with a FOIA officer at SBA headquarters and she mentioned that SBA does not keep any log in the form of a database, but only a Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºcover sheetÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ which is scanned in with the actual letter. Considering this is how SBA tracks their correspondence, I am not sure we will receive any information on spreadsheets that we can feed into a searchable database.<o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">On a more uplifting note, we received our first correspondence log in an excel format from the Environmental Protection Agency yesterday. Not only was their data perfectly organized and easy to understand, but FOIA Coordinator Deborah Johnson at the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations responded to our request within a week, which is quite commendable.<o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">According to Johnson, only two requests for correspondence logs have been made since she started working at the Office in 1994.

1404	Stimulus Funds Premium Pork?	stimulus-funds-premium-pork	2	"I'm assuming that either there's an error somewhere, or this is really, really good ham. From Recovery.gov's new recipient data comes <a href=""http://www.recovery.gov/?q=content/contracts-recipient-summary&id=12-AG3J14120297196&primeid=27"">this contract</a>, which if I'm reading it right, spends $1,191,200 for ""2 POUND FROZEN HAM SLICED."" 

That seems like an awful lot for ham--even sliced ham. Just a hunch, but they're probably buying tens and tens of thousands of 2 pound frozen hams sliced, but of course that's not apparent from the linked entry.

I just got done writing up some cautionary tales about why one can never take federal data at face value--too bad I didn't have this one at hand for the chapter.

<blockquote>The references to ""2 pound frozen ham sliced"" are to the sizes of the packaging. Press reports suggesting that the Recovery Act spent $1.191 million to buy ""2 pounds of ham"" are wrong. In fact, the contract in question purchased 760,000 pounds of ham for $1.191m, at a cost of approximately $1.50 per pound.</blockquote>

So why didn't the contract description on Recovery.gov list that amount. Taxpayers can't follow every penny if government doesn't tell us how much of a thing it's buying, or, as Drudge does, <a href=""http://foodlion.mywebgrocer.com/CircularItemList.aspx?catid=1195&cc=1&cc=1&s=53078084&g=42d11eeb-ff16-4d28-be37-d258489d37d1&uc=7B35461"">comparison shop</a>.

<blockquote>To shore up its deteriorating finances, Merrill is now in discussions with investors in the United States, Asia and the Middle East, including American private equity firms, to raise about $4 billion in the coming days, these people said.

The developments underscore the rising toll that the mortgage crisis is taking on many once-proud Wall Street banks. In recent months Merrill and several other firms have grabbed financial lifelines from wealthy foreign governments. Further investments by so-called sovereign wealth funds could prompt scrutiny by Congress. 

...

Merrill is hardly alone in seeking capital from overseas. United States financial institutions have raised more than $29 billion from foreign governments and their related investment entities, according to the market research firm Dealogic.

In recent months, the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, SingaporeÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s lesser-known government fund, invested $9.7 billion in UBS; Citigroup sold a $7.5 billion stake to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority; and the China Investment Corporation poured $5 billion into Morgan Stanley.

If a foreign government takes another big stake in Merrill, Congress might ratchet up its scrutiny of sovereign wealth funds, which have ballooned thanks to rising oil prices and booming emerging markets.

On Thursday, SenatorCharles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, expressed concern about the amount of money American financial institutions are contemplating raising from sovereign wealth funds.

Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºForeign investment, in general, strengthens our economy and creates jobs,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ Senator Schumer said. Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºBecause sovereign wealth funds, by definition, are potentially susceptible to noneconomic interests, the closer they come to exercising control and influence, the greater concerns we have.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ </blockquote>

Probably worth noting the <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/orgs/toprecips.asp?ID=D000000108&Type=P&Cycle=A"">investments</a> that Merrill Lynch has made in some U.S. politicians -- Schumer's number two on their list (Merrill Lynch is his <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/politicians/allcontrib.asp?CID=N00001093"">sixth most generous patron</a>), followed by a good chunk of the 2008 presidential field -- Sen. Hillary Clinton ($208,735), Sen. John McCain ($195,000), Sen. Christopher Dodd ($192,350), former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani ($168,950) and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney ($148,600). 

The politicians who have enjoyed Citigroup's largesse can be found <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/orgs/toprecips.asp?ID=D000000071&Type=P&Cycle=A"">here</a> (Clinton tops with list with $642,060 in contributions) while those who have enjoyed Morgan Stanley's favor are <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/orgs/toprecips.asp?ID=D000000106&Type=P&Cycle=A"">here</a> (President George W.

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">The Recovery and Transparency Board will post online a redacted copy of its $9.5 million contract with Smartronix Inc. for the redesign of Recovery.gov this week.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Board chairman Earl Devaney told <em>Government Executive</em> last week that the board would be posting the contract online soon in part to pre-empt formal public records requests from watchdog groups. (The Sunlight Foundation had already submitted such a request for the final contract and winning bid on July 10, after prior efforts to obtain submitted proposals were unsuccessful.)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Officials had declined to make the winning bid, and the resulting contract, available until after a â€œprotest periodâ€ allowing losing bidders to voice complaints.The protest window closed this week with no complaints filed.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">The rule that calls for withholding the contract until the protest period is over raises the obvious question: How was anyone supposed to voice objections without seeing what they were objecting to?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">""Unsuccessful offerors can protest based on several issues that do not require access to the contract document itself,"" a spokeswoman for the General Services Administration said in an e-mail to Sunlight. As for what those issues might include, <a href=""http://www.arnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart%2033_1.html#wp1088680"">I read this and I'm still not quite sure.</a></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">What is clear is that the complaints process is, on its face, designed to protect one contractor from a corrupt or incompetent competitor, government agency or both, and that it's also one of the layers of red tape that often mar contracting's reputation, inflating costs and extending deadlines.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">In the end, theoretically, justice will be served, albeit at a snail's pace. The disclosure of the contract comes on a similar time frame, an official seemed to acknowledge.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">""We will get the contract up. It just might not be instantaneous as some would want,"" Devaney said in theÂ  <em>Government Executive</em> interview.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">The Recovery.gov contracting process, on the other hand, has been marked by seemingly nearly insurmountable deadlines. On June 15, the request for proposals was made available only to the select group of approved contractors eligible to bid, and those companies were given 11 days to prepare a complete proposal in response to the 47-page document.<span> </span>Some critics suggested that time frame could be met only by contractors with advance knowledge of the criteria.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">The Sunlight Foundation obtained a copy of the document and posted it online shortly after it was made available to potential bidders. The board made it public only after the winning bidder had been announced, and only then linking to Sunlightâ€™s scan of the document.</p>"		2009-07-22 18:30:51	2009-07-22 18:30:51	2009-07-22 18:30:51	1	0	1
1417	Less than three percent Palin's itemized PAC contributions from Alaskans	less-than-three-percent-palins-itemized-pac-contributions-from-alaskans	27	"Less than three percent of the itemized money raised by resigning Alaska Governor Sarah Palin's leadership PAC came from Alaskans, newly filed campaign finance reports show. SarahPAC reported raising  more than $730,000 in the last six months--less than half of the $1.6 million raised by Mitt Romney's PAC.

Both names have been mentioned as potential 2012 Republican presidential candidates, and the non-campaign, federal-level political action committee accounts are sometimes used to lay the infrastructure for a later bid, financing travel and winning over fellow politicians with donations to their campaigns.

The reports do not provide information on donors giving less than $200, so residences of small donors aren't known. Larger donors made up about $312,000 of Palin's haul, of which $8,401 came from Alaskans. Twenty Alaskan residents are listed as contributing, only one of whom lives in Palin's hometown of Wasilla, where she served a term as mayor.

New York State topped the geographical list of donors at $61,000, followed by Florida, Texas, California, Connecticut, Virginia, Georgia, New Mexico and Maryland.

$15,000 came from seven donors listing their employer as IGHL, or Independent Group Home Living, an association for parents of special-needs children, which named Palin as a guest of honor at its gala last month.

While PACs are designed to raise money to disburse to other candidates as a sign of support--rather than engage in campaining for the administrator of the account, Palin wrote only two checks to fellow politicians: $5,000 to former running mate John McCain and $5,000 to Alaskan Senator Lisa Murkowski."		2009-07-22 17:19:57	2009-07-22 17:19:57	2009-07-22 17:19:57	1	0	1
142	"Investing in ""US Inc."""	investing-in-us-inc	2	"Citigroup <a href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c6eb81e0-c083-11dc-b0b7-0000779fd2ac.html""> reportedly</a> is looking to raise additional foreign capital:

<blockquote>Citigroup is putting the final touches to its second big capital-raising effort in as many months, seeking up to $14bn from Chinese, Kuwaiti and public market investors.

Under the proposal being discussed, the bulk of the money Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¬ roughly $9bn Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¬ would be most likely to come from China, people familiar with the negotiations say. The Kuwait Investment Authority would contribute about $1bn, while $2bn to $4bn would be raised through a public placement of shares.</blockquote>

The article, from the <i>Financial Times</i>, notes that Citigroup's attempt to shore up its finances by seeking of more offshore cash ""underscores the depth of the problems faced by banks that suffered heavy losses in the US subprime mortgage crisis,"" and adds,

<blockquote>As more US financial institutions raise capital from foreign sources, largely from sovereign wealth funds, there is a growing debate about the potential domestic political reaction, particularly during a presidential election year.</blockquote>

Interestingly, the presidential candidates have been rather quiet about this aspect of the mortgage crisis. Perhaps that's because Citigroup is a top contributor to the presidential campaigns of <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.asp?id=N00000019&cycle=2008"">Sen. Hillary Clinton</a>, <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/pres08/summary.asp?id=N00009638&cycle=2008"">Sen. Barack Obama</a>, <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.asp?id=N00002283&cycle=2008"">John  Edwards</a>, <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.asp?id=N00000286&cycle=2008"">Mitt Romney</a>, <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.asp?id=N00009908&cycle=2008"">Rudy Giuliani</a>, <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.asp?id=N00006424&cycle=2008"">Sen. John McCain</a> and <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.asp?id=N00003136&cycle=2008"">Fred Thompson</a>.

The <i>Financial Times</i> story explains why Citigroup, which already went through one round of raising foreign capital, is able to do so again:

<blockquote>Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºThe second round is going very well, because Citi is seen as US Inc,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ says the regional head of a US investment bank in the Middle East.</blockquote>

144	Inspector General launches probe of Traffic.com contracts	inspector-general-launches-probe-of-trafficcom-contracts	2	"Transportation's Inspector General has launched an investigation of the <a href=""http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/travelinfo/ttidprogram/ttidprogram.htm"">Transportation Technology Innovation and Demonstration</a> program--at the request of a pair of members of Congress, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y.--to determine whether the program, as administered by the <a href=""http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/"">Federal Highway Administration</a>, fulfilled the goals set for it by Congress and whether FHWA met competitive procurement requirements that ""intended to expand the number of firms providing surveillance services.""

A brief announcement is <a href=""http://www.oig.dot.gov/item.jsp?id=2220"">here</a> and the full release is <a href=""http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=/data/pdfdocs/TTID.pdf"">here</a>.

Congress launched TTID (the original alphabet soup name for the program was ITIP -- the Intelligent Transportation Infrastructure Program) in 1998, when it enacted the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), and appropriators set aside the vast sum of $8 million to build an Intelligent Transportation System in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. A company originally called Argus Networks, then Mobility Technologies, then Traffic.com, got the work. They're supposed to install sensors on highways and roads, and using them to track and publicize real time traffic information so commuters can avoid traffic jams.

In 2001, a pair of Pennsylvania politicians--Rep. Bud Shuster (since retired and replaced in office by his son) and Sen. Arlen Specter (still serving) earmarked an extra $50 million to expand the program to 25 more cities. Transportation tried to open the $50 million to competitive bidding, but a series of outraged letters from members of Congress made it clear that they'd already picked the winning bidder. (A lot of this history is covered in an April 2005 story in <em>The Hill</em>, which sadly does not seem to be online anymore but is quoted <a href=""http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/node/2118"">here</a>; James Ridgway updates the story <a href=""http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/hogging_the_road"">here</a>.)

Traffic.com and its various parent companies (it's currently owned by Navteq) have been <a href=""http://thehill.com/business--lobby/monopoly-continues-for-pa.-company-says-hatch-2007-06-26.html"">rather prolific lobbying clients</a> -- 

<blockquote>Since 2000, the company, under its different names, has spent more than $900,000 on lobbying fees with at least 10 firms, according to Senate disclosure forms. </blockquote>

It will be interesting to see what the IG's probe turns up. In the mean time, I'm going to try to do a little reporting over the next couple of weeks to see if there are stones still unturned on this story. As a few of these links show, some fine reporters have already dug into it (as have <a href=""http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/state_to_get_only_part_of_data_from_new_traffic_sensors"">others</a>, I hasten to add) so I'm not especially hopeful. However, I'm supposed to get, in the next week or so, a hefty cache of Traffic.com documents from a FOIA request I filed nearly a year ago, so perhaps there's reason for optimism."		2008-02-05 04:55:06	2008-02-05 04:55:06	2008-02-05 04:55:06	1	0	1
1444	Bush DOJ emails: â€œ30% approval makes it a lot harder to push back, unfortunately.â€	bush-doj-emails-%e2%80%9c30-approval-makes-it-a-lot-harder-to-push-back-unfortunately-%e2%80%9d	1	"Internal Bush Administration <a href=""http://judiciary.house.gov/issues/issues_WHDocs.html"">emails released by the Senate Judiciary Committee </a>lend some insight into the culture of political operatives, administration officials and the space in between during the Department of Justiceâ€™s replacement of U.S. Attorneys and subsequent investigation.

The thousands of pages of emails and documents reveal an administration hostile to Congress and racing to find out what reporters know. While there is little definitive evidence in the documents that the attorneys were fired for political reasonsâ€”or if they were, who among the authors knewâ€”there is no shortage of colorful rhetoric.

Sunlight attempted to harness the content of the many large files into a simple text file to make the vast amount of content searchable for the public, but the scanned images did not digitize well. But donâ€™t fret: Here are some of the more interesting exchanges observed by the Sunlight Foundation:

<strong>***</strong>

In response to Sen. Dianne Feinsteinâ€™s insistence on the Senate floor that US Attorneys may have been fired for political reasons, a top Justice staffer and Deputy Counsel to President George W. Bush wrote in an email thread in January 2007:
<blockquote>William Kelley (Deputy Counsel): Gulp

Kyle Sampson (Justice Chief of Staff): basically

William Kelley: And sheâ€™s not backing off? What does she say? â€œI donâ€™t believe you, Mr. Attorney General?â€

Kyle Sampson: Already done. And AG did sincerely and credibly deliver. And all I can say is that <strong>she is dumb as a post</strong>.

William Kelley: Â I think the AG should talk to Senator Feinstein privately and clear the air. I canâ€™t believe that she wouldnâ€™t accept his explanation, which not only would be sincerely and credibly delivered, but <strong>would also have the virtue of being nothing but the truth</strong>. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>
<strong>***</strong>

When a USA Today reporter implied that one of the attorneys, Bud Cummins, was pushed out to make room for a more Bush-friendly appointee, Bush aide Sara Taylor wrote: ""I normally donâ€™t like attacking our friends, but since Bud Cummins is talking to everyone â€“ why donâ€™t we tell the deal on him?""

When the New York Times editorialized criticizing Griffin, Tim himself appears to have authored an editorial for placement in the Times. ""Who do you want to sign?,"" Taylor asked. â€œ[John] Cornyn to the nyt would be awesome. Or [Pete] sessions. I think they would be awesome because they are on judiciary.""

<strong>***</strong>

Bush press secretary Dana Perino and DOJ spokesman Brian Roehrkasse on coverage of the controversy by the Washington Postâ€™s John Solomon and the New York Timesâ€™ Eric Lipton:
<blockquote>Perino: â€œThe wp was much better than this. Plus they really distort harrietâ€™s [Harriet Myers']Â  involvement.â€

Roehrkasse: â€œI knowâ€¦ which is change consider the post coverage with eggen has been SO bad. But the post bring in john Solomon and becomes far more fair in their coverageÂ  and the times brings in eric lipton and becomes far worse.â€</blockquote>
Roehkasse then wrote to NYT reporter Eric Lichtblau: â€œI am severely disappointed in your story todayâ€¦ Frankly, I expected far better reporting from you and am disappointed that you gave into the pressure to sensationalize.â€

<strong>***</strong>

In December 2006, after US Attorney John McKay was rejected from a judgeship, lawyer Michael McKay writes: ""Brother John received a call from the White House Counselâ€™s office yesterday. During that call he was informed that he will not be nominated for the Federal judge position hereâ€¦ Since 1980, I have been a strong member of the Bush team. Please know that, in spite of this deep disappointment, I remain so and am available to help if there is anything I can do for you or your office out here in the Pacific Northwest.""

<strong>***</strong>

On January 6, 2007, New Mexico state senator Rod Adair wrote to Karl Rove: â€œThis is a rare moment when a matter is of such importance that I must contact youâ€¦ [New Mexico U.S. Attorney candidate Chuck Peifer] is a wuss, a cowardly wuss, who will disappoint.â€

Rove then referred him to the New Mexico congressional delegation, but Sen. Pete Domenici supported Peifer. Asked about Domeniciâ€™s reasoning, a staffer, Steve Bell, wrote to Rove of the situation: â€œit is petty and boring; peifer comes with very high recommendationsâ€¦ he was Judge Browningâ€™s law partner for more than a decade and Browning thinks the world of himâ€¦ and Browning is truly one of ours!â€

<strong>***</strong>

Three days later, as Rove dispensed advice to interim U.S. attorney Tim Griffin, a former employee, on his confirmation hearing:
<blockquote>Griffin: â€œI think both Lincoln and pryor went better than I expectedâ€¦ pryor suggested I withdraw my name if I get stuck in the senate. I told him I couldnâ€™t promise to do that. I hope yall hang in there with me. Thank you tgâ€

Karl: â€œWe willâ€”you stay strong!â€

<strong>Griffin: â€œWill do. Thank you. Btw my wife is pregnant. We are thinking about naming him karl. Lol""</strong> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>
<strong>***</strong>
<blockquote>Scott Jennings in reference to a news article: â€œHave you been following this? Unbelievable.â€

Coddy Johnson: â€œIt is crazy â€“ 'cronygate' â€“<strong> reid is a jackass </strong>(Emphasis added.)

Jennings: remarkable considering that USATTORNEYS, like all other political appointments in the federal govt, servce at the PLEASURE OF THE PRESIDENT.â€

Jo Bonner, R-Ala., over Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.,</a> for an open slot on the House Appropriations Committee.

I thought I'd do a little open research on Bonner's fiscal year 2008 earmarks, a complete list of which can be downloaded <a href=""http://taxpayer.net/budget/fy08earmarks/fy08databasemain.html"">here</a> from our friends at Taxpayers for Common Sense. Bonner was the sole House sponsor of 14 earmarks worth more than $17 million (ten were also sponsored by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., one by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and one by both Shelby and Sessions, so Bonner was the sole sponsor of just two earmarks). Bonner also co-sponsored a $4.5 million earmark with Rep. Artur Davis, D-Ala., joined by Shelby and Sessions from the Senate, another with Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., for $3.7 million, joined by Shelby, and another with fellow Alabama Republicans Rep. Robert B. Aderholt and Rep. Mike Rogers for more than $1.3 million. Rep. Michael Arcuri, D-NY, and Bonner cosponsored a $3 million earmark (joined by Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Charles Schumer, both Democrats from New York).

I'm attaching a cut and pasted <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Bonnermarks.xls"">spreadsheet</a> with all of Bonner's earmarks, culled from Taxpayers' big kahuna file. More later..."		2008-02-20 22:41:58	2008-02-23 03:00:37	2008-02-20 22:41:58	1	0	1
1468	Adding it up: The top players in foreign agent lobbying	adding-it-up-the-top-players-in-foreign-agent-lobbying	3	"It isnâ€™t just U.S. companies or groups that push for their causes on Capitol Hill. Thousands of times each year, lobbyists for foreign governments and other overseas organizations reach out to members of Congress and other U.S. leaders to make their case on issues important to them.

But counting up those thousands of contacts hasnâ€™t been easy. Records detailing what foreign entities are lobbying, who theyâ€™re contacting and why are filed on paper forms, sometimes in handwriting thatâ€™s little more than a scrawl. After prodding from open-government groups, the Department of Justice put scanned copies of the forms on its Web site in 2007, but in a fashion thatâ€™s barely an advance over the old-fashioned card catalog.

Now, the Sunlight Foundation and ProPublica have taken more than a yearâ€™s worth of data filed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, and put it in a digital format that can be easily searched and analyzed to discover all the players in the foreign lobbying game.

Under FARA, all lobbyists who represent foreign governments, political parties and government-controlled entities in a â€œpolitical or quasi-political capacityâ€ must file disclosures. The forms list activities, fees received, political contacts and any campaign contributions.

Data for this project is based on filings in calendar 2008. The reports cover lobbying activity that year and in late 2007, and provide an extensive look into how foreign countries advanced their interests in Washington, D.C., during the period.

Among the overall findings:
<ul>
	<li>Lobbyists for various foreign agents, including a handful of for-profit corporations, disclosed receiving $87 million in fees during the period.</li>
	<li>Lobbyists contacted congressional offices more than 10,700 times, including 2,280 meetings, nearly 2,600 phone conversations and more than 4,000 e-mails, with the balance of contacts in letters and faxes.</li>
	<li>Countries that engaged in the most intensive lobbying campaigns include long-term allies like Turkey and recent adversaries like Libya. Wealthy countries like the oil-rich United Arab  Emirates are players, but so are poor nations like Ethiopia, with a per capita GDP of just $800.</li>
</ul>
What follows is a look at the countries and lobbyists that have been most active, what some of them wanted, whom they contacted and how much they spent pursuing their goals.

<strong>Where the big spenders are </strong>

Interests in the United Arab Emirates, primarily Dubai, spent the most money on lobbying and public relations campaigns. (Iraqâ€™s spending also includes the Kurdistan Regional Government.)

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Spotlight: Dubai</span>

Until it was branded a threat to national security and a federation with â€œa dubious record on terrorism,â€ the United Arab Emirates spent modest amounts on foreign lobbying, while Dubai, one of its semi-autonomous emirates, spent nothing.

Dubaiâ€™s troubles began in February 2006, when Dubai Port World, a government-owned marine terminal management company, acquired a company with contracts to perform stevedoring operations around the world, including at a handful of U.S. ports. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., charged that the deal would compromise U.S. port security and labeled the U.A.E. a â€œcountry that has been linked to terrorism.â€ Other members of Congress soon echoed the charges. Dubai Port World and the government of Dubai hired lobbyists and public relations firms to blunt the charges, but it was too late: Dubai Port World sold the U.S. port business to another company.

The emirate had learned its lesson. By March 2007, when another government-owned firm, Dubai Aerospace Enterprises, acquired a pair of aviation companies with operations at U.S. airports, Dubai already had in place a sophisticated lobbying operation that contacted some of the harshest critics of the ports deal to gain their support. Dubaiâ€™s government relied on three firms to burnish its image: <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?lname=DLA+Piper&amp;year=2009"">DLA Piper</a> focused on pushing political interests, the Mark Saylor Company focused on crisis communications and Levick Strategic Communications handled press outreach and public relations campaigns.

According to 2008 FARA filings, the Dubai government paid more than $4.6 million in fees to the three firms. Dubai Aerospace completed its acquisition in July 2007 without protest from Congress.

The countryâ€™s public relations campaign continued in 2008. Lobbyists promoted such initiatives as â€œDubai Cares,â€ to help educate children in developing countries. They fielded questions about the ruling familyâ€™s alleged abuse of jockeys in camel racing, and about Dubaiâ€™s sovereign wealth funds. The firmsâ€™ lobbyists met with dozens of congressional staffers. They pitched U.S. media on stories such as economic development, Dubaiâ€™s transit system and a â€œStar Warsâ€ theme park.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Spotlight: Japan</span>

The government of Japan has focused largely on trade through organizations like the <a href=""http://www.jetro.org/"">Japanese External Trade Organization</a> (JETRO) and the <a href=""http://www.mipro.or.jp/english/"">Manufactured Imports and Investment Promotion Organization</a> (MIPRO). The country also employs lobbyists from <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?lname=Hogan+%26+Hartson&amp;year=2009"">Hogan &amp; Hartson</a> to lobby on a range of issues from blocking congressional resolutions admonishing the conduct of the Imperial Army in the Second World War to gaining a permanent seat for Japan on the United Nations Security Council.

In 2008, lobbyists for Japan met with at least five members of Congress to lobby on defense appropriations and to influence policy on the foreign sales of a military aircraft, the F-22 Raptor. The Obama administration and Congress ended U.S. funding for the F-22, but the House Armed Services Committee directed the Obama administration to look into supplying the fighter jets to Japan.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Spotlight: Pakistan</span>

Pakistan made frequent use of lobbyists when it sought to convince Democratic majorities in Congress to go along with the Bush administrationâ€™s plans for â€œReconstruction Opportunity Zones,â€ or preferential trade zones that would be able to export commodities manufactured there duty-free to the United   States. Establishing the zones would spur economic development, would decrease unrest in some of Pakistanâ€™s more lawless and underdeveloped regions, particularly on its frontier with Afghanistan, proponents say. The bill to authorize them died in committee in the last Congress, but has been taken up again this year.

Pakistanâ€™s lobbyists also performed damage control over foreign aid â€” not the first time the country has had to manage the feat. Assistance to Pakistan was halted in 1998 after it conducted at least five nuclear tests, and was not restored until the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, when the Bush administration sought allies in its struggle against al-Qaida. Following a <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08806.pdf"">June 2008 Government Accountability Office</a> finding that the Pentagon couldnâ€™t track more than $5.5 billion in military aid, Pakistanâ€™s FARA lobbyists made 104 contacts with seven journalists concerning the GAO report and the â€œstatus of U.S. aid.â€ The Pakistani Embassy paid $514,000 in lobbyist fees.

<strong><em>* </em></strong><em>Note: Lobbyists for Paul Calder LeRoux, a dual citizen of South Africa and Australia who lives in the Philippines, reported receiving $6,500,000 in fees. The Justice Department classifies LeRoux as ""international"" rather than assigning him to any individual country; as such, we have omitted him from this chart.</em> <em>LeRoux hired the firm,Â Dickens &amp; Madson,Â to ""generate policies favorable to [his] business interests,"" according to FARA filings, principally his effort to lease farmland from the government of Zimbabwe. The firm reported no contacts on LeRoux's behalf; according to FARA records, Dickens &amp; Madson stopped representing LaRoux in December 2008.</em>

<strong>Most congressional contacts</strong>

Turkeyâ€™s lobbying drive to block a resolution branding the 1915 slaughter of Armenians as genocide resulted in the most contacts with members of Congress. (See related story<a href=""#_msocom_1"">[t1]</a> .)

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Spotlight: Egypt</span>

Egypt, historically one of the largest recipients of U.S. foreign aid, mounted a large lobbying effort, employing <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?lname=PLM+Group&amp;year=2008"">PLM Group</a> â€” a joint venture of two well-connected K Street firms, the Podesta Group, headed by Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta, and the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?lname=Livingston+Group&amp;year=2009"">Livingston Group</a>, founded by former Republican Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana â€” to preserve that funding between October 2007 and October 2008. The stakes are not small: Egypt has received more than $50 billion from the United   States since 1975.

The United States agreed to large foreign aid payments to Egypt and Israel in 1978 following the historic peace agreement negotiated by Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin. As the Arab nationâ€™s economy has eroded, excess American aid has allowed it to put off much-needed changes rather than spur them, critics say.

Lobbyists for Egypt had at least 279 contacts on military issues, the bulk of which occurred when PLM Group accompanied delegations of Egyptian military officers to meet members of Congress, administration officials and representatives from defense contractors â€” including BAE Systems, General Dynamics, General Electric, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. All five have done business with the Egyptian government, selling tanks, fighter jets, howitzers and radar arrays to its military. At the time of the meeting with the contractors, Podesta Group counted BAE Systems, General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin among its clients, while the Livingston Group represented Raytheon.

<strong>Top lobbyists</strong>

Two of the top three best-paid lobbying firms were also among the busiest contacting government officials: DLA Piper and the Livingston Group.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Spotlight: DLA Piper</span>

<a href=""http://www.dlapiper.com/"">DLA Piper</a>, a firm whose Web site says is â€œpositioned to help companies with their legal needs anywhere in the world,â€ is well suited to helping them in Washington, with a roster of 39 former government officials that includes former House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt. Until his resignation last week, former House GOP leader Richard Armey also worked with the firm. The firm represented some of the most active foreign clients, including Ethiopia, the executive office of Dubai, and the government of Turkey, for whom it promised, among other things, to find â€œmembers of Congress who will speak in Turkeyâ€™s favor on matters of critical importance to Turkey.â€ DLA Piper helped Borse Dubai, a United Arab Emirates company that invests in stock exchanges, when a hefty investment by the firm in the Nasdaq market required approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an inter-agency committee that reviews foreign investments in the United States that might affect national security. The firm also lobbied to keep a sizable U.S. military presence in the German state of <a href=""http://germany.usembassy.gov/root/pdfs/policy/ga_rheinland_pfalz.pdf"">Rheinland-Pfalz</a> and tried to ease sanctions on <a href=""http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2846.htm"">Ivory</a> Coast.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Spotlight: Rep. Robert Wexler </span>

<a href=""http://wexler.house.gov/"">Wexler, D-Fla</a>., was the most sought after; he or members of his staff were contacted 173 times, according to the filings. Azerbaijan, which hired the Livingston Group to lobby on its behalf, was among Wexlerâ€™s top petitioners. Both Lydia Borland and Robert Livingston of the Livingston Group met with staffers working with Wexler, who serves as co-chairman of the Azerbaijan Caucus. Wexler <a href=""http://wexler.house.gov/pdfs/azerbaijantrade.pdf"">introduced a bill</a> to repeal earlier legislation that related to the country as a post-Soviet state and led to normal trade relations with Azerbaijan. The strategically important country, which has both Iran and Russia as neighbors, has spent close to $2 million since late 2005 seeking better trade and investment opportunities from the United   States, according to FARA records.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Spotlight: Rep. Roy Blunt</span>

<a href=""http://www.blunt.house.gov/"">Blunt, R-Mo.,</a> the former Republican House whip, and his staff were contacted at least 105 times by lobbyists of various foreign governments and organizations. Blunt and his taff had several meetings and phone conversations with lobbyists for both Peru and Panama regarding their free trade agreements. A few days before the passage of the U.S. Peru Free Trade Act, lobbyists for the country met with Bluntâ€™s staffers regarding the bill. The trade pact passed with support from Republicans in Congress; 116 Democrats voted against it. The Panamanian Embassy used the Washington Group to intensively lobby Congress in October and November 2008 to pass an agreement. Blunt and his staff were contacted multiple times.

<strong>Top campaign contributors</strong>

Registered foreign agents reported $4.3 million in political contributions, including nearly $2 million to congressional campaigns. There were at least 74 instances in which lobbyists reported campaign donations to individual members they had contacted.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Spotlight: Who gave</span>

Of the 74 donations FARA agents made to members theyâ€™d personally contacted, 34 came from lobbyists working for a single firm, the PLM Group. PLM was formed in March 2007 as a joint venture of the Livingston Group and the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Podesta+Group&amp;year=2008"">Podesta Group</a>. In all, lobbyists with the PLM Group reported giving nearly $63,000 to members of Congress. Three of the contributions made to Reps. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., Dan Burton, R-Ind., and Donald M. Payne, D-N.J., came on the same day they met with lobbyists.

Bob Dole, the former Senate majority leader and the 1996 Republican presidential nominee, contributed the most among registered foreign agents â€” $104,000. Dole, who lobbies for <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Alston+%26+Bird&amp;year=2008"">Alston &amp; Bird</a>, wasnâ€™t nearly as active as Livingston, FARA records show. Most of his activity, on behalf of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office of Taiwan, was confined to writing letters to members, either inviting them to Taiwan or thanking them for meeting with Taiwanese officials. Dole attended a briefing on investment opportunities in Montenegro, another Alston &amp; Bird client.

Livingston contributed more than $99,000. Other PLM group lobbyists who have given liberally include Paul Cambon, J. Allen Martin, Tony Podesta and former Democratic Rep. Toby Moffett.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Spotlight: Who received</span>

Overall, the presidential campaigns of John McCain and Hillary Clinton topped the list, taking in $202,000 and $71,000 respectively. Among congressional campaigns, successful Senate candidate Mark Warner, D-Va., received the most money from FARA registrants â€” more than $44,000. Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., was next with $38,000, followed by the House Republican leader, John Boehner of Ohio, with $34,000."		2009-08-18 18:19:56	2009-08-18 18:19:56	2009-08-18 18:19:56	1	0	1
1489	Opening the Window on Foreign Lobbying	1489-revision	3	"In 2008, Bermudaâ€™s influential reinsurance industry needed some help. Successive seasons of monster hurricanes in the United States, where much of its client base is, had cost these <a href=""http://www.abir.bm/"">insurers of insurance companies</a> $22 billion in losses. Eager to avoid a repeat â€” and unable to change the weather â€” the companies and Bermudaâ€™s government turned to something they could influence: The U.S. Congress.

At the behest of  his governmentâ€™s lobbyist, Premier Ewart Brown of Bermuda met in June with key congressmen, among them the powerful House Ways and Means chairman, Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and two Democrats from states in <a href=""http://www.hurricanealley.net/HAnaclimo.htm"">hurricane alley</a>, G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina and Bennie Thompson of Mississippi.

The sessions, Brown boasted later in Bermudaâ€™s Royal Gazette, were part of a â€œvery successful tripâ€ that included â€œmeetings with people who were not even on the schedule.â€

In fact, the success was almost immediate. <a href=""https://www.propublica.org/feature/opening-the-window-on-foreign-lobbying-718"">Read more...</a>"		2009-08-18 19:51:11	2009-08-18 19:51:11	2009-08-18 19:51:11	1	0	1
149	Following Bonner's earmarks	following-bonners-earmarks	2	"Let's start with <a href=""http://earmarkwatch.org/earmark/40803/"">this earmark</a>, because it's already in <a href=""http://www.earmarkwatch.org"">EarmarkWatch.org</a>, and hence easy to research. A few interesting notes...

Providence Hospital is the beneficiary of the earmark (the final amount of the Earmark was $1.2 million, not the $1.5 million that EarmarkWatch, which draws on older data, shows). One of their <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/lobbyists/clientsum.asp?txtname=Providence+Hospital&year=2007"">two lobbying firms</a> is Cassidy & Associates. In the <a href=""http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=76CEF230-E3C4-44E8-BF80-1D20FE338701"">midyear 2007 lobbying disclosure filing</a>, the firm disclosed that the specific issue on which they lobbied was ""National Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008-healthcare."" (See page two of the form).

I hopped over to <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org"">OpenSecrets.org</a>, and looked to see if employees of either Providence Hospital or Cassidy & Associates had contributed to Bonner. Not a whole lot of money: Clark Christianson, the hospital's administrator (his picture is on the <a href=""http://www.providencehospital.org/websites/ProvidenceHospital/ProvidenceHospital/"">home page</a> of the hospital), donated $1,000 on June 30, 2006. From June 30, 2004 through June 28, 2007, Cassidy & Associates employees donated $5,150. The bulk of that amount--$3,900--was contributed by Michael Galloway, who happens to have been one of the lobbyists listed on Cassidy's mid-year 2007 disclosure form. I googled Galloway, and found <a href=""http://www.cassidy.com/press/pressdetail.asp?Id=37"">this old press release</a>:

<blockquote><b>Spring Brings New Growth to Cassidy & Associates</b>

Washington, D.C.  Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®  Today Gerald S. J. Cassidy, Chairman and CEO of Cassidy & Associates announced that the firm would be welcoming several new hires over the next few weeks.

Jo Bonner, R-Ala., has sponsored, but while I was looking at them, I came across <a href=""http://aderholt.house.gov/?sectionid=2&sectiontree=2"">the official biography</a> that Rep. Robert B. Aderholt, another Alabama Republican, has on his Web site. The language is instructive:

<blockquote>Congressman Aderholt serves on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, as a member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee and the Commerce Justice, Science and Related Agencies Subcommittee.... 

Congressman Aderholt has continued to work toward bringing record levels of funding to Alabama for transportation projects. Congressman Aderholt campaigned on a promise to continue his commitment to improve transportation in Alabama. This commitment involves making roads safer, improving economic development, and creating more jobs for the Fourth Congressional District and all of Alabama. ...

Congressman Aderholt believes that the federal government has a role in assisting state and local projects as well as economic development efforts. At the same time he believes in responsible budgeting and feels that with an appropriate balance, Congress can work to make sure the government operates within its means. </blockquote>

Responsible budgeting and record levels of funding for Alabama transportation projects."		2008-02-23 03:13:40	2008-02-23 03:13:40	2008-02-23 03:13:40	1	0	1
1505	Raising Their Ugland House: Cayman Islands Lobbies to Keep Haven Safe	1505-revision-5	2	"When President Barack Obama <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-By-The-President-On-International-Tax-Policy-Reform/"">promised</a> in May to raise an additional $210 billion in taxes a year by closing corporate loopholes and cracking down on individual tax cheats, he pointed to an address in the Cayman Islands listed by 12,000 corporations as the kind of abuse his proposals would shut down. ""Either this is the largest building in the world or the largest tax scam in the world,"" the President said.

The line, recycled from his stump speech, was one that the Caribbean jurisdiction had responded to many times before. They have defended Ugland House, the building Obama referred to, and argued that the Cayman Islands are well regulated and transparent, to presidential candidates, executive branch officials, members of Congress and their staffs. In a revenue starved Washington, they're not the only tax haven lobbying.

Disclosures filed in 2008 show that six governments--Aruba, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Isle of Man, Liechtenstein and the States of Jersey--and the Bank of the Netherlands Antilles employed U.S. lobbyists, paying a total of $2.3 million in fees. Those lobbyists had at least 222 contacts with members of Congress, their staff and executive branch officials in which they discussed tax laws, legislation aimed at tax havens like the <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s681/show"">Stop Tax Haven Abuse</a> bill, or efforts to negotiate tax exchange information agreements with the United States and other countries, a review of data in <a href=""http://www.foreignlobbying.org"">Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker</a> (online at <a href=""http://www.foreignlobbying.org"">www.foreignlobbying.org</a>) shows. 

Signing or even committing to sign such agreements earns tax havens a stamp of approval from the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, an international body of developed countries that promotes policies that will spur development elsewhere. In 1998, the OECD launched an initiative aimed at shutting down tax havens; by 2001, the effort had fallen apart, and the body turned instead to encouraging havens to agree to exchange information on their offshore clients with foreign governments on request.

Critics charge that these agreements don't go far enough--while they allow governments to get information on taxpayers who they know have foreign accounts, they don't allow governments to get lists of all their citizens using foreign accounts. The demand of the U.S. government for just such a list of American clients drove its lawsuit against Swiss bank UBS, which <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090819-710134.html"">was settled</a> when the firm agreed to provide the requested information.

While the Obama administration has signaled its intent to go after offshore shelters, four other jurisdictions that are considered tax havens--Luxembourg, Malta, Singapore and the dual island nation Antigua and Barbuda--have signed up new Washington lobbyists in 2009 to represent them on tax matters, while Bermuda has added two new firms.

Among the available disclosures for 2009, the busiest firm has been Fleishman-Hillard, which lobbies for the Cayman Islands government's finance ministry, disclosed 46 contacts with members of Congress and staff, focusing mostly on members of the House Ways and Means Committee.

Ted Bravakis, the public relations director for Cayman Islands Ministry of Financial Services, said that the meetings ""are to ensure open lines of communication with U.S. lawmakers,"" adding that they don't lobby lawmakers or the administration on tax laws the U.S. should or shouldn't adopt.

The jurisdiction does keep a wary eye on its reputation. ""It is important to underline the fact that the financial services sector in the Cayman Islands is not built around tax evasion,"" he said, stressing its agreements to share information and its early acceptance of OECD standards. ""That we're uncooperative, that's the premise on which we have taken clear exception to. On those areas where we are mentioned or identified is what we watch.""

And disclosures show that they watched a lot more than just <a href=""http://www.uglandhouse.ky"">Ugland House</a>, which is the home of a <a href=""http://www.maplesandcalder.com/"">law firm</a> that provides services to corporations it registers and that have little physical presence in the Caymans. As the Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker <a href=""http://foreignlobbying.org/client/Cayman%20Islands%20Government%2C%20Portfolio%20of%20Finance%20and%20Economics/"">shows</a>, they also touted Cayman Islands participation in trade information exchange agreements, its OECD status, and its efforts at transparency.

Fleishman-Hillard also prepped their client for a March 2008 visit from the Government Accountability Office (the findings from that visit are in this <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08778.pdf"">report</a> that noted praise for the Caymans' legal system and ""strong culture of compliance"" but also noted that the jurisdiction's bank secrecy created problems for U.S. investigative and enforcement efforts. The report also noted that partners of Maples and Calder said that U.S. taxpayers bear ultimate responsibility for compliance with U.S. tax laws.

Fleishman-Hillard offered advice to the Caymans government on how to respond to a <a href=""http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E5DF1038F932A25750C0A96E9C8B63"">critical letter to the editor</a> in the New York Times by Robert Morgenthau, then the district attorney of the county of New York and introduced government officials to U.S. financial industry trade groups to search for common lobbying interests.

But the disclosures also show that Ugland House kept rearing its head. As early as December 2007, Fleishman-Hillard lobbyists sent information to an aide in Obama's Senate office about the building and its occupant.

In January 2008, when Obama repeated the line about Ugland House in a presidential campaign forum in Manchester, N.H., Fleishman-Hillard lobbyists forwarded the transcript to their client. Two days later, Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, also disparaged the Caymans at a Republican presidential event. He said that tax cheats ""can hide [income] away in a Cayman Island offshore bank account and pay no tax on it."" Two weeks later, Fleishman-Hillard forwarded all the presidential candidates information on the Caymans.

A <a href=""http://www.fara.gov/docs/5801-Supplemental-Statement-20090619-4.pdf"">filing</a> from 2009, not yet in Foreign Influence Lobbying Tracker, shows that representatives of Fleishman-Hillard approached members of the Obama campaign after a pre-election rally in November, to advise them on ""facts concerning Ugland House and Cayman Islands financial services.""

When Obama repeated his stump speech line, he set off a small protest from interests in the Cayman Islands. Anthony Travers, chairman of the Cayman Islands Financial Services Association <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS226631+05-May-2009+PRN20090505"">responded</a> with an open letter, disputing the notion that foreign businesses operating in his jurisdiction are doing anything illegal.

And the <em>Spectator</em> <a href=""http://www.spectator.co.uk/business/coffeehouse/3615463/the-tax-havens-fight-back.thtml"">reported</a> that someone from the Caymans had sent out a press release noting that the in Vice President Joe Biden's home state of Delaware is a building that has, not 12,000 companies, but 217,000 claiming it as an address.

Bravakis said the government hadn't sent the press release. Whoever did could have found the comparison of Ugland House to the Wilmington, Del., firm in filings made by Fleishman-Hillard.

So let's look at the $141,000 that the <a href=""http://www.asms.net/"">Alabama School of Math and Science</a> in Mobile, Ala., got in the <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-3043"">Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Act</a>.

The school--a public, residential school for sophomores through seniors who are gifted in science and math--employed Capitol Link, a lobbying firm, from <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/lobbyists/clientsum.asp?year=2004&amp;txtname=Alabama+School+of+Mathematics+%26+Science"">2004</a> through <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/lobbyists/clientsum.asp?year=2007&amp;txtname=Alabama+School+of+Mathematics+%26+Science"">2007</a>. During that time, there was no six-month period in which the school paid the firm more than $10,000, so it's impossible to tell from the disclosures how much the school spent on lobbying. It is possible to say that the firm lobbied on H.R. 3043 -- the Labor, HHS, Education appropriations -- by clicking to page two of <a href=""http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=18995BD2-944D-42C6-83D5-45F4D36CEBEF"">this disclosure form</a>.

Hopping over to <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/indivs/index.asp"">OpenSecrets.org's donor lookup</a> page, I found no contributions from employees who listed their employer as the Alabama School of Math and Science. Running ""Capitol Link"" in the occupation box, however, turns up $7,700 in contributions from David Staton, the Capitol Link lobbyist and <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.asp?id=12374"">former member of Congress</a> who represented the Alabama School of Math and Science, and Lynn Staton, over a period starting on June 20, 2002, through December 31, 2007. 

Again, not a staggering amount of money, but that's two earmarks that went to clients of lobbyists who'd contributed to Bonner's campaigns.

1556	Open Notebook: Tax Havens	open-notebook-tax-havens	2	"Just a few odds, ends and bits of reporting that didn't make it into <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/08/20/raising-ugland-house-cayman-islands-lobbies-to-keep-haven-safe/"">this post</a> that relies on data from the <a href=""http://www.foreignlobbying.org"">Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker</a> that we collaborated on  with our friends from <a href=""http://www.propublica.org"">ProPublica</a>:

<strong>Numbers</strong>: I really hesitated to use the <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-By-The-President-On-International-Tax-Policy-Reform/"">administration's claims</a> of $210 billion in tax revenue raised (there's a fairly good breakdown of which proposals raise what part of the $210 billion in the New York Times <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/business/05tax.html"">here</a>). Tax havens offer secrecy, so even if the government knows how much money they hold (I doubt that it does) it can't determine who owns it. Plus, as Andy Quinlan of the <a href=""http://freedomandprosperity.org/"">Center for Freedom and Prosperity</a> pointed out, lots of the numbers on tax havens <a href=""http://www.freedomandprosperity.org/Papers/blum-crs-ltr.pdf"">are squishy</a>, as the linked Congressional Research Service document shows (it's short--just one page--with no higher math! It also says a lot about the uncertainties of estimating revenues from offshore tax revenues).

<b>The <i>real</i> money in politics</b>: Whether we're talking about extending health benefits to the uninsured, cap and trade, or the <a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/105xx/doc10521/2009BudgetUpdate_Summary.pdf"">deficit spending</a> in general, tax revenue (or lack thereof) forms a major part of the discussion (as it does in the long range problems forecast for Medicare and Social Security). There are <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/07/10/house.health.care.tax/index.html"">exceptions</a>, obviously, but not many politicians seem interested in talking about additional taxes to pay for new spending. 

<strong>Obama's tax proposals</strong>: The administration's <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/LEVELING-THE-PLAYING-FIELD-CURBING-TAX-HAVENS-AND-REMOVING-TAX-INCENTIVES-FOR-SHIFTING-JOBS-OVERSEAS/"">reforms</a> seem to be mostly directed at U.S. corporations and individuals, and not necessarily at tax havens (there is a provision that would require <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/businesses/international/article/0,,id=102314,00.html"">Qualified Intermediaries</a> -- foreign institutions or foreign branches of U.S. institutions -- to ""share as much information about their U.S. customers as U.S. financial institutions do""). It's much easier to change the rules for U.S. taxpayers (corporations and individuals) and foreign private entities than it is to change the rules for sovereign nations. (See below.)

<strong><a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s506/show"">Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act</a></strong>: This bill could in effect bar entities within jurisdictions labeled as tax havens by the Treasury Secretary from doing business with the United States. It has all of five cosponsors in the Senate, and a more respectable 65 cosponsors in the <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h1265/show"">House</a>. Neither bill has made it out of committee. 

<strong>Foreign lobbyists as diplomats</strong>: The data in <a href=""http://www.foreignlobbying.org"">Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker</a> made us think that a lot of smaller countries used lobbyists to supplement or in lieu of traditional diplomats. Ted Bravakis, the public affairs officer for the Cayman Islands Ministry of Financial Services, offered some confirmation for that theory: ""The Cayman Islands, as a UK Overseas Territory, approaches international relations similar to a private sector organisation.  This means we take a very 'hands on' approach -- rather than relying on a diplomatic corps which is not afforded to us -- to build and reinforce relationships with foreign countries.  This is especially the case with the U.S. government, as we continually seek to reinforce our ties in relation to the Cayman Islands financial services sector and the long-standing commercial relationship between the U.S. and the Cayman Islands.""

<strong>Revolver at Fleishman-Hillard</strong>: The key lobbyist for the Cayman Islands was former Texas Rep. <a href=""http://209.11.109.152/pls/htmldb/f?p=171:200:283537023250306::NO:RP,200:P200_REG_NUMBER,P200_DOC_TYPE:5801%2CShort-Form"">Max Sandlin</a>, who served in Congress from 1997 to 2005. He was on the Ways and Means Committee and in the House Democratic leadership -- his bio is <a href=""http://www.igr-group.com/go.cfm?do=Page.Show&amp;pid=4"">here</a>.

<b>On the OECD effort</b>: Found a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Havens-Storm-Struggle-Regulation-Political/dp/0801445043/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1252084534&sr=8-1"">great book</a> on something I followed pretty closely at the time it was going on: the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's effort in the late '90s--early aughts to isolate countries that engaged in ""harmful tax competition."" <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Havens-Storm-Struggle-Regulation-Political/dp/0801445043/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1252084534&sr=8-1"">Havens in a Storm: The Struggle for Global Tax Regulation</a>, by J.C. Sharman, recounts that effort, what was behind it, and why it failed. Sharman did a lot of field work, and comes to some interesting conclusions, among them: that corporations that benefit from the use of offshore tax havens were not at all involved in the effort against the OECD, either domestically (the U.S. pulled out of the effort in 2001) or internationally (he contrasts the lack of corporate involvement in the tax haven issue to robust corporate involvement in OECD efforts to regulate e-commerce). 

<b>The power of blacklisting</b>: Sharman argues that the main power of the OECD initiative was its ability to label tax havens as bad actors, making them potentially less attractive destinations for capital: ""...once jurisdictions were blacklisted, their reputations were changed. They were left vulnerable to capital flight because third party investors were more likely to either avoid or withdraw from listed states."" <a href=""http://foreignlobbying.org/issue_search/?query=blacklist"">Blacklist</a> turns up in the Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker as an issue of concern.

<b>Inconsistencies</b>: Sharman also points out many internal problems with the OECD initiative--not the least of which was omitting from its list of harmful tax competitors Switzerland and Luxembourg, both of which are OECD members. Rich tax havens in Europe were let off the hook, while poorer tax havens in the Caribbean, Central America, the South Pacific and Africa were blacklisted. 

<b>The role of ideology</b>: Sharman mainly credits the <a href=""http://freedomandprosperity.org/"">Center for Freedom and Prosperity</a> for turning back the OECD effort, with an assist from the havens themselves (although it's also worth noting that there was no unified response from tax havens: The Cayman Islands very quickly got on board with OECD effort, for example, while Barbados held out--despite its financial services industry's preference for cooperation with the OECD). Andrew Quinlan, Dan Mitchell and Veronique de Rugy played the pivotal role in redefining the argument from ""harmful tax competition"" to ""global tax regulation,"" arguing that the OECD was attempting to impose some of its members' preferences for high taxes on the rest of the world. Sovereignty became the issue, rather than the OECD's preferred narrative of a harmful ""rush to the bottom"" caused by tax competition. One thing Sharman doesn't get into enough--Quinlan, Mitchell and de Rugy had much easier going with a Republican Congress and the Bush administration. 

<b>Current scene</b>: With a Democratic Congress and the Obama administration, it would seem that tax havens might have less room to maneuver, and the Center for Freedom and Prosperity--which is lobbying on several fronts, and having multiple meetings on the Hill with members to oppose the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act--would find less sympathetic ears. Quinlan told me that ""there's not much of a lobbying effort by the countries themselves,"" and that, in the current climate havens ""are willing to go along to get along and do whatever they can to survive."" I have to admit, I was skeptical when Quinlan told me that ""it's not like the British Virgin Islands or Antigua can afford to pay a $50,000 a month retainer to a Washington representative,"" since we were seeing payments higher than that from some (but not all) tax havens, but now I see, via <a href=""http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/84503/"">InstaPundit</a>, that the Cayman Islands <a href=""http://caymannetnews.com/breaknews-18000--1-1---.html"">have their own budget crisis</a>. They might have to raise taxes...

Obviously, the 28 occasions we tallied of Rangel omitting information from his financial disclosures is inaccurate--it's too low. The Pepisco Stock, the land in Glassboro, N.J. and the Yum!

1567	"""Man without a country"" peddles international influence through tangled ties"	man-without-a-country-peddles-international-influence-through-tangled-ties	2	"None of the former officials who have signed up to lobby the U.S. government for foreign interests--a list that includes presidential nominees (Bob Dole) and congressional leaders (Richard Gephardt, Dick Armey)--has a resume as offbeat as that of Ari Ben-Menashe. Ben-Menashe's government service came as  former Israeli spy, he once tried to implicate the president of Zimbabwe's opposition in an assassination attempt and he boasted of being a ""man without a country"" in a tell all book about his life as a spy. He also had one of the richest contracts to lobby for a foreign client--though he apparently had no contacts with U.S. government officials whatsoever.

According to data in the <a href=""http://www.foreignlobbying.org"">Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker</a>, Paul Calder LeRoux, a 35-year-old citizen of Australia and South Africa, hired the spy-turned-political consultant who now operates out of Canada, and <a href=""http://foreignlobbying.org/client/Paul%20Calder%20LeRoux/"">paid him</a> more than $6.5 million in 2007 and 2008. Dickens and Madson Canada, the firm that employs Ben-Menashe, disclosed that LeRoux hired them to facilitate an overseas real estate deal, in this case for vast swaths of farmland in Zimbabwe. 

As is often the case with those who hire lobbyists, LeRoux was essentially paying for access--in this case to the controversial president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, whose government <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/africa/03/30/zimbabwe.farmers/index.html"">seized</a> white-owned farms, a <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7906031.stm"">practice</a> that <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/809327.stm"">has continued</a> even after Mugabe was forced to share power with opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai following a disputed election in 2008.  

""I happen to know people,"" Ben-Menashe said.

It's not unusual for lobbyists to make that claim, but few backroom deals in Washington can compare to the intrigues that the former spy was involved in.

<b>Cloak and dagger</b>

In 1989 Ben-Menashe was arrested near Los Angeles for allegedly smuggling Lockheed planes into Iran, but was acquitted after testifying that the deal had been approved by the United States and Israel. Israel refused to let him re-enter his country after the trial, however, because of his testimony, he said.

In 1991, Ben-Menashe  alleged that Robert Gates, then in the process of being confirmed to head the CIA, was involved in selling weapons to Iraq during the Iraq-Iran war. The Senate Intelligence Committee considered the allegations, but in the end did not give them credence.

That same year, the former spy claimed to have witnessed Republicans, including vice presidential candidate George H.W. Bush, meet with Iranian officials in 1980 to arrange for the American hostages in Iran to be held until after Jimmy Carter had left office.

In 1992, he authored a book,  ""Profits of War: Inside the Secret US-Israeli Arms Network,"" that reprised some of the charges he made against Gates and the elder Bush. ""Since 1990 he has been a man without a country, dividing his time between England, the United States and Australia,"" the dust jacket says of the book's author. ""He cannot for obvious reasons return to Israel."" 

The man without a country then moved to Canada and married a woman there, thereby gaining citizenship (they later divorced), and set up an export business that ran into trouble of its own.

Customers complained that goods never arrived after his firm had received money; more seriously, in October 2008 <span><span>Alexander Legault</span></span>--his partner in the export business and at Dickens and Madson as well--was deported to the United States. 

In July 2009, Legault plead guilty in a Louisiana court to decades-old allegations that he defrauded the Egyptian government of $7 million. Prosecutors said the country wired him the money in exchange for a shipment of frozen chicken, and Legault transferred some of the money to a bank account in the Cayman Islands and sent forged paperwork indicating the chickens were aboard a Swedish ship. 

<b>A player in Zimbabwe</b>

Lobbyists often involve themselves in political campaigns, but Ben-Menashe's role in Zimbabwe's disputed 2002 presidential election went far beyond bundling contributions or serving as a strategic adviser. 

Mugabe defeated Tsvangirai by the narrowest of margins in what was widely decried as a rigged election. At the time, Tsvangirai spoke with Ben-Menashe about a plan to ""eliminate"" Mugabe. Ben-Menashe turned over a videotape of the conversation to Mugabe's administration, and Tsvangirai was charged with treason.

Tsvangiria claimed he was approached by Ben-Menashe, but in an interview, the Montreal-based lobbyist said it was the other way around. ""The head of the opposition of the government you're representing says, 'Can you help us do a coup and kill the guy?'""

Tsvangiria was acquited in 2004 when it became clear that he may have been asking for Ben-Menashe's help as a political consultant--not an assassin--and after Ben-Menashe made an impression on the court as an unreliable witness trying to manipulate politicians' public images.

In a statement, Tsvangiria said the two met four times. ""At the fourth meeting, Mr. Menashe kept on deviating from the issues discussed previously. He and his team raised the issue of elimination and kept on asking strange questions. It was this stage that I became suspicious of the motives of the Dickens and Madson representatives and walked out of the meeting.""

Even as Dickens and Madson appeared to court Tsvangiria, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, it was working on  behalf of Mugabe's government. A list of press releases it put out that election season includes headlines like ""MDC demands that polls stay open until they win"" and ""MDC leaders head for the hills."" 

Tsvangirai appeared to defeat Mugabe in the 2008 rematch, but an insufficiently large plurality triggered a runoff election that degenerated into violence. Mugabe was sworn in again, but faced sanctions from the United States and European governments. Pressured at home and abroad, Mugabe agreed to a power sharing agreement brokered shortly thereafter. Tsvangirai was sworn in as prime minister, with Mugabe retaining the title of president.

Between January 2007 and January 2009, Paul Calder LeRoux, a wealthy white man born in Zimbabwe, transferred to Dickens and Madson nearly $13 million, with the stated purpose being to ""generate policies favorable to [his] business interests,"" FARA forms show. The firm never reported actually making contacts with Congress or the White House, and it's unclear how those bodies could influence the land deal.

""In this case we had nothing to do with the US. Sometimes we register just as a caution,"" Ben-Menashe said.

LeRoux sought to acquire 99-year leases on farmland, which was taken from whites and distributed to blacks early in Mugabe's regime. LeRoux could not be reached for comment.

Registration forms show that in the past, in addition to the government of Zimbabwe, Ben-Menashe has represented Ghana and Vanuatu, a South Pacific island nation.

ButÂ  the political consultant's worldwide connections don't end there, and he seems perpetually in search of new adventure.

""Right now we're doing work on the other side of the world, in Russia,"" he said. ""The U.S. isn't the only place people want to talk to."""		2009-08-26 17:00:36	2009-08-26 17:00:36	2009-08-26 17:00:36	1	0	1

1586	How well do popular drugs work?	how-well-do-popular-drugs-work	26	"Here at Real Time we are beginning to dig into examples of secret data--data the government collects, that could affect our health and safety, but we, the public, can't see.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a treasure house of data on the safety and efficacy of prescription drugs. Before a drug company can market a product in this country, it must first submit a plan to test the drug. Agency scientists review and analyze the results once they are submitted. Yet it's not always easy to get your hands on this information.

""One major problem is that FDA reviews are electronically available only for drugs approved since 1997,"" wrote Dr. Erick H. Turner, a FDA drug reviewer turned transparency evangelist,<a href=""http://www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/home.html#documentDetail?R=09000064809e5698""> in recent submitted testimony</a> to the FDA's transparency task force. ""A researcher interested in a drug approved in, say, 1995, must file a â€œpaper FOIAâ€ request and wait perhaps several years to have it fulfilled.""

These ""old"" data can provide crucial insights. Dr. Turner, who is now on faculty in the Department of Psychiatry at Oregon Health &amp; Science University, and colleagues published a much noted study last year in the <a href=""http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/358/3/252"">New England Journal of Medicine</a>, where they showed that several commonly prescribed anti-depressants don't work as well as the literature published in major medical journals suggests.

They found that in peer-reviewed literature, antidepressant drugs beat placebos in nearly 100% of clinical trials. However, when FDA documents for particular drugs were analyzed--several of which were approved before 1997 and had to be collected via the Freedom of Information Act--only half of the trials were positive. ""This discrepancy was due to a combination of nonpublication and,"" wrote Turner, ""for lack of a better word, â€œspinâ€.""

Turner also noted even for drugs approved more recently, ""coverage is spotty."" There are, for example, a certain set of drugs first approved for treatment of schizophrenia and later for bipolar mania. While the schizophrenia reviews are available online, none of the mania reviews are posted. Also, when a drug is widely prescribed for off-label use, but the FDA has rejected this usage do to safety or efficacy concerns, that analysis is ""currently kept secret from healthcare providers and their patients.""

Turner also noted that even when FDA review documents are posted online, they are ""posted in a user-unfriendly fashion."" While they make their way through the agency review process, agency scientists can easily navigate electronic documents via hyperlinks. But, when a FOIA request is submitted, then agency staff print out the documents, physically redact certain information, and then create a new PDF, which is then not easily searchable."		2009-08-27 15:27:07	2009-08-27 15:27:07	2009-08-27 15:27:07	1	0	1
16	SF-LLL Timeline: Part 1 (1989)	sf-lll-timeline-part-1-1989	2	"The timeline for form SF-LLL that I <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2007/04/02/timeline-time/"">foolishly promised</a> the other day has grown to an alarming length. I'm posting the pre-SF-LLL history now--the events that led Congress to pass and the President to sign a bill requiring those seeking federal contracts or grants to file a disclosure form whenever they pay a lobbyist ito influence members of Congress or the executive branch in obtaining those contracts or grants. So here's a very brief accounting of the relevant events from 1989:

<blockquote><b>June 1989: </b>Context is important. In 1989, <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958028-1,00.html"">a scandal</a> unfolded that involved former Reagan Administration officials successfully lobbying the <a href=""http://www.hud.gov"">Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> to secure HUD funds for their clients (including some big campaign contributors) in exchange for hefty consulting fees (skimmed off the top of those HUD funds). Federal dollars intended to provide affordable housing for low income Americans instead is ending up in the pockets of the likes of <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958215,00.html"">James Watt</a>, the former Interior secretary. Just as Congress was rightly getting into high dudgeon over the ability of lobbyists to earn six figure sums by getting taxpayer money from the executive branch, the Washington Post published a <a href=""http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/interactives/citizenkstreet/documents/WaPo_Dan_Morgan_89.pdf"">story</a> by reporter Dan Morgan on June 18 that showed that lobbyists were making as much of $50,000 a month per client by getting tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money from the congressional appropriations committees, while also helping to raise campaign contributions for the members of Congress who sat on those committees. As the Washington Post's Robert G. Kaiser <a href=""http://blog.washingtonpost.com/citizen-k-street/chapters/chapter_10/"">recounts</a> in his excellent online series <a href=""http://blog.washingtonpost.com/citizen-k-street/"">Citizen K Street</a>, this irritates Sen. Robert Byrd; it appears that, like HUD, the Senate Appropriations Committee (which Byrd chairs) is handing out federal favors to insiders, if I'm reading Kaiser correctly. 

<b>July 25, 1989:</b> The Senate Appropriations Committee sends the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act to the full Senate for consideration. Within the bill is something known as the Byrd Amendment--which blocks government contractors and grantees for paying for lobbyists with federal funds and requires greater disclosure from lobbyists seeking to influence members of Congress or executive branch officials when seeking government contracts or grants for their clients. (Thanks to the vagaries of <a href=""http://thomas.loc.gov"">Thomas</a>, I can't link directly to the information, but if you search the 101st Congress for H.R. 2788, you can find much of this information for yourself.)

<b>July 26, 1989:</b> The Senate passes the Interior Appropriations bill, with the Byrd Amendment intact. At the time, the Post described it thusly: 

<blockquote>The Senate Wednesday passed a Byrd-sponsored amendment that would require persons or organizations receiving federal contracts, grants, loans or guarantees to report to government agencies the names of consultants and lobbyists who help them. Grantees also would have to say how much the consultants were paid, report the source of the funds and describe the activities covered.

Current laws require registration by lobbyists who have an interest in pending legislation. Byrd's amendment applies to anyone influencing or attempting to influence congressional staff members or executive branch officials, and would forbid use of federal funds to pay for such activities. The information required under Byrd's legislation would be centrally available to the public and Congress, at the offices of the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House.</blockquote>

<b>July 31, 1989:</b> The Washington Post publishes a story, also by Dan Morgan, saying that Byrd has decided to block the earmark tha West Virginia Universtiy sought. 

<b>Aug. 20, 1989:</b> The St. Petersburg Times publishes an op-ed by Byrd, discussing his legislation. Byrd writes,

<blockquote>Whether justified or not, the perception is growing that the merit of any project, grant, or contract awarded by the government has fallen into a distant second place to the moxie and clout of lobbyists who help spring the money out of appropriation bills for a fat fee. As the new chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have become concerned not only by the perception, but also by the possibility, that this practice could become widespread.</blockquote>

<b>Sept. 13, 1989:</b> The House votes in favor of the Byrd Amendment.

<b>Oct. 3 and 7, 1989:</b> On the first date, the House approves the Interior appropriations bill, on the latter, the Senate does the same. The Byrd Amendment survived the Conference Committee process.

<b>Oct. 23, 1989:</b> President Bush signs the measure into law -- P.L. 101-121, if you're keeping score at home. The Byrd Amendment is Section 319 of the act. (If you're so inclined, you can download Section 319 as a Word Document by clicking <a href=""http://www.dotdom2.state.pa.us/ECMS/Ecms_File_Cabinet.nsf/$vwFiles/PublicLaw101-121,Section31906212002/$File/Public%20Law%20101%20to%20121,Section%20319.doc"">here</a>.

<b>Dec. 23, 1989:</b> The Byrd Amendment takes effect. However, as we'll see in the soon-to-be posted 1990 timeline, there's no means yet established for complying with it.

<a href=""http://sunshine.gop.gov"">Sunshine.gop.gov</a>, a new House Republican site, houses a machine-readable version of the database, but the site does not allow viewers to obtain all earmarks at a glance, instead forcing them to search for terms or browse a few at a time and making analysis impossible.

By writing a computer program to automatically access the site thousands of times, the Sunlight Foundation culled the 20,000 line-items into a file usable for mining for tidbits.

Although most earmarks are special directions from particular lawmakers to an entity in his or her district, the database also includes some defense requests and other projects that, while requested by particular lawmakers, don't directly benefit the district. Because those requests can be disproportionately large, it wouldn't be fair to use these numbers to determine who sought the most pork.

In addition, these are requestsâ€”not approved earmarksâ€”so they don't represent money that's already been spent, only indicate that steps were taken to secure funds. Still, it can be interesting to see which projects made lawmakers' cuts.

A sample of the database:
<ul>
	<li>Three million dollars for a proposed recreation center in Ohio named after Representative Stephanie Tubbs-Jones, who passed away last year while in office, requested by Ohio Reps. Dennis Kucinich and Marcia Fudge. Earmarks for projects named after (living) lawmakersâ€”specifically those requesting the fundsâ€”have been a sensitive subject on the Hill in the past. New York rep Charles Rangel faced an ethics inquiry in part due to a college building named after him. Maxine Waters and appropriations chairman Dave Obey got into an unusually testy argument, <a href=""http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/obey-waters-in-noisy-floor-fight-2009-06-25.html"">the Hill reported</a>, when Obey became incensed at Waters' insistence on an earmark for a training center previously named after her.</li>
	<li>Nearly $19 million in funding for ethanol plants, despite the fact that many facilities are now sitting empty, suffering from failed business models and a growing skepticism of the technology's potential. Heavily-subsidized corn ethanol mandates are set to shrink, and second-generation â€œcellulosicâ€ ethanol has so far failed to scale to production levels. Forty-eight requests totaling $70 million contain the words bio fuel, biomass or ethanol, including requests for advanced technologies such as those that would use algae to produce fuel.</li>
	<li>The perhaps unfortunately-named â€œBridge to ER One.â€ While the project is designed to bolster safety in downtown Washington, DC in case of an emergency, it invokes perhaps the most infamous earmark request of all time, that for an isolatedâ€”but expensive--â€bridge to nowhereâ€ in Alaska.</li>

Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., joined Bonner in sponsoring the earmark in the Commerce, Justice and Science appropriations bill. Team Focus got another earmark in the same bill for $517,000--this one sponsored by Sens. Shelby and Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and joined by Bonner. The first earmark is for mentoring and education, while the second is for youth education and mentoring. (This information comes from <a href=""http://www.taxpayer.net"">Taxpayers for Common Sense</a>, something I haven't pointed out as I should.)

Patton Boggs, one of the bigger Washington lobbying firms, <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/clientsum.asp?txtname=Team+Focus&amp;year=2007"">lobbies</a> for Team Focus; a quick check of <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org"">Open Secrets</a> shows just $550 in contributions to Bonner from employees of the firm--all in 2002.

I looked up Team Focus' 990s on <a href=""http://www.guidestar.org"">Guidestar</a> to get a list of directors and executives to see if any of them had contributed to Bonner's campaign (there was one match, for $500, in 2007, from Michael Gottfried, the organization's founder and CEO) and came across this reference to Patton Boggs (click on the image to see it larger, click again to see it full-size):

(Again, click the image to see it larger). ""Seek federal funding"" is pretty close to fundraising.

FY 2008 Commerce/Justice/Science Appropriations.""

Now, here's a cautionary tale about why you should always cross reference documents whenever possible. Team Focus' 990s don't disclose spending any money on federal lobbyists. Here's the relevant section from their 2007 IRS filing:

I called Team Focus, and talked to Cathy Nabors, their executive assistant, who seemed genuinely surprised that their man at Patton Boggs, Thomas C. Downs, had done any lobbying. Brandy Morgan, who works at Hieronymous, Gaillard &amp; Jones LLC, the accounting firm that prepared the 990 for Team Focus, echoed that reaction, and said that the she understood from Nabors that Downs was helping prepare paperwork in connection with some federal grant applications (which would not be lobbying).

Some idle speculation: It's entirely possible that Downs filed the lobbying disclosures out of an excess of caution even though he didn't actually lobby (although the disclosures say that he contacted the House and Senate--worth noting that he <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.asp?id=13289"">turns up</a> in Open Secrets' <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/revolving/index.asp#search.asp?sch=P"">Revolving Door</a> database as a former congressional staffer); it's also possible that there was a simple miscommunication somewhere along the line.

I called Downs and left a message for him.

By the way, and just to be clear -- this was just an oddity I ran across with conflicting documents. One set is most likely inaccurate, and I'm just curious to find out which one."		2008-02-28 03:56:44	2008-02-28 03:59:53	2008-02-28 03:56:44	1	0	1
1619	Informant in tiny nation toppled decades of banking secrecy	informant-in-tiny-nation-toppled-decades-of-banking-secrecy	27	"Swiss mega-bank UBS has dominated recent headlines with its reluctant release of a subset of the list of Americans using the accounts, long shrouded in secrecy, to avoid paying taxes to the US.

But it was an obscure microstate that set off the banking-secrecy firestorm last year when other nations obtained evidence that hundreds of its citizens were sidestepping billions of dollars in taxes by hiding money in secret accounts there.

The probe into anonymous bank accounts began in the tiny German-speaking nation of Liechtenstein, when an employee of the LGT Group bank<span style=""color: #000080;"">,</span> which is owned by the country's royal family, sold a compact disc containing information on foreign account holders to authorities in Germany, and then Britain and the US.

Heinrich Kieber, the IT staffer tasked with digitizing paper records who got rich by turning over the documents implicating wealthy tax-avoiders, is now <a href=""http://www.interpol.int/public/Data/Wanted/Notices/Data/1997/70/1997_24270.asp"" target=""_blank"">wanted</a> by Interpol, but German authorities have reportedly given a new identity to the balding 44-year old who now has the means to live comfortably, yet is despised by untold numbers of powerful men across the globe.

Outrage at the massive scale of the tax avoidance he saw during the course of his employment led him to leak the data, Kieber claimed in a video testimony shown in a July 2008 hearing of a Senate investigations subcommittee. The subcommittee, chaired by Carl Levin (D-Mich.), released a report targeting LGT and the Swiss bank UBS, and estimated that $100 billion in tax revenue was lost to tax havens each year.

By that time, the Liechtenstein government had mounted a <a href=""http://foreignlobbying.org/client/Government%20of%20the%20Principality%20of%20Liechtenstein/"">blitzkrieg lobbying effort</a>, making contact with members of the US government and media 128 times in June and July, ranking it ahead of Germany for the year. In all, it spent $177,000 on lobbying. They <a href=""http://www.fara.gov/docs/5815-Exhibit-AB-20070622-1.pdf"" target=""_blank"">registered</a> for the first time under FARA in June 2006.

Within weeks, lobbyists contacted nearly one-fourth of the United States senators' offices, strategically targeting 18 out of 21 senators who sat on the Committee on Finance, and met in person with professional staff from the Senate committees on Finance and Homeland Security, the Joint Committee on Taxation, and officials from the IRS and the departments of State, Treasury and Justice.

Caplin &amp; Drysdale, a law firm specializing in tax law which is providing legal counsel to some 200 Americans worried about their offshore accounts, mostly in Switzerland, represented the Liechtenstein government in negotiating an agreement with the Treasury Department.

Lobbyists from Covington &amp; Burling tackled relations on the Hill, where a crew including former Congressman Michael Barnes were met with a cool reception from lawmakers universally wary of tax havens.

Separately, LGT Bank retained lobbyists from Levick Strategic Communications for $70,000 in 2008.

Kieber shopped the data to several countries, including the U.S. and Britain, but when Britain's payments were slow to arrive, he met clandestinely with German agents who by 2006 agreed to purchase--for the equivalent of more than six million dollars--discs containing info on some 1,400 German-linked accounts.

German politicians berated the tax haven for its secrecy while launching investigations that were sure to target some of its own elites. Meanwhile, Liechtenstein took umbrage at the use of stolen data, and its ruling family recalled artwork it owned from a German museum display.

It was not the informant's first taste of international intrigue.

Kieber had for years been wanted in Spain for a 1996 real-estate scam, but he fled to Argentina, where he later claimed to German investigators that he had been kidnapped and tortured.

After returning to Liechtenstein, attaining employment at the bank and stealing the records, he tried to blackmail the ruling family via letter by threatening to release the data unless he was granted a new identity, which could help him elude punishment in Spain. The royal family refused, but he nevertheless turned himself in, and received probation from Spanish authorities. In 2004 Liechtenstein closed its data-theft case on Kieber, convinced he was no longer a threat, the German <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,537640,00.html"">Der Spiegel reported</a>.

Last December, Liechtenstein signed a <a href=""http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/us%20liechtenstein%20tiea.pdf"">Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the US</a>, under which the US can obtain information on bank accounts held there for tax investigations from 2009 onward.

Liechtenstein was basically prepared to enter into an agreement along the lines sought by the United States, said Caplin &amp; Drysdale lawyer H. David Rosenbloom, who decades ago worked for the Treasury, specializing in international tax law.

The country seemed more ready to forego its secrecy than the much larger Switzerland. But the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international body that sets standards for information sharing and monitors tax havens, classifies Liechtenstein among nations that ""have committed to the internationally agreed tax standard, but have not yet substantially implemented"" it.

<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125132884336262013.html?mod=wsjcrmain"">Weeks ago</a>, Britain agreed to grant significant leniency to citizens who admit to holding Liechtenstein accounts and who pay back taxes.

In the last couple weeks, UBS began turning over data on some 4,500 citizens holding perhaps $18 billion in Swiss bank accounts. That's less than a tenth of the names the US reportedly sought, but it marks a retreat from the bank's original stance that it would be violating its country's laws by disclosing the information.

The IRS allows for voluntary disclosure, in which Americans who admit to failing to report assets abroad can amend tax returns and pay penalties, likely avoiding prosecution.

As for those who don't, whether they are actually prosecuted depends on lots of factors, including the amounts at issue, how and why income was omitted, whether steps were taken to obscure the receipt of the income, Rosenbloom said.

OECD convenes Tuesday in Mexico to discuss steps for dealing with tax havens moving forward."		2009-08-31 12:35:53	2009-08-31 12:35:53	2009-08-31 12:35:53	1	0	1

The government of <st1:country-region w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region> raised objections to Section 1083 of the bill, which Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºstrengthened the ability of victims of the brutality of Saddam Hussein to seek compensation,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ according to a <a href=""http://speaker.gov/newsroom/pressreleases?id=0477"">statement</a> put out by the SpeakerÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s office.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Maggs &amp; McDermott doesnÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´t even have its own Web site, but in an e-mail exchange Mills wrote that the firmÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s areas of operations included, Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºforeign sovereign defense of claims made in <st1:country-region w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> courts by private plaintiffs; international disputes; public contract law disputes and Privacy Act litigation.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ The e-mail also said that Mills had represented the Government of Iraq in <a href=""http://travel.state.gov/law/info/judicial/judicial_693.html"">Foreign Sovereign Immunities</a> litigation since June 2004.

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Before working with Maggs &amp; McDermott, Mills was a partner at the prominent Washington, D.C. lobbying firm, Patton Boggs. According to court documents, Mills has been lead counsel or co-counsel on at least three civil litigation cases since 2002 filed with federal courts in Washington, D.C. Mills is also the President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Iraq and was on the team of counsel representing the Bush-Cheney campaign during the 2000 Florida recount, according to <a href=""http://www.rnla.org/bio/BioDetail.asp?MemberID=277"">this</a> profile on the Republican National lawyers Association website.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span> </span></p>

Turkey mounted the largest foreign lobbying effort of 2008 in order to deter the U.S. Congress from declaring events in that part of the world 85 years prior as a genocide. The lobbying onslaught <a href=""https://www.propublica.org/feature/opening-the-window-on-foreign-lobbying-718"">appeared to have worked</a>, we've written on our <a href=""http://www.foreignlobbying.org"">Foreign Lobbyist Influence Tracker</a>, but under an agreement floated this week, the <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125181063745875977.html#mod=todays_us_page_one"">Wall Street Journal reports today</a>, the countries have taken steps to open relations while agreeing to mount a joint historical investigation into the deaths, which numbered as high as 1.5 million.

As a senator, Barack Obama supported terming the Turks' ancestors' actions genocide, but in an April visit to Turkey the president steered clear of the topic.

Lobbyists for Turkey made 2,268 contacts with Congressional offices in a short period, <a href=""http://www.propublica.org/feature/adding-it-up-the-top-players-in-foreign-agent-lobbying-718"">we've reported</a>, more than any other country. Armenia has a presence on Capitol Hill as well, and there was <a href=""http://www.aaainc.org/index.php?id=114"">pushback</a> from that camp.

<blockquote>...only visits after Sept. 15, 2009, will be revealed. The first wave of records is expected to be posted around Dec. 31.

...msnbc.com had sought records on all White House visitors. That request, for all visitors since Inauguration Day, still stands, and msnbc.com has filed an administrative appeal with the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Secret Service.

The new White House policy says it will consider requests for visitor information for the period from Jan. 20 to Sept. 15, but only if the requests are narrow and include specific names to be checked. In other words, if you don't know who visited, or can't guess who might have visited during this period, the White House won't tell you.</blockquote>

Dedman also notes that, by labeling these releases ""voluntary,"" the White House still contends that the identities of individuals visiting the White House is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act.

Bushâ€™s. The retroactive disclosures came in response to a lawsuit from <a href=""http://www.citizensforethics.org/node/42296"">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a>, which sought records of meetings with evangelical leaders and Stephen Payne, a lobbyist who allegedly sold a foreign leader access to Cheney in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars in â€œdonationsâ€ to Bushâ€™s presidential library.

<a href=""http://citizensforethics.org/node/42305"">Bushâ€™s</a> <a href=""http://citizensforethics.org/node/42306"">records</a> show that evangelical leader Jerry Falwell, who died in May 2007, was a frequent White House visitor.

The names Lindsey Paola and Elizabeth Sykes also appear.

Nearly the entirety of every page of <a href=""http://citizensforethics.org/node/42307"">Cheneyâ€™s log</a> is blacked out, leaving only two visits from Payne, who also met with Karl Rove.

In July 2008, the Sunday Times <a href=""http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article4322684.ece"">reported</a> that Payne had offered to arrange meetings for an unnamed former official of a central Asian country with top Bush administration officials, including Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Payne asked for between $600,000 and $750,000 in exchange, a third of which would go to the Bush library, with the balance to his lobbying firm, Worldwide Strategic Partners.

The Sunday Times <a href=""http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article4364429.ece"">later reported</a> that Payne may have been paid by foreign officials for setting up other meetings with U.S. officials as early as 2005, including a 2006 trip Cheney took to Kazakhstan, where he met--and praised--Nursultan Nazarbayev, the authoritarian president of the former Soviet republic.

Worldwide Strategic Partners never registered under the <a href=""http://foreignlobbying.org/methodology/"">Foreign Agent Registration Act</a>, which requires firms and individuals that represent foreign governments, political parties, and government-controlled entities to disclose to the U.S. Department of Justice detailed accounts of their interactions with U.S. government officials. Payne was briefly registered as a foreign agent for Pakistan when we worked with a venture called <a href=""http://www.fara.gov/docs/5466-Supplemental-Statement-20020331-GWXZ9E03.pdf"">Team Eagle</a>--he helped broker a lucrative deal for the Islamic Republic in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. Records show that Payne filed short form disclosures--required of all individuals who lobby--in 2001 and again in 2007, but not in 2005 or 2006. 

Payne does not appear in domestic lobbyist disclosure reports--filed with the House and Senate--since 2002, when he was paid $40,000 by SAP America, which lobbied on technology, homeland security and defense issues, and $40,000 by United Space Alliance.

Unlike campaign contributions, donations to presidential libraries are unrestricted in amount, donors do not have to be disclosed, and foreigners may contribute. Such donations arose as an issue during the lead-up to Hillary Clintonâ€™s confirmation as secretary of state, when critics questioned whether foreign donations to her husband, former president Bill Clinton, might compromise her objectivity on international issues."		2009-09-04 22:06:33	2009-09-04 22:06:33	2009-09-04 22:06:33	1	0	1
1649		in-1983-congress-changed-medicare-payment-system-with-little-scrutiny	2	"<a href=""http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/publications/scopenotes/sn4.pdf"">This 1984 paper</a>, which summarizes a number of academic publications that raised questions about a 1983 reform to the Medicare payment system, suggests that whether things have gotten better or worse, they certainly have changed. It's hard to imagine Congress moving so quickly on a health care measure developed behind closed doors.

<blockquote>The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA), signed into law September 3, 1982, mandated the development of a prospective payment methodology for Medicare reimbursement to hospitals. Health and Human Services Secretary, Richard Schweiker, submitted a plan in December 1982 based on administration proposals. Draft legislation was quickly appended to the fast-moving and, highly publicized Social Security Amendments of 1983. Few legislators became actively involved, some commentators feel, because attempts to limit funding rarely become popular issues. As a result, provisions of the legislation were largely designed behind the scenes by legislative aides. The Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health finalized and wrote up the bill in one day, February 24. In April, only four months after initial appearance of a PPS [Prospective Payment System] plan, the Social Security Amendments Act of 1983 (Public Law 98-21) was signed into law, with Title VI containing the new Medicare payment system.</blockquote>

The 1983 act changed Medicare reimbursements from a fee-for-service model to a prospective payment system. The former is pretty much what it sounds like: a hospital charges $30,000 for a hip replacement, and Medicare reimburses it $30,000. In the latter, Medicare devises a schedule -- $15,000 is a fair price for hip replacements -- and hospitals more or less have to like it or lump it (there were exceptions carved out for teaching hospitals, sole community hospitals and other institutions)."		2009-09-08 20:50:57	2009-09-08 20:50:57	2009-09-08 20:50:57	1	0	1
1650	ClinicalTrials.gov missing basic data	clinicaltrials-gov-missing-basic-data	26	"Fewer than half of medical clinical trials published in the last year in leading medical journals are reported on the government site <a href=""clinicaltrials.gov"">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, according to a <a href=""http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/302/9/977?home"">new study</a> published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).

According to the study, despite a 2005 requirement by medical journal editors that researchers register their studies online before acceptance in a major journal, just 147 out of 323 articles published in the past year were properly registered before the end of the trial. To meet the requirement, researchers are supposed to state what outcomes they will measure to figure out trial success.

Even among the articles that were registered, amost a third ""had discrepancies between the outcomes described in the registry and the ones ultimately reported,"" <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/08/health/08aware.html?_r=1"">reports</a> the New York Times. Eighty-nine of the trials were not entered in the <a href=""clinicaltrials.gov"">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> at all.

If researchers don't report what outcomes they are measuring before they publish a final study, they can easily doctor the results for a positive spin. For example, reports the Times, ""a clinical trial is designed to determine whether a drug increases survival rates but investigators change the primary outcome to assessing if the drug improves quality of life.""

This is the perfect case of ""secret"" data--data that technically the government is supposed to have, but is being kept from the public. In this case, the apparent diagnosis is that the requirement for publishing at <a href=""clinicaltrials.gov"">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> is based on a private incentive rather than a straight-out requirement."		2009-09-08 20:35:58	2009-09-08 20:35:58	2009-09-08 20:35:58	1	0	1

<blockquote>In the opening lines of the 48-page opinion, written by Judge Merrick Garland, the court points to a Supreme Court case in 1954 that said the public disclosure of individuals who are trying to influence legislation is ""vital"" national interest.

â€œBecause nothing has transpired in the last half century to suggest that the national interest in public disclosure of lobbying information is any less vital than it was when the Supreme Court first considered the issue, we reject that challenge,â€ Garland wrote in todayâ€™s opinion, which was joined by Judges Douglas Ginsburg and Karen LeCraft Henderson.</blockquote>

At issue was a provision in the <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s1/show"">Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007</a> that requires associations to disclose the identity of anyone paying more than $5,000 a quarter and actively participating in a lobbying campaign. 

This is good as far as it goes, but having spent significant time studying the disclosures made by <a href=""http://www.foreignlobbying.org"">lobbyists for foreign interests</a>, it seems almost quaint that, when it comes to domestic lobbying, listing the names of those paying for the lobbying is in dispute.

Schmidtâ€™s complaint stems from campaign literature in which Krikorian claimed she â€œhas taken $30,000 in blood money from Turkish sponsored political action committees to deny the slaughter of 1.5 million Armenian men, women and children by the Ottoman Turkish government during World War I.""

Though Jean Schmidt doesn't sit on the subcommittee responsible for the Armenian Genocide legislation, it's clear that she's a favorite of the Turkish community. With $18,450 in contributions from three Turkish-focused PACs since 2007, the second-term House member has received far more than even influential senior members, and nearly twice as much as the second-highest recipient, Virginia Foxx, whose son-in-law is Turkish. A list of fundraisers compiled by the Turkish Coalition USA PAC shows that the group held several events for Schmidt, raising thousands more. And four individuals who gave to Turkish PACs also donated a combined $8,700 directly to Schmidt's campaign.

At issue before the Ohio Board of Elections is whether Krikorian's language holds upâ€”whether it was accurate to describe three Turkey-focused political action committees as â€œTurkish sponsored.â€ The false claims complaint against Krikorian comes after the board censured Schmidt for a â€œreckless disregard for truthâ€ in her own campaign literature.

Lobbyists for the government of Turkey, including former congressmen Bob Livingston, made more than <a href=""http://foreignlobbying.org/client/Embassy%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Turkey"">2,260</a> <a href=""http://foreignlobbying.org/client/Government%20of%20Turkey"">contacts</a> with officials in an unparalleled push to quash a resolution in Congress that would deem the events genocide. But political action committees favored by Turkish Americans have, on paper, no direct connection with the state.

In a <a href=""http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1210111/Jean%20depo.pdf"">deposition</a>, Schmidt repeatedly told Krikorianâ€™s attorneys that she could not recall details about her fundraising and legislative discussions. She said she had never heard of the Armenian massacres until Krikorianâ€”who is of Armenian heritageâ€”raised the issue, and that she still hasn't decided how she would vote on a resolution that would condemn the act as genocide, should it reach the House floor.

But materials put out by the Turkish Coalition of America and authored by a lawyer, Bruce Fein, who now represents Schmidt in the complaint, say that â€œCongresswoman Schmidt has on numerous occasions voiced her opposition to such resolutions and maintains that the historical question is not appropriate for Congress to legislate. The congresswoman, based on her independent research, does not believe the tragic events... constitute genocide.â€

Schmidt acknowledged reading a book on the killings by Guenter Lewy, a college professor, which figures in a controversy of its own. The Southern Poverty Law Center claimed that the government of Turkey paid Lewy to pen the book, â€œThe Armenian Massacres in Ottoman Turkey: A Disputed Genocide,â€ in a manner favorable to the country. In December, Lewy, represented by two lawyers from the Turkish American Defense Fund who also hold positions at the Turkish Coalition of Americaâ€”Bruce Fein and David Saltzman--sued the Southern Poverty Law Center and the report's author, on the grounds that the article claimed that Lewy was an unregistered foreign agent, which he says is false. The government of Turkey has funded academic programs, including the Institute for Turkish Studies at Georgetown University, and endowed professorships.

As Krikorianâ€™s counsel questioned Schmidt about whether the PACs were indeed â€œsponsoredâ€ by the state of Turkey, he repeatedly tried to nail down Schmidt's view of the 1915 events. Schmidt sought some wiggle-room by saying that genocides were, by definition, state-sponsored, and that no trial or tribunal had concluded that the massacre was directly linked to the government at the time.

In June, while President Barack Obama visited Turkey, an essay appeared in a Turkish newspaper under Schmidt's byline opining that the United States should not investigate the killings. ""What happened in 1915 must never be forgotten,"" the article said, but in her deposition, Schmidt was squishy about just what happened.

A fundraising e-mail from a Turkish PAC says she is â€œwilling to stand up to the Armenian lobby, and it is important for the Turkish community to support her.â€  But Schmidt, who says her campaign was run by her husband, her chief of staff and interns, claimed to have no role in setting up the fundraisers, no inkling of why Turkish donors had become a surprising part of her fundraising base and no recollection of meeting top donors, including one who chauffeured her around Turkey. (In May, Schmidt took a $10,000 trip to Turkey, sponsored by the Turkish Coalition of America.)

It's not the first time Schmidt has declined to take a clear position or found herself making statements contradicted by her record. This week, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YshG_Ok8idc&amp;fmt=18"">video surfaced</a> of her telling a woman who claimed that Obama may not have been born in the United States that she agrees with her, despite having previously issued a statement saying he is â€œindeed a citizen of this country.â€

Schmidt expressed little familiarity with the workings of her campaign as well as the complex ties between Turkish groups, including the Turkish American Legal Defense Fund, whose lawyers, she says, are being paid in campaign funds. (The latest expense reports don't reveal the amount.)

â€œWhat is the Turkish American Legal Defense Fund?â€ she is asked.

â€œIt's a U.S. organization that has a PAC,â€ she answers.

â€œThe Legal Defense Fund does?â€

1677	Defense contractors join Turkish lobbying effort in pursuit of arms deals	defense-contractors-join-turkish-lobbying-effor	27	"The Defense Departmentâ€™s request last week for congressional approval of the sale of $8 billion worth of PAC-3 missiles to Turkey was the latest victory for a disparate group of interests including defense contractors, finance and energy corporations, trade groups, the Turkish government and a well-financed network of domestic advocacy groups. Intersecting interests have led them to join forces and lobby on a number of issues, including the characterization of distant historical events.

Turkey and the domestic advocacy groups that promote the interests of Turkish-Americans did so to protect the Turkeyâ€™s image, while U.S. companies sought to bolster their own bottom lines. The efforts appear to have been successful for all the parties.

The Turkish government has consistently lavished millions each year on well-connected Washington lobbying firms--including those employing former House leaders--which contacted offices of the lower chamber 1,468 times, according to an analysis of data from <a href=""http://www.foreignlobbying.org"">Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker</a> of disclosures filed in 2008 by firms under the Foreign Agent Registration Actâ€”nearly twice that of the second-highest country, Libya.

Turkeyâ€™s efforts have now been augmented by a domestic effort launched by a Turkish-American entrepreneur. Yalcin Ayasli founded Hittite Microwave in 1985 as a one-man company with a grant from the U.S. Air Force, and built the electronics company into a firm worth $1.2 billion, with half of its products sold overseas, according to a company presentation. The company had $180 million in revenue in 2008, according to SEC filings.

Since 2004, Hittite Microwave has received roughly $30 million in contracts directly from the governmentâ€”mostly to sponsor research and developmentâ€”and has also done business with Lockheed Martin and other prime contractors, many of whom use Hittite electronics in their jets and other equipment, sold to both the U.S. military and Turkey.

In 2007, Ayasli transferred $30 million in stock to fund a new endeavor, the nonprofit Turkish Coalition of America. The organization is headquartered in a Washington suite that has also been listed as the address for the Turkish Coalition USA PAC, the lobbying firm of Lydia Borland (who has represented the Turkish government), and the law firm of Bruce Fein and Associates (Fein comprises half of the Turkish American Legal Defense Fund).

The family of Hittite founder Ayaslin contributed nearly half a million dollars to federal politics in 2007-2008, donating near the maximum amount to the House campaign committees for both parties, but largely neglecting the Senate.

TCA is headed by Lincoln McCurdy, who served as a U.S. diplomat in Istanbul from 1980 to 1984, and also functions as treasurer of the political action committee; he draws an additional retainer as Ayasli's â€œpersonal advisorâ€ on â€œpolitical matters,â€ in his own words. From 1989 to 2004, McCurdy led the American Turkish Council, a lobbying organization funded by membership dues from defense and energy companies with an interest in Turkey, and whose executive ranks include Borland.

In addition to the advocacy done through the ATC (which also funds trips to Turkey for congressional staff), a handful of its members--Citigroup, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, Chevron, Textron, United Technologies, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, which spent a combined $80 million lobbying Washington last yearâ€”lobbied Congress directly on the genocide resolution and other issues important to Turkey; the Aerospace Industries Association, a trade group, helped coordinate the effort.

<strong>A matter of historical record</strong>

For Turkey and its allies, perception has been everything when it comes to the nearly century-old killings that left more than a million Armenians dead as the Ottoman Empire collapsed. The country has lobbied House and Senate and the executive branch to oppose congressional resolutions to label the incidents genocide, and funded academic programs that bolster the countryâ€™s image and downplay the role of the government in the killings.

Those programs include the Institute for Turkish Studies at Georgetown University, which received an initial $3 million disbursement from Turkey in 1982 and continues to draw annual financial support from the government, and is chaired by Nabi Sensoy, Turkeyâ€™s ambassador to the United States. In 2006, a board member, Donald <span lang=""en-us""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">Quataert</span></span>, resigned from the institute, claiming that after he acknowledged in an academic review that the Armenian killings met the definition of genocide, Sensoy told him Turkish authorities had threatened to revoke the Institute's  funding. Sensoy disputed the allegations.

The Turkish American Legal Defense Fund, financed by TCA, aggressively pursues those who threaten the country's reputation, including suing the Southern Poverty Law Center and David Holthouse, a journalist who prepared a report for the nonprofit, for upwards of $8 million on behalf of an academic. In that case, the Foreign Agents Registration Act is at issue. Holthouse suggested that, as part of a group of professors who have enjoyed endowed positions at universities financed directly by the government of Turkey and who have expressed views on the killings outside of the academic mainstream, he was acting as a foreign agent. If true, the academic would be required to file detailed disclosures with the U.S. Justice Department.

<strong>Courting Ankara</strong>

Since the beginning of the war in Iraq in 2003, the U.S. government has been especially wary of riling Turkey, which shares a border with the war-torn country. Despite widespread support for the resolution labeling the Armenian killings genocide, lawmakers have consistently kept it from a floor voteâ€”even in 2007, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed her preference for a vote.

Few members have been as vocal as opposing the resolution as Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who sits on the House Foreign Affairs committee and is a top recipient of Turkish Coalition USA PAC money.

More quietly, U.S. companies with interests in Turkey have lobbied on the resolution. For U.S. defense contractors, the Turkish armed forces are a multi-billion dollar marketâ€”Lockheed Martin and Raytheon would benefit from to latest proposed missile sale. Chevron is constructing a pipeline that passes through Turkey. CitiGroup, which has funded development projects in Turkey since 1975, acquired a twenty percent stake in the countryâ€™s largest private bank in 2006, and acquired an investment brokerage in 2007.

By itself, Turkey boasts a formidable army of Washington lobbyists. The government has employed the Livingston Group, which boasts Bob Livingston, whoâ€™d served as chair of the House Appropriations Committee in the 1990s; Dickstein Shapiro LLP, which has former House Speaker Dennis Hastert on its payroll; DLA Piper, which employed former House majority leader Dick Armey, and the Gephardt Group, led by former House minority leader and Democratic presidential candidate Richard Gephardt. With the addition of corporate interests and its network of domestic supporters, it has built a formidable influence operationâ€”one that can prevent legislation from coming to a vote."		2009-09-17 14:13:51	2009-09-17 14:13:51	2009-09-17 14:13:51	1	0	1

<b>Page 176-177:</b> The Chairmanâ€˜s Mark would require any manufacturer of a covered drug, device, biological, or medical supply that makes a payment or another transfer of value to a physician, a physician medical practice, a physician group practice, or a hospital with an approved medical residency training program to report annually, in electronic form, specified information on such transactions to the Secretary of HHS. The report would include the transfer recipientâ€˜s name, business address, amount of the payment, date of the payment, a description of the form of the payment, a description of the nature of the payment, if the payment is related to marketing, education, or research specific to a covered drug, device, biological or medical supply the name of that product, and any other category of information that the Secretary determines appropriate. If the recipient requests a transfer of payment to another entity or individual at the request of the recipient the manufacturer should disclose that information. Delayed reporting requirements would apply for payments made pursuant to a product development agreement or clinical trial. Some information would be excluded from these reporting requirements, including payments or transfers of $10 or less, unless the aggregate annual payments or transfers to a recipient exceeds $100, in which case all payments or transfers shall be reported, samples intended for patient use, patient educational materials, loan of a covered device for a short-term time period, discounts and rebates, payments made to a physician for the provision of health care to employees, payments to a physician who is also a licensed, non-medical professional if the payment is solely related to non-medical services, payments to a physician solely for services related to a civil or criminal action or an administrative proceeding, and in-kind items used for charity care. This reporting requirement would begin on March 31, 2012 and continue on the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year.

The Chairmanâ€˜s Mark also requires any such manufacturer, or related group purchasing organization to report annually to the Secretary, in electronic form, certain information regarding any ownership or investment interest (other than in a publicly traded security and mutual fund) held by a physician (or an immediate family member) in the manufacturer or group purchasing organization during the preceding year.

Manufacturers or group purchasing organizations would be subject to a civil money penalty (CMP) of not less than $1,000 but not more than $10,000 for each payment or transfer not reported. The total amount of the penalties for any annual submission shall not exceed $150,000. Any manufacturer or group purchasing organization that knowingly fails to submit information would be subject to a CMP of not less than $10,000 but not more than $100,000 for each payment or transfer not reported. The total amount of the penalties for this failure to report category of submissions shall not exceed $1,000,000 annually.

The Chairmanâ€˜s Mark would require the Secretary to establish procedures no later than October 1, 2010 to ensure public availability of this information. Beginning September 30, 2012 and on June 30 of subsequent years, submitted information should be available on an Internet website that meets formatting, search, and usability requirements. In addition to the transfer information, the website should include information on enforcement actions during the preceding year, background information on industry-physician relationships, a separate listing for payments related to clinical research, and other information that the Secretary deems appropriate. The Secretary should also allow recipients an opportunity to submit corrections to their information. This reporting procedure should be established after consulting the Office of the Inspector General (HHS OIG), affected industry, consumers and other parties in order to ensure that the information is presented in an appropriate context. The Secretary would be required to submit an annual report to Congress and the states beginning April 1, 2012.

Effective January 1, 2011 the Chairmanâ€˜s Mark would preempt any state (or political subdivision of a state) law or regulation that requires manufacturers to disclose the type of information required under this provision regarding payments or transfers to covered recipients. The Mark would not preempt any state (or political subdivision of a state) law or regulation that requires the disclosure or reporting of (1) any information not required under this provision; (2) the types of information excluded from reporting requirements under this provision, with the exception of the $10 de minimis/$100 aggregate reporting requirement; (3) information by any person or entity other than an applicable manufacturer or covered recipient described above; and (4) information reported to a Federal, state, or local government for public health purposes.

The Secretary would be required to consult with the HHS OIG on the implementation of this section. [<b>physicians, device manufacturers, pharmaceutical firms, medical suppliers, HHS</b>]

SNFs [Skilled nursing facilities] and nursing facilities would be required to make available on request by the Secretary, the HHS OIG, the state, and the state long term care ombudsman, information on ownership (including direct and indirect ownership) and additional disclosable parties as well as information describing the governing body and organizational structure of the facility. Information would be made available to the Secretary, the HHS OIG, the state and state long term care ombudsman programs upon request. To the extent that the required information is submitted to the IRS as part of Form 990, to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or to the Secretary, facilities would be permitted to make the information available in these formats. 

Information to be disclosed would include the identity of and information on each member of the governing body of the facility (name, title, period of service); each person or entity who is an officer, director, member, partner, trustee, or managing employee of the facility; and each person or entity who is an additional disclosable party of the facility.

Additional disclosable parties would be defined as any persons or entities (1) that exercise operational, managerial or financial control over the facility or part thereof, or provides policies or procedures for any of the operations of the facility, or provides financial or cash management services to the facility; (2) lease or sublease real property to the facility, or owns a whole or part interest equal to or exceeding five percent of the total value of such real property; (3) lend funds or provide financial guarantees which is equal to or exceeds $50,000; and (4) that provide management or administrative services, management or clinical consulting services, or accounting or financial services to the facility.

The Secretary and the states would be required to develop a standardized format through regulation for facilities to report information about ownership and additional disclosable parties within two years of enactment.

The Secretary, within one year of promulgating regulations requiring reporting by facilities, would be required to make available to the public information about ownership and additional disclosable parties. The Secretary would also be required to provide guidance and technical assistance to states on how to adopt the standardized format. [<b>Nursing homes, HHS, states</b>]

<b>Page 180-181:</b> The Chairmanâ€˜s Mark would require the Secretary to include additional information on the Medicare Nursing Home Compare website.

The Secretary would be required to establish a process to review the accuracy, clarity of the presentation, timeliness, and comprehensiveness of information currently reported on Nursing Home Compare; and a process to modify or revamp the site in accordance with comments received after review. In conducting the review, the Secretary would be required to consult with state long term care ombudsman programs, consumer advocacy groups, provider stakeholder groups, and other representatives of programs or groups as the Secretary determines appropriate.

States would be required to submit survey information to the Secretary no later than they send such information to the facility, and requires the Secretary to use this information to update Nursing Home Compare as expeditiously as practicable. Facilities would be required to have available on request the preceding three yearsâ€˜ of inspection reports (Form 2567 reports), complaint investigations and the facilityâ€˜s plan of correction or other response to the Form 2567 report. Facilities would also be required to post notice of the availability of such reports in areas of the facility that are prominent and accessible to the public.

1694	Corruption charges prompt Congo to lobby Congress	corruption-charges-prompt-congo-to-lobby-congress	3	"In the past few years a handful of private equity or hedge funds have garnered a reputation as â€œvulture funds,â€ a term coined to describe companies that profit from the debt of extremely poor countries. The hedge funds buy defaulted debt for pennies on the dollar, then sue them later for the full amount owed in U.S. and European courts.

Both in 2008 and earlier this year, members of Congress introduced bills to protect these debtor nations from lawsuits. The legislation was introduced after heavy lobbying campaigns by countries like the Republic of the Congo, which has spent millions of dollars hiring D.C.-based heavyweight lobbying firms.

The hedge firms--like Kensington International Ltd. which fought a long drawn case with the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville)--claim that corrupt practices by rulers, and not the poverty of the countries, are the reason they are not able to repay their debts.

Kensington International, based in the Cayman Islands, is a subsidiary of Elliott Associates, a New York company. In the 1990s, Kensington bought up several debt packages worth $100 million from Congo, which led to a decade-long round of negotiations and legal battles spanning a few continents before the lawsuit was settled in 2007. But before that happened, Kensington International's sleuthing uncovered a series of hidden bank accounts, some belonging to the Presidentâ€™s son, straw men and companies in tax-haven countries run by the head of the Congoâ€™s state-owned oil and gas company SNPC.

While the court case was still underway, the Office of President Denis Sassouâ€“Nguesso of the Republic of the Congo hired lobbyists, according to filings under the Foreign Agents Registration Act maintained by the Department of Justice. In 2006, the <a href=""http://www.fara.gov/docs/5733-Supplemental-Statement-20061011-1.pdf"">filings</a> show, SNPC paid Trout Casheries LLC, its U.S. lobbyists, the sum of $700,000 on behalf of the Republic of the Congo. The filing was the first time that the lobbying issues specifically related to debt management were listed; Trout Casheries also disclosed that they represented the President of the Republic  of Congo, Sassou-Nguesso, â€œto respond to allegations of misconduct directed by creditors.â€

According to the 2008 filings, the country spent $590,000 on lobbying alone and a total of $3.2 million to retain lawyers and for â€œnon-FARA relatedâ€ activities, including public relations campaigns and consultancy fees. They employed four lobbying firms, the <a href=""http://foreignlobbying.org/client/Office%20of%20the%20President%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Congo/"">Livingston Group</a>, <a href=""http://foreignlobbying.org/client/President%20Dennis%20Sassou-N%27guesso%2C%20President%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Congo/"">Trout Casheries LLC,Chlopak Leonard Schechter and Associates and the Loeffler Group</a>, that waged an intensive heavy lobbying campaign. Lobbyists from the firms met with members of Congress, their staff and executive branch officials about 1500 times--mostly to discuss vulture funds, according to data from <a href=""http://www.foreignlobbying.org"">Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker</a>.

People with close connections to President Sassouâ€“Nguesso, including his son, Denis Christel Saasou-Nguesso and close aide Denis Gokana who was then the head of SNPC, feature prominently in the legal dispute between the vultures and the Republic of the Congo. In addition to SNPC, Gokana headed two other companies, Sphynx Bermuda and Africa Oil and Gas.

Kensingtonâ€™s sleuthing uncovered that the SNPC, through its trading arm Cotrade, was selling Congolese oil to intermediaries; instead of direct trade, the off-shore companies headed by Gokana siphoned off millions of barrels of oil before delivering the rest to commercial markets in Europe and elsewhere.

Kensington argued that the diverted funds should be used to repay the country's creditors rather than enrich individuals close to the president. They sued various parties in U.S. federal court, including banking giants BNP Paribas for aiding Congo in diverting the oil revenues, using the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act, which was changed under the Patriot Act to give U.S.courts jurisdiction over international money laundering operations.

A <a href=""http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/556/en/congo_is_presidents_son_paying_for_designer_shoppi"">separate investigation</a> of Congo's oil industry by Global Witness, a U.K.-based non-profit, uncovered documents that furthered the investigation. They published credit card receipts in 2007 showing that Denis Cristelâ€™s personal shopping for designer wear in Dubai and Paris were paid for by accounts from another off-shore company, Long Beach. They also discovered that Long Beach had received payments from companies set up by Gokana.

The report found that Sphynx and Africa Oil were both controlled by Gokana, and found that his role as a special counsel to the President while he controlled private companies was a conflict of interest, one that was prohibited under the statutes that created the state oil company, SNPC.

Although there is very little mention of these allegations of corruption in the U.S. media, European outlets <a href=""http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article4138445.ece"">have covered</a> the story. At the end of a two-year court battle, Congo reached an out of court settlement with Kensington International an undisclosed amount.

Despite the revelations unearthed in Kensington International's suit, some in Congress continue to argue that impoverished nations are being short changed. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who serves on the who is on the Subcommittee on International Monetary Policy, has reintroduced the Stop Vulture Funds Act. She or her staffers <a href=""http://foreignlobbying.org/legislator/Waters%2C%20Maxine/"">met</a> with lobbyists for the Republic of the Congo about â€œvultureâ€ funds at least 40 times in the one year period. A similar bill was sponsored in the Senate by Robert Casey, D-Pa., in 2008. Casey was never contacted by Congoâ€™s lobbyists.

To counter the lobbying efforts by the Congo, Elliott Associates hired Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld to represent them in Washington, spending $570,000 in 2008 alone.

Waters' <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/googlesearch.xpd?cx=partner-pub-3418906291605762%3Assmjto-kmpt&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=vulture+funds&amp;sa=Search#865"">bill</a> would prohibit U.S. citizens from trying to profit from defaulted sovereign debt, and bar U.S. courts from acting on cases filed by sovereign debt ""profiteers.â€

Waters' office has not returned phone calls or e-mails commenting on the issue.

Since the Office of Management and Budget posted its <a href=""http://www.omb.gov/earmarks"">earmark database</a>, I've found it hard to concentrate on the 1990 portion of the SF-LLL timeline (which is mostly written but still needs a lot of links).

<blockquote><strong>Virginia Equine Center Foundation / Virginia Horse Center Foundation</strong>

1 recipient will receive $992,000. This is a first-time earmark.

Description: The earmark funds were used to provide a USDA Rural Development Community Facilities grant of $992,000 to the Virginia Equine Center Foundation. It was used to construct a community and therapeutic riding facility at the Virginia Horse Center. This grant was assumed by the Virginia Horse Center Foundation. The community and therapeutic riding facility provides a weekly education program to learning disabled students from the counties of Alleghany, Bath, Botetourt, and Rockbridge. It also provides therapeutic riding services to cancer patients referred from the University of Virginia and the Medical College of Virginia. The organization intends to offer similar services to the Rockbridge and Buena Vista School systems. USDA Rural Development, also provided a Community Facilities Direct Loan of $11,500,000 to the Virginia Horse Center Foundation, which was used to purchase the Virginia Horse Center in Rockbridge County, Virginia, from the Virginia Equine Center Foundation. The Virginia Horse Center is a 600-acre facility for horse shows and other livestock events. There are currently eight barns, eighteen show rings and arenas, including a 300' x 150' indoor coliseum. There is a five-mile Olympic caliber cross-country course, and also an internationally recognized carriage driving marathon course on Virginia Horse Center property. The Center also offers additional amenities including: 2 campgrounds, a restaurant, banquet facilities, and a gift shop.</blockquote>
The Commonwealth of Virginia set up the Virginia Equine Center Foundation (the governor appoints its board members), while the Virginia Horse Center Foundation seems to be a traditional 501(c)3. I looked on the <a href=""http://www.horsecenter.org/view.asp?id=home"">Virginia Horse Center Web site</a>, and while I found plenty of information on <a href=""http://www.horsecenter.org/view.asp?id=clinics"">clinics</a> for horse owners and <a href=""http://www.horsecenter.org/pdfs/arabian/Spring%20Arabian%20Classic%20Prize%20Book%2007.pdf"">showing off</a> thoroughbreds, there was on information on therapeutic riding.

172	Contract but no Contacts: McCain Campaign Official's Firm Collects Millions from Saudis but no Meetings with Members of Congress	contract-but-no-contacts-mccain-campaign-officials-firm-collects-millions-from-saudis-but-no-meetings-with-members-of-congress	3	"In the five years prior to joining Arizona Sen. John McCainÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s presidential campaign, Thomas LoefflerÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s lobbying firm contacted U.S. government officials, including members of Congress, staff and executive branch officials, an average of 58 times during every six month reporting period on behalf of the government of Saudi Arabia. In the year that Loeffler has served on McCainÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s campaign, employees at the firm reported only one contact on behalf of the Saudis, though it continued to receive fees from the oil kingdom Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¬ some $3.5 million in all, according to the federal disclosure documents.

The forms, required by the Foreign Agents Registration Act, are filed with the Department of Justice every six months. The most recent <a href=""http://www.fara.gov/docs/5432-Supplemental-Statement-20080118-6.pdf"">disclosure</a> states that the firm received $990,000 in lobbing fees and another $3,000 in expenses from the Saudi government to lobby on trade issues from May to November 2007, but does not cite any in-person meetings, phone conversations or e-mails with any executive branch official, member of Congress or staff. According to the <a href=""http://www.fara.gov/docs/5432-Supplemental-Statement-20070629-5.pdf"">May 2007 filing</a> there was only one teleconference on March 26, two weeks after Loeffler joined McCain's campaign. FARA requires lobbyists of foreign governments to disclose all such contacts in the biannual filings with the Department of Justice.

According to the<a href=""http://www.fara.gov/docs/5432-Supplemental-Statement-20080118-6.pdf""> November 2007,</a> disclosure forms signed by Tom Loeffler, the firm ""provided services related to interaction between foreign principal and Members of Congress, congressional staff, officials in the Executive Branch and the World Trade Organization."" Although it is possible that there were no reportable contacts during the time, the forms do not explicitly say so.

By contrast, disclosure forms filed in 2006 by the Loeffler Group in <a href=""http://www.fara.gov/docs/5432-Supplemental-Statement-20060630-3.pdf"">May</a> and <a href=""http://www.fara.gov/docs/5432-Supplemental-Statement-20070130-4.pdf"">November</a> detail meetings with members of Congress, including one with McCain on May 17, 2006. The filings also show that in 2006, Tom Loeffler had facilitated meetings between then Saudi Ambassador Price Turki Al-Faisal and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., to discuss ""U.S.-Saudi relations."" The November 2006, disclosure shows that meetings were convened between Tom Loeffler and Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, in June.

The Loeffler Group has received close to $15 million since 2003 when they began to lobby for the Saudi government. In 2006, the year after Saudi Arabia entered the WTO group of countries, the Loeffler Group received more than $7million from the Saudis in lobbying fees, FARA documents show.The firm declined to comment on any of their lobbying disclosure filings.

In addition to the Saudis, the Loeffler Group's other foreign clients include the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, a government agency that hired the firm to lobby on trade issues including international trade policy, U.S.-China trade relationship and the WTO.

Loeffler, who represented Texas as a member of the House of Representatives <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.asp?name=Loeffler%2C+Tom&amp;id=10644"">from 1978 to 1986</a>, serves as the <a href=""http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/PressReleases/a1b589b6-9d01-44c1-a95a-f4ba81d6f367.htm"">general co-chair</a> of McCain's campaign.  Susan Nelson, another Loeffler Group employee who also lobbied on behalf of Saudi government, later left the firm to take up a position with McCain as campaign finance director.

Ties between the McCain camp and the Loeffler Group run deeper: Employees of the lobbying firm have given more than $13,000 to the McCain presidential campaign, with Tom Loeffler making a maximum primary contribution of $2300 in June 2007.

Last week, Mark Penn, a lobbyist with Penn, Schoen &amp; Berland, <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080406/ap_on_el_pr/clinton_penn"">stepped down</a> as top strategist for Sen. Hillary ClintonÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s, D-N.Y. He resigned after news reports that Penn, a lobbyist for the government of Colombia advocated for trade policies that Clinton opposed. Though Penn tried to distance himself from his firm's advocacy to the Colombian government, which led them to drop their contract with Penn's firm, it still cost Penn his job.

In Loeffler's case, the filings don't list any meetings, though they do describe ongoing advocacy for the Saudi government and show hefty fees as well.

Loeffler has been involved in some lobbying efforts while working for the McCain campaign. According to an <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=4426783"">Associated Press</a> report from earlier this year, he lobbied on behalf of European Aeronautic Defense and Space Co.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¬ the parent company of Airbus Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¬ while serving as one of McCainÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s chief advisers. One of the key issues that was lobbied on by EADS was the aerial refueling contract. In the past couple of years, McCain has been nudging the Pentagon to ensure that their bidding procedures do not leave out Airbus.

1729	"Revealing the ""Hidden Budget"""	1729	20	"Â 

Our colleagues at The Pew Charitable Trusts, with whom we collaborate on <a href=""http://www.subsidyscope.com/"">Subsidyscope</a>, have produced a nine-page <a href=""http://subsidyscope.com/media/pdf/Subsidyscope%20Framing%20Paper.pdf"">overview</a> of federal subsidies -- the ""hidden budget"" -- that's worth a read.

The paper is packed with interesting data and useful context. For instance:

*In 2007, the federal government subsidized about $874 billion of the nation's health care.

*The first known U.S. subsidy -- which gave fishermen five cents for every barrel of pickled fish they exported -- dates to 1789.

*From 1974 to 2004, the amount of revenue lost to the government due to tax breaks tripled, from $240 billion to $730 billion.

*The biggest tax break -- ""Exclusion of employer contributions for medical insurance premiums and medical care"" -- is projected to cost the government $155 billion in fiscal year 2010, which starts tomorrow. The second-biggest -- the mortgage-interest deduction -- is expected to lop off another $108 billion in revenue.

Keep coming back to Subsidyscope as we unearth stories on little-noticed federal programs and extricate datasets buried in the bowels of federal agencies (in some cases pried loose only with the aid of the Freedom of Information Act). As the Pew people put it in their paper, ""We are taking something that is hard to find and making it easy to get.

I've come across some interesting stuff along the way, including this <a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=85778&p=irol-politicalContributions"">General Dynamics statement</a> on their political contributions:

<blockquote>General Dynamics participates in the U.S. political process when it is in the best interests of its shareholders, businesses and employees to do so. Participation in this process ensures that the companyÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s interests as a leading member of the defense and aerospace industries, as well as a large employer, are well represented.

The company makes contributions on a limited basis to 501(c)(4) organizations as well as to state and local candidates, where permissible and in accordance with all laws and regulations. On occasion, the company provides funding for organizations that function under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code.</blockquote>

The whole thing makes interesting reading.

1735	Shining a Bright New Light on an Old Game	1735-revision	29	"Jaws dropped around the Sunlight offices a couple of weeks ago, when we discovered â€“ after a month's worth of painstaking research â€“ the <a href=""http://bit.ly/27jYt"">extent</a> to which lobbyist donations were <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/lm_health.php?type=M"">echoing</a>, and in some cases greatly <a href=""http://bit.ly/baucuswheel"">supplementing</a>, the campaign contributions of their clients.

We suspected there would be plenty of lobbyists giving money in concert with the organizations they represent, but we had no idea that we'd find cases where one, two or three dozen lobbyists gave to the same member as their clients.

Yet discoveries like that are just the sort of things that tend to pop to the surface when you take a fresh look at an old phenomenon, which is what Sunlight did with this collaborative investigative project with the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org"">Center for Responsive Politics</a>.

The job of tracking lobbyist contributions has been a tricky one even since the Center for Responsive Politics first started categorizing campaign money more than 20 years ago. Because lobbyists have so many clients, often from different industries, the only way to logically classify their contributions was to list them simply as â€œlobbyists.â€

While that made it possible to track the total impact of their personal contributions, it also split the lobbyists from the clients they represent. Thus, a lobbyist for a big drug manufacturer would be counted under â€œlobbyists,â€ not â€œhealthcare.â€

There had to be a better way to account for their real impact, and finally we came up with one. By combining the contribution databases with the lobbyist databases--records that simply didn't exist 20 years ago--we could finally begin to investigate the connections between the lobbyists and their clients to see if they were giving in concert.

<a href=""http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/images/blog/infographics/finance_committee/baucus_wheel.html""><img class=""aligncenter"" src=""http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/images/blog/infographics/finance_committee/baucus_wheel_promo.gif"" alt=""Wheel of Health Care Fortune"" /></a>

To do it right, we first had to find all the lobbyists. Since the great majority of federally registered lobbyists live in and around Washington, we started by examining all campaign contributions from residents of DC, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, from January 2007--the start of the 2007-2008 election cycle--through the latest available data in the 2009-2010 election cycle.

Then, with the help of a matching program developed by CRP, we examined each contribution by hand, weeding out donors with similar names, identifying spouses who also contributed, and finally linking the lobbyist donors with their clients from the lobbyist database. When that was complete, we then cast a wider net, checking whether any of the lobbyists we'd identified had also given contributions from outside the DC area.

The final step was reviewing all PAC and individual contributions to each member of Congress since 2007 and finding every case where both the lobbyist and their client gave money to the same member of Congress during that two-and-a-half year period.

That was when we discovered the size of the 'bundles' â€“ something that had previously been invisible. We began the investigation by looking at organizations in the health and insurance industries, since healthcare is the number one issue on Capitol Hill at the moment, but the research we've now completed will enable us to expand to other industries as well.

Don't assume for a minute that we've found a new golden bullet that fully explains the role of lobbyists in Washington. Giving direct contributions is only one of many ways that lobbyists win friends and influence people on Capitol Hill. Hosting fundraisers is another, as is advising clients on how best to spread their PAC contributions.

But this research has given us a much more rounded view of the financial clout that lobbyists can bring to bear for their friends in the Capitol. After all, most lobbyists give only nominal amounts of money directly to members of Congress. The big money comes from their clients.

Now, for the first time, we're poised to track it.

Much credit for the timeliness of this project goes to the amazingly hard-working staff of the Center for Responsive Politics, who had to pull a full court press of their own over the past two weeks to get this information out the door. Besides executive director Sheila Krumholz, a small army of researchers toiled to dig through the data â€“ especially Jihan Andoni, Susi Alger, Matthias Jaime, Dave Levinthal, Douglas Weber, Hector Rivera, Dan Auble, Carolyn Sharpe, Erin Williams, Lindsay Renick Mayer, Michael Becker and Ben Pilkerton.

On the Sunlight side of the street, the heavy lifting behind the scenes was done by Kerry Mitchell--who did our visualization--Gabriella Schneider, Noah Kunin, Luke Rosiak, Anupama Narayanswamy and Bill Allison. The green light to get the project rolling in the first place came from the same place it usually does at the Sunlight Foundation: executive director Ellen Miller, without whom none of this information would have ever seen the light of day.

Stay tuned--this <a href=""http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/presscenter/releases/2009/10/01/hidden-bundles-lobbyist-giving/"">first release</a> is just the tip of the iceberg; there's much more to come."		2009-10-01 21:33:36	2009-10-01 21:33:36	2009-10-01 21:33:36	1	0	1

1749	Digging into recovery.gov data	digging-into-recovery-gov-data	3	"Weâ€™re playing with the new stimulus data released last week on the <a href=""http://www.recovery.gov/Pages/home.aspx"">Recovery.gov</a> Web site - analyzing the data, trying to find out which states are receiving the most money and what kinds of projects are receiving the most money. Data on contracts can be downloaded from<a href=""https://www.fpds.gov/""> FPDS</a> site and the grants and loans from the <a href=""http://www.usaspending.gov/"">USAspending</a> Web site.

Although there is an easy way of downloading contracts data from FPDS, those wanting either grants or loans data will have to rely on the USASpending site, which allows downloads of slices of the data, from each agency or state. Unless users know how to work with the XML version, running aggregate functions on the data to get to the bigger picture such as the total spent by all the agencies in a specific state would be challenging and time consuming.

Also, the grants, loans and contracts cannot be put together to see, for example, which state is getting the most dollars through the Recovery Act. Most of the loans and the grants that are disbursed are given by federal agencies to states--for example, say the Dept. of Transportation gives a grant to Virginia for $10 million to build highways.Â Most often (but not always), the states award that grant money through contracts, which show up in the contract data in Recovery.gov. Combining grant and contract data would lead to counting some of the money twice, giving a state give highly inflated numbers.

So far, other than playing around with the maps and search by zip code feature, I find the <a href=""http://www.recovery.gov/pages/TextViewProjSummary.aspx?data=awardsList&amp;State=ALL&amp;Agency=ALL&amp;Amount=ALL&amp;AwardType=ALL&amp;RenderData=ALL"">text view</a> in the â€œSee where the money is goingâ€ page to be the most useful.

1756	Follow the (Airport) Money	follow-the-airport-money	2	"Over the past five years, the Federal Aviation Administration has handed out nearly $18 billion in grants for almost 19,000 airport projects. In theory, these projects -- funded through the FAA's Airport Improvement Program -- are supposed to enhance safety or protect the environment. In fact, according to a <a href=""http://www.subsidyscope.com"">Subsidyscope </a>analysis of FAA data (neatly assembled into a <a href=""http://www.subsidyscope.com/projects/transportation/aip/search/"">searchable database </a>by Sunlight's Kaitlin Lee), a fair amount of money has gone toward the building of parking lots and other questionable things.

We've only scratched the surface but have managed to extract a few interesting items from the database. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2005, for instance, airports in the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau have received an impressive $173 million through the <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/airports/aip/overview/"">AIP</a>. The sovereign Pacific island nations became eligible for AIP money in 2003 after signing a Compact of Free Association with the United States. Under the compact, the U.S. agreed to provide financial assistance in exchange for the granting of defense rights.

Another $82 million went to Guam International Airport. Back on the mainland, Plattsburgh International Airport in upstate New York secured $26 million. Fat sums went to a number of obscure, general aviation airports, to theÂ annoyance ofÂ commercial aviation types who'd like more grant money to go to the hubs that accommodate the airlines. The AIP, they argue, is fed to a great extent by taxes on passenger tickets and jet fuel, yet a disproportionate share of the money goes to non-commercial airports.
Â 
Our database allows the public to find out what the FAA thought of projects at airports as big as O'Hare International in Chicago and as small as Beauregard Regional in DeRidder, La., before approving them. Through a Freedom of Information Act request, we obtained National Priority Ratings -- NPRs -- for every AIP project from Oct. 1, 2004 through Sept. 18, 2009. NPRs are assigned on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the highest priority. NPRs for the Guam projects ranged from a lowly 19 (for utility improvements) to a respectable 66 (for an updated master plan). The Plattsburgh projects earned scores ranging from 17 (for a parking lot) toÂ 93 (for a fire and rescue vehicle). And the projects in Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau got scores ranging from 19 (to modify a service road) to 90 (for fire and rescue equipment). The FAA's NPR threshold for discretionary grants (as opposed to formula-driven entitlement grants) isÂ 41; for stimulus grants, 62. In both cases, projects scoring well below those numbers got in on the AIP bounty. In an <a href=""http://http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=/data/pdfdocs/Final_ARRA_Advisory_AIP_(3).pdf"">August report</a>, the Department of Transportation's inspector general took exception to the way the FAA had dispensed some stimulus funds.

The database also can be searched by airport name and code, state and congressional district. Grants awarded under the stimulus act can be segregated from those awarded through the regular AIP process."		2009-10-07 18:30:05	2009-10-07 18:30:05	2009-10-07 18:30:05	1	0	1
177	Legislation Languishes in Congress as Miners Fight for their Benefits	legislation-languishes-in-congress-as-miners-fight-for-their-benefits	3	"Glen Charles, who had been a miner in West Virginia for 42 years, was diagnosed as having black lung, for which he received benefits under the Black Lung Act up to the time of his death in August 2005. Under federal law, surviving spouses of miners who die from the disease are eligible to continue receiving those benefits. But soon after Charles died, his checks stopped arriving, leaving Emma Charles, his 75-year-old widow, financially unstable.

She had to file a claim to continue receiving his benefits, which the Labor Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges denied.

Under current law, survivors receive benefits only if it is proven that a miner died of complications related to black lung. In CharlesÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ case, the death certificate listed pneumoniae as the cause of death, due to complications from pneumoconiosis - the medical term for black lung - and two other ailments. However, an administrative law judge that ruled on his widow's claim set aside the death certificate, and, in an <a href=""http://www.oalj.dol.gov/Decisions/ALJ/BLA/2006/EC_v_SLAB_FORK_COAL_CO_DI_2006BLA05920_(AUG_16_2007)_144539_CADEC_SD_files/css/EC_v_SLAB_FORK_COAL_CO_DI_2006BLA05920_(AUG_16_2007)_144539_CADEC_SD.HTM"">August 2007 decision</a>, concluded on the basis of expert witnesses who reviewed Charles' medical records that his death was not due to black lung.

The following month, Emma Charles wrote to her congressional representative and senators explaining her situation. In a <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/bl_charles1.pdf"">letter</a> to Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W. Va., she noted that he had introduced <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-1123"">legislation</a> that would allow her to receive her husbandÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s black lung benefits, which has languished in the House Labor and Education Committee since February 2007. Similar bills have been introduced four times earlier but have always died in the House.

Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºI have the understanding that you are trying to get the legislature to pass a bill that whenever a coal miner pass away and had been drawing a monthly check the widow would automatically draw a check,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ the letter reads. ""Please hurry up and get that bill passed.""

Rahall has introduced the same legislation four times since 1999, but it has never made it to a hearing. This legislation is an amendment to the Black Lung Act ""requiring eligible survivors of a miner determined to be eligible for black lung benefits to file a new claim or re-file or otherwise revalidates the miner's claim,"" according to the bill language.

The mine workers unions have also been pushing for this specific change and seem positive that the bill will pass in this legislative session. ""Now with the Democrats in both the Houses, there is a real possibility that the bill passes and it has gotten additional importance in this session,"" Grant Campbell, General Counsel for the United Mine Workers of America said.

But although unions and some coal country constituents are hopeful, congressional insiders think it's unlikely that the bill will pass in this session.

According to a senior legislative aide in the education and labor committee, they have a Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºbusy agendaÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ and there is no date set for a hearing of this bill as yet. ItÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s unlikely a date will be set.

Since the beginning of SunlightÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s congressional correspondence FOIA project, we have received scores of <a href=""http://governmentdocs.org/FOIADocs/213.pdf"">letters</a> from black lung claimants, recipients and their survivors, seeking assistance from their elected representatives with their cases. These letters are generally written to members of Congress by constituents and are forwarded on to the Department of LaborÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s Office of Administrative Law Judges to follow up on the specific queries constituents have written expressing concern with their benefit claims.

CharlesÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ widow was one such case Sunlight became aware of through our on-going FOIA project. We recently received, from the Office of Administrative Law Judges, correspondence covering the month of January 2008, which included 22 letters from constituents to various members of Congress seeking help with black lung claimes. Eleven of those were sent to Rahall."		2008-05-14 16:28:17	2008-05-14 16:30:00	2008-05-14 16:28:17	1	0	1
1780	Most Senate supporters of electronic FEC filing still disclose on paper	some-senators-who-support-e-filing-wont-voluntarily-do-so	2	"With all the foot-dragging that has accompanied legislation requiring Senate candidates to disclose campaign finance information electronically--common-sense legislation with no real opposition that comes years after the House entered the digital age--it's an oft-overlooked fact that they can already file electronically if they choose to, and a few do.

Yet of the 41 cosponsors of <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s482/show"">S. 482</a>, the bill that would require e-filing, only seven senators voluntarily file electronically; the other 34 continue to provide paper disclosure.

The Federal Election Commission has long provided an <a href=""http://disclose.nictusa.com/senate/"">obscure space</a> on its Web site to publish reports from the handful of senators who opt to file electronically--whether in the interest of transparency, convenience (eliminating the back-and-forth between paper forms and digital records saves resources of campaigns as well as the government) or, in the case of senators who have been spoken out in favor of the legislation, to practice what they preach.

The senators who have used technology to facilitate disclosure without being forced include Russ Feingold, an architect of the modern campaign finance system and the author of the bill--which he has been attempting to pass since 2003. Dianne Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, Bernie Sanders, Rick Lugar, Pat Leahy, and John Cornyn also filed electronically last election cycle.

Early this decade, as political action committees and House candidates were required to file electronically, Lugar's campaign found that not only were Senate candidates exempted from those mandates, but the Federal Election Commission actually prohibited them from availing themselves of the more efficient filing process.

""It would come up with an error message saying we couldn't do it because we were in the Senate,"" said spokesman Andy Fisher. ""You couldn't post contributions quickly with the FEC, so we had to digitize them on our own Web site,"" he added, to the great relief of a reporter who had taken to re-typing names from the paper documents for her newspaper. ""I think we saved her from carpel tunnel syndrome,"" Fisher joked. ""Finally the FEC set up an account for us, and we were the first ones.""

The program is not widely publicized, however, and some in the Senate campaign finance sphere said they were either unaware of its existence or simply had never thought to use it. In response to Sunlight Foundation questions, the office of Thad Cochran said it would begin e-filing.

""Cochran supports [S. 482] and is an original cosponsor, and now that it's been brought to our attention, there's been no reason we won't do it,"" spokesman Chris Gallegos said.

But in a world where political considerations often compete with policy positions, most of the e-filing bill's sponsors have not availed themselves of the optional filing.

""We are reluctant to file by computer until there is a statute with which a possible opponent must also comply,"" said Chambliss communications director Bronwyn Lance Chester.

All Senate candidates must disclose the same information, including contributors' names and itemized campaign expenditures. But donors then have to be manually transcribed, delaying disclosure, and expenditures remain confined to scanned images of paper documents, sometimes hundreds of pages long and useful only to those with a large amount of time on their hands--something few reporters have these days.

Senators who file on paper don't face the same level of immediate scrutiny as presidential, House and the few Senate candidates who willingly disclose their records electronically. The e-records make it easy to quickly tally, for example, that in the last two years Cornyn's campaign has spent more than $9,000 at Johnny's Half Shell, a Capitol Hill restaurant popular for fundraisers, and $16,000 at Four Seasons hotels. 

Many failed challengers have voluntarily e-filed, and a couple of other senators appear to have flirted with the idea in years past, then abandoned it. Chuck Schumer filed reports in 2003; Sheldon Whitehouse did so in 2005. Schumer is a cosponsor of the bill, as are all those who filed electronically last year except Bernie Sanders.

Some of the benefits of e-filing are negated by Senate rules that currently consider only paper reports to be official, meaning treasurers who disclose with the click of a button through a computer program also have to create a physical printout for delivery to the Senate, which then undergoes the same treatment as those of senators who didn't e-file, said Christian Hilland, a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission.

""The Secretary of the Senate receives the paper reports and they scan them in, then transmit the images electronically to the FEC. We print them out here and send them to an outside vendor, who then enters the information in an electronic format,"" Hilland said.

That means that by the time last-quarter donors are made public, the election has often long passed, the victor comfortably in office. The legislation stalled last Congressional session after John Roberts inserted what many considered a ""poison pill,"" but it is again on the Senate's calendar.

â€œThere is no good reason why the Senate continues to lag behind House and Presidential campaigns, and political action committees, when it comes to filing campaign finance reports electronically,"" Feingold said in a statement to Sunlight.  ""My campaign files our reports electronically, as well as the mandatory paper report, and while e-filing is easier and faster than filing paper reports, most importantly itâ€™s a commonsense way to make our electoral system more transparent.â€

1789	Rep. Wexler heads to think tank funded by big Democratic donor	rep-wexler-heads-to-think-tank-funded-by-big-democratic-donor	27	"Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, is resigning from Congress and accepting a job at the Center for Middle East Peace & Economic Cooperation, a nonprofit with offices in Florida and Washington, D.C., that's funded by Slim-Fast founder S. Daniel Abraham.

The Center for Middle East Peace & Economic Cooperation appears to operate on a shoestring budget, relying on annual contributions of roughly a million dollars from Abraham and listing a payroll of four, two of whom reside in Israel, according to 2008 IRS filings. In 2007, the group listed four American staffers, each making $90,000 or less each, and two Israeli consultants, making up to $198,000 each.
   
Wexler will work out of its office in downtown DC, the center told Sunlight.
  
<a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/CIDsummary.php?CID=N00002905&year=2007"">Personal financial disclosure records</a> show that Wexler accumulated tens of thousands of dollars in debt while in Congress--a study of filings from 2007 placed him in worse financial shape than all but 10 members of Congress, according to a Center for Responsive Politics <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/overview.php?type=W&year=2007&filter=C&sort=A"">analysis</a>. 

Wexler's finances have slipped slowly since he's been in office.  In 2008, his bank account held less than $15,000, and he reported credit card balances between $40,000 and $115,000 and college loans between $50,000 and $100,000. The Waxmans have three children. 

In 2007, he reported a credit card balance between $51,000 and $115,000, and student loans between $15,000 to $50,000.  The year prior, his credit card balance stood to $50,000 to $100,000, and in 2005, it was $25,000 to $65,000.

His wife draws a salary from the American Jewish Committee and, beginning last year, income from Casi, the records show. Laurie Wexler does not appear in IRS documents listing highest-paid or ""key"" employees of the American Jewish Committee, which spent $180,000 lobbying Congress last year.

As a member of Congress, Wexler was a hub for lobbyists working for other nations--far more so than any other member, including his colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee. He <a href=""http://foreignlobbying.org/legislator/Wexler%2C%20Robert/"">was contacted 173 times</a> in a recent year-long period analyzed by Sunlight, followed by Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., (105 times), a former whip, and Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., (100 times), a fellow committee member.
    
New ethics rules put somewhat of a damper on the most lucrative post-Congressional career, that of a K Street lobbyist, by requiring a one-year cooling-off period before retired House members can attempt to sway their former colleagues.

Providing a financial cushion to an important Democrat would be one way for Abraham to maximize his support to the party and to issues he cares about; he is already close to the 2009-2010 maximum contribution amounts of $30,000 each to the DCCC and DSCC.

There's no indication that Wexler plans on moving into the lobbying sphere in 2011, but former members with strong foreign ties are some of the most sought-after, and have attained some of the highest-paid contracts.

Florida senator Mel Martinez, who served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, abruptly resigned his seat this year and joined DLA Piper as a partner in its government affairs practice, serving as an <a href=""http://www.dlapiper.com/martinez_release/"">adviser</a> to clients of the international law and lobbying firm. (Martinez has not registered as a lobbyist; in the Senate, the cooling-off period is two years).

Foreign lobbyists representing Turkey, including former top House members Bob Livingston, Dennis Hastert and Dick Gephardt, reported 57 of Wexler's contacts--more than any other country--followed by 47 from lobbyists working on behalf of Azerbaijan."		2009-10-14 19:57:18	2009-10-14 19:57:18	2009-10-14 19:57:18	1	0	1

For example, <a href=""http://www.dsdlabs.com/"">DSD Laboratories</a> got a few 2005 earmarks (see <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/earmarks/preview-public-site/agencies/bureaus/accounts/earmarks/earmarkc785.html?account-id=234&amp;agency=011&amp;bureau=21&amp;earmark-id=78627&amp;web-timestamp=&amp;public-view=true"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/earmarks/preview-public-site/agencies/bureaus/accounts/earmarks/earmarkc11c.html?account-id=220&amp;agency=007&amp;bureau=20&amp;earmark-id=216670&amp;web-timestamp=&amp;public-view=true"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/earmarks/preview-public-site/agencies/bureaus/accounts/earmarks/earmark9a8f.html?account-id=220&amp;agency=007&amp;bureau=20&amp;earmark-id=216706&amp;web-timestamp=&amp;public-view=true"">here</a>  and <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/earmarks/preview-public-site/agencies/bureaus/accounts/earmarks/earmark0ca8.html?account-id=220&amp;agency=007&amp;bureau=20&amp;earmark-id=216713&amp;web-timestamp=&amp;public-view=true"">here</a> ). A check of the <a href=""http://sopr.senate.gov/"">Senate Office of Public Records site</a> shows that the firm hasn't reported or hired anyone who's reported any lobbying expenditures. However, I ran the name of the company's chairman and founder, Bart Guerreri, through OpenSecrets, and <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/search.asp?key=ennev&amp;txtName=GUERRERI,%20bart&amp;txtState=(all%20states)&amp;txtAll=Y&amp;Order=N"">came up with $68,200</a> in contributions since 1993 to a handful of members--including some who sit on the House Appropriations Committee. Running just ""DSD Lab"" in the occupation field <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/search.asp?key=4r8je&amp;txtState=(all%20states)&amp;txtEmploy=dsd%20lab&amp;txtAll=Y&amp;Order=N"">turns up</a> $110,000 to pretty much the same handful of lawmakers going back to 1993. It appears that Rep. John Murtha (<a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/search.asp?key=ffqw4&amp;txtState=(all%20states)&amp;txtCand=murtha&amp;txtEmploy=dsd%20lab&amp;txtAll=Y&amp;Order=N"">$22,000</a>) and Rep. Alan Mollohan (</a><a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/search.asp?key=xpu6a&amp;txtState=(all%20states)&amp;txtCand=mollohan&amp;txtEmploy=dsd%20lab&amp;txtAll=Y&amp;Order=N"">$16,150</a>)have gotten the bulk of the contributions, with Rep. Marty Meehan (<a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/search.asp?key=39pgb&amp;txtState=(all%20states)&amp;txtCand=meehan&amp;txtEmploy=dsd%20lab&amp;txtAll=Y&amp;Order=N"">$14,000</a>) coming in third. If I were curious about who inserted each earmark for DSD Laboratories, I might begin by asking those three members.

It also occurs to me that maybe the Earmark Database could provide fodder for a good distributed research project--how many earmark beneficiaries either hired lobbyists or had employees who made contributions to members of Congress. I don't know whether waiting for 2008 data makes more sense than starting with the 2005 numbers."		2007-04-05 18:28:05	2007-04-05 18:35:47	2007-04-05 18:28:05	1	0	1
180	Following Hastert Through the Revolving Door	following-hastert-through-the-revolving-door	3	"Former House Speaker Dennis Hastert's days raising money for his political campaigns might come in handy when he sits down with the clients of his new employer, law and lobbying firm Dickstein  Shapiro LLP.

The firm has a long list of clients in the health care sector -- an industry that provided generous support for Hastert's  during his time in Congress.

According to lobbying reports filed by the Senate Office of Public Records and the <a href=""http://www.dicksteinshapiro.com/experience/representativeclients/"">firmÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s website</a>, Dickstein Shapiro's current and past clients include about a dozen pharmaceutical or health care companies. The health care sector has been the number two contributor to Hastert over the years. Individuals and political action committees associated with the industry have contributed close to $4 million to his campaigns since 1989 when he was first elected to Congress, according to campaign finance records from the <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00004781"">Center for Responsive Politics</a>. Many of the firm's clients lobbied on health care issues that include Medicare,  Medicaid, and health care research.  Budgetary and appropriations issues were also cited.

Hastert, who resigned last November, was the longest serving Republican Speaker, a post he held from the end of the short tenure of Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., in Dec. 1998 until January 2007, when Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., replaced him.

The lobbying firm made an announcement on Saturday, May 31, that he was signing on for a second Washington career. According to a <a href=""http://www.rollcall.com/news/25467-1.html""><em>Roll Call</em> article</a>, Hastert is joining the firm with one of his senior congressional staffers.

Dickstein Shapiro's practice boasts a number of energy firms, including include Duke Energy, Peabody Energy and the Electric Power Supply Association among other electric utility companies. During his congressional career, Hastert took in close to $2 million in contributions from employees, their family members, and PACs in the energy and natural resources sector.

AT&amp;T was Hastert's top contributor over his career, giving close to $122,000 to his various campaigns. The telecommunications giant is also one of Dickstein's clients, according to the company's Web site, though the the firm apparently doesn't lobby for AT&amp;T, a search of records from the <a href=""http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=choosefields"">Senate Office of Public Records</a> shows.

181	A little digging into FEC disclosures	a-little-digging	2	"A while back, Jim Geraghty of the <a href=""http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/"">Campaign Spot</a> wrote a pair of interesting posts, the <a href=""http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGU1YzQyODA5MTI3OGQ4YzU4NTc0ZmRkNDhkNzI4MzA="">first</a> noting that, during his <a href=""http://opensecrets.org/politicians/alsorun.php?cid=N00009638&amp;cycle=2000"">2000 campaign</a> to unseat Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., Barack Obama took ""on credit card debt to finance his effort,"" while the <a href=""http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MTNjNThhZDk0MDQ3NTJmMTJmZjkyMDkxOWJjODFiZTc="">second</a> raised additional questions but seemed to put the credit card issue to rest, by quoting a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/03/us/politics/03obama.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;fta=y&amp;oref=login"">New York Times article</a> that looked at the campaign committee's finances:
<blockquote>When Mr. Obama decided to run for Congress in 2000 against the former Black Panther Bobby Rush, he used a $9,500 personal loan to help finance the campaign. When he lost, he found himself broke and fielding questions from the Federal Election Commission about his campaign finances. He later had to lend his campaign committee $11,100 more to cover refunds to donors who had inadvertently given too much.

It took him two years to repay his own loans, mostly with small checks from black executives who agreed to help him prepare for another run.</blockquote>
In his first post, Geraghty also <a href=""http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGU1YzQyODA5MTI3OGQ4YzU4NTc0ZmRkNDhkNzI4MzA="">quotes </a> a book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Obama-Promise-Power-David-Mendell/dp/0060858214/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1212591817&amp;sr=8-1"">Obama: From Promise to Power</a>, by <em>Chicago Tribune</em> reporter David Mendell, who writes of the couple's finances some time after Obama's 2000 run for Congress: ""He had maxed out his credit card, partly on campaign expenses, and the couple were both repaying student loans from Harvard.""

Federal Election Commission records seem contradict both the <em>Times</em> story and the book passage.

Take the issue of maxing out the credit card, partly on campaign expenses. Federal election regulations require candidates, when they loan money to their committee, to specify whether the funds are coming from personal sources (defined <a href=""&lt;br &gt;&lt;/a&gt; http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/janqtr/pdf/11cfr100.33.pdf"">here</a> as being either assets or income) or from a lender, whether it's a financial institution or a friend. The 2000 Obama campaign started receiving letters in July 2001 -- here's <a href=""http://images.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?_21037243015+0"">one example</a> -- from the FEC asking for clarification on the source of the loans to the campaign. The letter says, in part,

<blockquote>If the candidate borrowed the funds from a lending institution or some other source, please provide the name of the lending institution and the complete terms of the loan.</blockquote>

The <a href=""http://images.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?_22992694638+0"">amended, year-end disclosure report for 2000</a>, filed on Nov. 22, 2002 notes, as several of the other filings do, that the source of the loans was personal funds--not from a lending institution (a credit card company would certainly count as such). On pages 13 and 14 the disclosure, the reports state that Obama made two, $2,000 loans to his committee, the first on Jan. 25, 2000 and the second on Feb. 22, 2000, both from personal funds, and both to be repaid at a 7 percent interest rate. Page 15 shows a third loan, of $5,500, made on March 21, 2000, also carrying a 7 percent interest rate. Though the notation that the loan is from ""personal funds"" is missing, there's no indication that the $5,500 was charged to a credit card. 

The Obama 2000 committee did have credit cards of its own, the disclosures show, and there were outstanding balances on them, but that wouldn't have had any impact on Obama's credit card bills (and certainly wouldn't max them out). It's certainly possible that Obama ran up credit card debt for personal expenses while running for office. Campaigning cuts into the time candidates would otherwise devote to earning a living, which is one reason why so many of our elected officials come from financially comfortable backgrounds. And it's also possible that Obama charged legitimate campaign expenses to his personal credit card and then failed to get reimbursed from the campaign for the items, though it's not clear why he would do that.

I'll take a look at the repayment of the loans a bit later."		2008-06-20 15:41:51	2008-06-20 15:41:51	2008-06-20 15:41:51	1	0	1
1814	Recovery.gov recipient data just in	recovery-gov-recipient-data-just-in	2	"<a href=""http://www.recovery.gov"">Recovery.gov</a> posted information today showing that 30,383 jobs have been created or saved by the federal contracts that have been awarded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. So far, $16 billion has been disbursed by 9,100 contracts. The federal government is spending more than $525,000 spent on every job they saved or created.

The release covers just a sliver of stimulus spending: Most recovery money is in the form of grants and loans to the states; data from that spending--including recipient and jobs data--will be available at the end of October. So far, federal contracts make only about two percent of the $787 billion going out as part of the recovery process. According to the data, most jobs (4,695) have been created or saved in Colorado which received more then $48 million in stimulus finds.

As with the agency reports that Recovery.gov put online a few weeks ago, this time too, the Web site offers aÂ  user-friendly map that can be searched by zip code or by state, and allows users to download the data from their searches.

1817	Bailout beneficiaries give hidden 'bundles' to House Committee overseeing industry reform	bailout-beneficiaries-give-hidden-bundles-to-house-committee-overseeing-industry-reform	27	"As the House Financial Services Committee begins to consider <a href=""http://financialservices.house.gov/Key_Issues/Financial_Regulatory_Reform/Financial_Regulatory_Reform.html"">financial industry reform legislation</a> (discussion drafts started appearing on the committee's Web site on Sept. 25), will we see the same kind of <a href=""http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/10/01/hidden-%E2%80%98bundles%E2%80%99-of-lobbyist-giving-show-full-court-press-by-health-care-donors/"">hidden ""bundles""</a> flowing to members that we saw going to key members of the Senate Finance Committee from health care interests and their lobbyists? That one-two punch flooded Sen. Max Baucus' campaign coffers with more than <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lm_memsclients.php?id=N00004643"">$450,000</a> from 11 health care interests--and 109 lobbyists who represented them--from Jan. 2007 through the end of June, 2009.

To date, we 've found far fewer of these contribution clusters--in which outside lobbyists and their clients both donate to the same member of Congress--coming from interests in the financial sector. Of the 71 members of the House Financial Services Committee, 55 had a contribution cluster, and of those, only 34 had more than one. Sunlight and the Center for Responsive Politics will begin examining data from the third quarter to see whether this pattern holds, or whether all the <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Entertainment_Type/financial/"">financial services fundraisers</a> we've tracked at Political Party Time have boosted the number of clusters.

But some patterns have emerged already. Beneficiaries of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act--the bailout that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP--dominated the list of clients in our survey. Goldman Sachs and lobbyists that represent it were the biggest source of clusters; both contributed to 16 members of the committee, followed by Bank of America (15), J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (14) and Citigroup, accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young and Morgan Stanley (all tied with 12). Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America acquired in 2008, had ten clusters--if you combine those with its new parent, Bank of America rises to the top of the list.

Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., had the most client/lobbyist pairings from financial industry interests--15 in all, followed by the committee chair, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., (13) and Rep. Dan Maffei, D-N.Y., (11).

Below are lists of the top clusterers and the top clusterees (that is, the clients who with their outside lobbyists gave to the most members, and the members who were the focus of the most client/outside lobbyist giving).

1837	Murtha challenger trounces incumbent in fundraising; outraises Boehner and Pelosi too	murtha-challenger-trounces-boehner-pelosi-and-embattled-murtha	2	"While the ethics scandals that have multiplied around top fundraisers and earmark recipients of Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., have yet to involve him directly, he now faces a challenge from a different direction: A well-financed opponent.

William Russell, the Republican aiming to do battle with Murtha in the general election, trounced the longtime legislator with an astonishing $2 million in campaign contributions raised--more than House leaders John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi, more than double that of the next-highest grossing challenger, and nearly three times that of Murtha's haul of $712,000, the most recent campaign finance disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission show.

While almost 40 percent of Murtha's take came from political action committees, Russell's haul came almost entirely from individuals--and without help from the National Republican Congressional Committee. The contributions are largely from out-of-state, indicating that the support may be more about displacing Murtha.

The fundraising total is an indicator that Murtha faces a serious challenge this November, but Russell is doing more than stockpiling a dangerous warchest: With more than a year from the election, he has mounted an active campaign and spent nearly as much as he's raised.

Murtha, chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, has taken heat for his ties to defense companies, whose PACs provide him with more support than those from any other sector, and for the earmarks he's steered to contributors. One of his top contributors over his career, the lobbying firm PMA Group--which specialized in getting defense earmarks and contracts for its clients--disbanded after the FBI raided its offices; it remains under investigation.

1863	Foster, now facing Hastert's son, still dipping into personal wealth	foster-now-facing-hasterts-son-still-dipping-into-personal-wealth	27	"A bid by the son of longtime House Majority Leader Dennis Hastert to defeat the man who replaced his father is far from a sure thing, but if nothing else, a respectable <a href=""http://fec.gov/DisclosureSearch/HSRefreshCandList.do?category=disH&amp;stateName=IL&amp;congressId=14&amp;election_yr=2010"">showing</a> by the younger Hastert could keep the incumbent, Bill Foster, from replenishing his personal bank account.

The abrupt resignation of the elder Hastert in 2008 triggered a special election that was characterized by the exceptional reliance on personal funds: Businessman and scientist Bill Foster loaned his campaign two million dollars to defeat Jim Oberweis, a dairy-products magnate who blew through $3.8 million in personal funds vying for the seat--after a string of failed bids for the Senate and Illinois governorship.

Foster, a Democrat in a heavily Republican district, retained his seat in the regular 2008 election and recouped half of his self-funding, then loaned himself another $45,000 earlier this year. Now, the Hastert family is back in the game, with Ethan Hastert keeping him on guard by raising $313,000. Foster had a much bigger take, at $1.1 million, but his campaign committee still owes him $900,000 between last year's debt and this year's smaller outstanding loan.

Foster is the 18th-richest member of the House, according to a Center for Responsive Politics <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00029139&amp;cycle=2010"">analysis</a> of personal financial disclosures."		2009-10-20 18:17:31	2009-10-20 18:17:31	2009-10-20 18:17:31	1	0	1
187	Did Congress write a prescription for Chantix?	did-congress-write-a-prescription-for-chantix	3	"<a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=5192891&amp;page=1)"">Last week</a>, some members of Congress  called for an immediate suspension of a drug testing program administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs after <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/video/playerIndex?id=5182533"">ABC News</a> and the <a href=""http://www.washtimes.com/news/2008/jun/17/test-nearly-lethal-veteran-says/"">Washington Times</a> reported that one of the side effects a specific drug that helps kick the smoking habit could possibly be suicide.

The drug Chantix, manufactured by Pfizer, has been used in programs by the Department of Veterans Affairs as a smoking cessation drug. The ABC report revealed that, ""mentally distressed veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan are being recruited for government tests on pharmaceutical drugs linked to suicide and other violent side effects.""

But did Congress authorize the tests?

The recently passed <a href=""http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.05658:"">Defense Authorization Bill</a> for fiscal year 2009 included a number of preventive health care programs. According to information posted on the House Speaker Nancy PelosiÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s <a href=""http://www.speaker.gov/legislation?id=0209"">Web site</a>, one of those is ""a smoking cessation program, including classes and nicotine replacement including classes and nicotine replacement.""

<a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h110-5658"">Language</a> in the 2009 Defense Authorization Act requires the Secretary of Defense to create a smoking cessation program under which all veterans would be eligible to receive rebates to help them quit smoking. Section 713 of the bill reads, Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºThe program would include the availability of a pharmaceutical used for smoking cessation by prescription at no cost.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹

Since 2007, Pfizer has been <a href=""http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=viewFilingImage"">lobbying</a> the House, the Senate and the Department of Veterans Affairs on issues related to Defense authorization and appropriations, according to lobbying forms filed with the Senate Office of Public Records.

Although a staffer for the Armed Services Committee that oversees the program said that the Department of Defense would use only drugs that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, to date the FDA appears to have approved only one other drug--<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/womens/medicinecharts/smoking.html"">Zyban</a>, which has a longer list of side effects than Chantix.

1874	Why the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reported spending so much on lobbying	why-the-u-s-chamber-of-commerce-reports-spending-so-much-on-lobbying	27	"The <a href=""http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/pdfform.aspx?id=300209382"">latest filing</a> from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that the trade association, which represents <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2009/10/us-chamber-caves-membership-numbers"">300,000</a> members--mostly businesses--spent a whopping $34,690,000 on lobbying in the third quarter of 2009. So what does this number actually mean? What are they spending their money on?

Part of it was spent on other lobbying firms. Outside lobbyists reported receiving $508,100 from the Chamber to lobby (that number should really be $510,000--one firm <a href=""http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=8ec6e2e7-542b-4433-b79b-9f03604f9e05"">didn't round</a> to the nearest $10,000) in the third quarter (slightly less than the $526,000 spent in the second quarter, when the Chamber reported spending a lusty but much lower total of $7,430,000). So that still leaves us with $34,180,000.

It's third quarter report shows 81 in-house lobbyists. That works out to $421,975 per lobbyist. For three months work. I doubt they're being paid that much.

The Chamber elects to report how much it spends on lobbying using section 162(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, which says that businesses can't deduct lobbying expenses and then defines what lobbying is. Here's the IRS' <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000162----000-.html"">definition</a> of lobbying:

<blockquote><strong>(A)</strong> influencing legislation,
<strong>(B)</strong> participation in, or intervention in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office,
<strong>(C)</strong> any attempt to influence the general public, or segments thereof, with respect to elections, legislative matters, or referendums, or
<strong>(D)</strong> any direct communication with a covered executive branch official in an attempt to influence the official actions or positions of such official. </blockquote>

It's letter C that likely explains the huge upsurge in spending: the Chamber <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125236911298191113.html#mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLTopStories"">has launched</a> a lot of <a href=""http://blog.taragana.com/n/chamber-of-commerce-begins-national-ad-campaign-hitting-obama-plans-for-health-care-overhaul-137073/"">issues ads</a>; I'll call them tomorrow to make sure. 

How much they're spending on ads relative to lobbyists is anyone's guess--but should be disclosed. And how one can compare the nearly $35 million that the Chamber discloses on its reports to the $776,000 that the <a href=""http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=f545490e-1a5f-471e-a57c-6136732d7e10"">Service Employees International Union</a> discloses is beyond me. The SEIU uses the Lobbying Disclosure Act definition of lobbying, which does not include spending on efforts to influence the general public. 

For those interested in plunging deeper into lobbying disclosure rules, via Googlebooks comes <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=DhL_4k4X5lEC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=reporting+amounts+under+section+162%28e%29+of+the+internal+revenue+code&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k1ai4toqrf&amp;sig=PQAV4kTvfmcULWzVMYhaQ1r0m8A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NnLfSofRCYSX8Abv8O1j&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CAwQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false"">this book</a> from the American Bar Association on lobbying -- the link goes to the chapter on 162(e).

1875	Scaled-down missile defense system comes after ramped-up lobbying effort	scaled-down-missile-defense-system-comes-after-ramped-up-lobbying-effort	27	"Lobbyists for the nation of Poland marked a win today as the country expressed relief at a scaled down US-sponsored missile shield, as the Associated Press <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/21/AR2009102100509.html?hpid=moreheadlines"">reported</a>, a turning point in negotiations between the countries in which Poland relied not just on diplomats, but on K Street lobbyists paid hundreds of thousands of dollars , too. The Obama administration last month agreed to dramatically scale down an Eastern European defense system that offended Russia and put a wary Poland on edge.Â  The Bush plan would have used Poland as a potential launching point for missiles intercepting projectiles from Iran, but some viewed its ulterior target at Russia.

Talks between the US and Poland on a missile defense system took on an unexpected urgency when Russian tanks rolled in to Georgia in a territorial dispute last year. <a href=""http://foreignlobbying.org/client/Embassy%20of%20Poland/"">Polish lobbyists met 70 times</a> with the Administration and 38 times with House of Representatives and Senate staff between June and November to negotiate an arrangement under which the United States would install a missile defense system in Poland, ostensibly to deter threats from Iran, according to Department of Justice records analyzed by the Sunlight Foundation and ProPublica and available at <a href=""http://www.ForeignLobbying.org"">ForeignLobbying.org</a>. Such diplomacy can be a zero-sum game, however: Russia claimed the system was aimed at it and declared that installation â€œcould not go unpunished,â€ meaning that striking a deal with one Eastern European country would deal a blow to relations with its larger neighbor.Â  In May, funding for the system was stripped by House Democrats who did not view Iran as an imminent threat.

The negotiations played out against the backdrop of the US presidential campaign; while then-candidate Barack Obama criticized the defense system, the Polish foreign minister met with his opponent, Sen. John McCain, in September. Making as many as eight contacts in a day that month, Polish lobbyists communicated with key committees and members in the House and Senate and with then-deputy assistant secretary of defense for Europe and NATO policy Dan Fata, who left government to work for international lobby shop the Cohen Group (and has since publicly advocated for the missile base), and Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried, a former ambassador to Poland.

With the reevaluation of the Eastern European defense systemâ€”which may be based off ships rather than mainland basesâ€”Poland can consider its $203,000 in lobbying fees a successful investment. Vice President Joe Biden travelled to Poland with a contingent of other former Soviet bloc countries, many of whose relationships with Russia remain icy.

Polandâ€™s lobbyists were also active during the same time period addressing a House resolution calling on its government to make â€œimmediate and just restitution of, or compensation for, property illegally confiscated during the last century by Nazi and Communist regimes.â€"		2009-10-21 20:28:05	2009-10-21 20:28:05	2009-10-21 20:28:05	1	0	1
188	Birnbaum: Bank of America lobbyists wrote parts of bank bail out bill	birnbaum-bank-of-america-lobbyists-wrote-parts-of-bank-bail-out-bill	2	"Jeffrey Birnbaum, writing in the Washington Post, <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/24/AR2008062401389.html"">reports</a> lobbyists wrote key portions of the mortgage bailout bill:

<blockquote>Credit Suisse, a large investment bank heavily invested in mortgage-backed securities, proposed allowing hundreds of thousands of homeowners to refinance their mortgages with lower-cost government-insured loans, relieving financial institutions of the troubled debt.

After the bank proposed this to Congress in January, it became known as the ""Credit Suisse plan"" among congressional staffers and lobbyists. It later formed the basis of housing provisions in both the House and Senate.

Bank of America, which is acquiring Countrywide Financial, the country's largest mortgage lender, followed with a similar and more detailed proposal, principal negotiators on the legislation said.

In approaching congressional aides, the lobbyists suggested that banks take less than full payment for the distressed loans on their books. But the measures would allow financial institutions to get cash out of foreclosed properties that would otherwise sit on their books as dead weight.

Since the new loans would be guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), taxpayers would ultimately pay for defaults. The Congressional Budget Office projected that this could cost $1.7 billon over five years.</blockquote>

Last Friday, Stephen Spruiell of National Review <a href=""http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ODJkN2Q3NTY0MjAwYjJlNTY0NTJmMWEzZTI1OGZjZTg="">posted an internal document</a> from Bank of America -- it looks more like an explanation of Dodd-Shelby's purpose and some talking points for selling it rather than legislative language, but Spruiell's assertion -- ""This discussion document (dated March 11, 2008) would appear to support the contention that BofA essentially wrote the bailout section of the bill. Almost all of BofA's preferences are mirrored in the Dodd-Shelby legislation.""

Given that Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., <a href=""http://thenextright.com/soren-dayton/shouldnt-the-senate-banking-chair-know-interest-rates"">doesn't know what the interest rates are</a>, it's probably better that he's not writing the bills anyway. (Dodd, of course, got a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/washington/18dodd.html?_r=1&oref=slogin"">preferential mortgage</a> from Countrywide Financial, which Bank of America is acquiring.)

I'm surprised that Glenn Reynolds, who's been <a href=""http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/archives2/020871.php"">all</a> over <a href=""http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/archives2/020860.php"">this</a> <a href=""http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/archives2/020843.php"">story</a>, didn't pick up on this one.

In any case, it certainly wasn't intended as a dig -- he's been link central on the Countrywide story, one that I don't think we've seen the end of yet (far from it)."		2008-06-26 03:25:42	2008-06-26 16:29:43	2008-06-26 03:25:42	1	0	1
1891	Fighting net neutrality, telecom companies, outside lobbyists, cluster contributions to members of Congress	fighting-net-neutrality-telecom-companies-outside-lobbyists-cluster-contributions-to-members-of-congress	2	"While the Federal Communications Commission <a href=""http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j7zvEbTdrfaVvQLIKpy5dy4bmufQD9BG6AKO0"">considers the first steps</a> toward ensuring net neutrality--making certain that broadband providers do not discriminate against high traffic sites--the telecom firms that would be affected by the rules and their trade groups have been swamping Congress with a one-two punch of campaign contributions from the companies and their registered lobbyists. Some 244 members of Congress were the beneficiaries of these contribution clusters--totaling more than $9.4 million--from January 2007 to June 2009, an investigative collaboration of the Sunlight Foundation and the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org"">Center for Responsive Politics</a> has found. Telecom interests and their lobbyists engaged in more clustered giving than any industry save pharmaceuticals.

Overall, the top recipient of the largess was Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who took in $894,379 (many of those contributions were directed to his 2008 presidential campaign). The telecom interests also targeted House and Senate leaders: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., was next with $341,089, followed by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. ($275,275), Senate Finance Committee chair Max Baucus, D-Mont. ($248,999) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ($198,972).

Broadband providers have <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/21/AR2009102103944.html"">attempted to enlist members of Congress</a> in an effort to block action on net neutrality rules by the FCC. Verizon and AT&amp;T have been <a href=""http://www.telegeography.com/cu/article.php?article_id=30617"">particularly active</a> in this effort; they also were the sources of all the clustered contributions among broadband providers, with AT&amp;T and its outside lobbyists combining to give to 110 members, followed by Comcast (105 members) and Verizon (96 members).

The analysis was based on a survey of giving by eight large broadband providers and two trade associations that represent them, all of which have disclosed lobbying on net neutrality issues. We looked for outside lobbyists of these interests who contributed to the same members of Congress as their clients had. For example, 55 lobbyists who reported AT&amp;T as a client collectively contributed <span style=""color: #000000;"">$170,800 to Sen. John McCain; AT&amp;T's employees, their family members, and its political action committee contributed </span><span style=""color: #000000;"">$206,438 to McCain. The greater the number of such clusters coming from a particular interest, the more likely it is that that member is being targeted by the interest. </span>

As noted &lt;a href=""http://thehill.com/hillicon-valley/605-technology/64373-report-telecom-firms-shower-lamakers-with-money-in-net-neutrality-fight""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for example, McCain introduced legislation today to block the FCC from writing net neutrality regulations.

As Congress <a href=""http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=cqmidday-000003212381"">considers legislation</a> that would codify net neutrality into law, telecom firms are hoping to cut a better deal on Capitol Hill than they are likely to get from the FCC.

Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºMost schools make it clear to students they are using this technology and it scares students.

The Mistral Group also includes <span lang=""EN"">Karil International Marketing Ltd., a company based in Israel. WhatÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s interesting is that they are headed by Eyal Banai who was with the defense attachÃ¢Ë†Å¡Ã‚Â© at the Embassy of Israel.

1903	Entering digital age an expensive proposition for GOP	entering-digital-age-an-expensive-proposition-for-gop	27	"The Republican National Committee shelled out $1.4 million dollars over the last six months for Web sites and services, much of which was spent on GOP.com, the party's major Web presence that was unveiled this month, new Federal Election Commission expense reports show.

The figure is far higher than what experts estimate it should have cost, and five times the amount its Democratic counterpart spent to host and maintain Democrats.org.

The biggest disparity seems to be bandwidth costs--the RNC paid Smartech Corp., a Republican-focused hosting firm, more than a million dollars, plus $22,000 to Eloqua, compared to the DNC's $203,000 to Sprint, Switch and Data and Servint Corp.--despite the fact that the two sites' traffic, which determines bandwidth usage and, largely, hosting costs, was the same.

But the design of the site itself was costly, too. In the months prior to the October 13 launch of GOP.com, the committee paid $328,000 to 11 firms for Web development. (The Democrats, which did not completely overhaul their site during that time period, spent $45,000 on Web development.)

And when the GOP's graphics-laden product was unveiled, many of the main sections appeared missing or broken, including one advertised as listing future party leaders, which showed up blank.

""It feels as though too much focus has been placed on flashy features to the detriment of usability,"" said Jamie Newell of Washington-based 7AZ Web Design. The site's reliance on a mish-mash of technologies make it inaccessible to some, including those on mobile devices, he added, ""making it impossible to navigate the site and ultimately hindering the message they are trying to deliver.""

The text that fills the site, indeed, seemed almost an afterthought. The second-to-last item on the <a href=""http://www.gop.com/index.php/learn/accomplishment/"">accomplishment page</a> ends in 2004, where one of the last items is ""Operation Iraqi Freedom.""

""Considering the significant resources they invested, more focus should have been placed on the quality of the content,"" Newell said.

For all the funds poured into GOP.com, not all of the features lasted more than a day. A blog by Michael Steele titled ""What Up?""--whose first entry on the belated Web presence read,<a href=""http://www.gop.com/index.php/chairman_steele/""> ""The Internet has been around for a while, now""-</a>-was abruptly renamed, having becoming the subject of mockery on the Web. Visitors to the home page were originally greeted by a miniature Steele making a video introduction, but that, too, was soon removed.

The site features a plethora of technology-related buzzwords, but not always in their appropriate context. It touts itself as an ""open platform"" and solicits ""volunteer coders"" to contribute features to the Web site, but submitting a volunteer contact form yields no response.

""If they had anyone familiar with technology on the inside, they could have told them that much money wasn't necessary,"" a Democratic National Committee source who works with new media said. ""It's lots of money for a small return."" And they seem to have created a Web presence not so much to advance specific policy goals, but for the sake of having one, he added. ""I can't see how this would build their long-term organizing efforts. They don't have a strategy for actually providing knowledge and creating value with this stuff.""

Smartech declined to provide details on its million-dollar bill. The RNC did not respond to repeated requests for information.

1909	Correction: Fees for Livingston Group corrected in FLIT	flit-correction	2	"Due to a data entry error, the Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker contained duplicate entries for fees paid to the Livingston Group by some its clients. We have eliminated the duplicate records. Some of the totals we reported in the two main stories that accompanied the release of the database have changed:
<ul>
	<li> The Livingston Groupâ€™s earnings from fees paid by its foreign clients has been changed to $3.1 million;</li>
	<li>The total money that various foreign entities reported spending in 2008 on lobbyists changes from $87 million to $85 million;</li>
	<li>Turkeyâ€™s spending on lobbying stands corrected at $3.5 million.</li>
</ul>
Although every effort was made to double check these numbers, we did miss 28 duplicates among the tens of thousands of records.

192	Curious Career of McCain Fundraiser	curious-career-of-mccain-fundraiser	18	"Last week, <a href=""http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/07/mccain_moneyraiser.php"">Talking Points Memo</a> reported that one of John McCainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top fundraisers, <a href=""http://www.cassidy.com/bios/biodetail.asp?Id=95&amp;Office=dc"">Juan Carlos Benitez</a>, has direct ties to <a href=""http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Jack_Abramoff"">Jack Abramoff</a>, and now works with Cassidy &amp; Associates, a Washington, D.C., lobbying firm. McCainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s campaign <a href=""http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/fundraisers.htm"">listed</a> Benitez as having raised between $50,000 to $100,000.

According to the lobbying forms filed with the Senate Office of Public Records Benitez is currently registered to lobby for the Iraqi Red Crescent Organization and lobbied on the Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 2009 pushing for additional funding for Iraq. In 2008 he is also registered to lobby on behalf of Univision Communications and the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust.

In earlier years he has lobbied for <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Commonwealth+of+the+N+Mariana+Islands&amp;year=2004"">Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands</a>, and <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Wal-Mart+Stores&amp;year=2004"">Wal-Mart</a>, among others.

And as of May of 2007, one of his responsibilities at Cassidy was handling the firmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account with Equatorial Guinea, a small yet oil-rich African nation, according to <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/news/outfront/2007/05/extreme_makeover.html"">Mother Jones</a>. Last month, <a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2193870"">Peter Maass</a> writing at Slate.com, named Equatorial GuineaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s president, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teodoro_Obiang_Nguema_Mbasogo"">Teodoro Obiang</a>, AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worst dictator. <a href=""http://www.harpers.org/archive/2007/07/0081591"">Ken Silverstein</a>, writing in the June 2007 edition of HarperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Magazine, interviewed Cassidy staffers who bragged to him that through an aggressive media strategy and by organizing trips to the country for congressional staffers, they were able to knock Obiang out of <a href=""http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2007/edition_02-11-2007/Dictators"">Parade Magazine</a>Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s annual Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who Is the WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Worst Dictator?Ã¢â‚¬Â top ten listing. Before CassidyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s campaign the strongman ranked sixth. The <a href=""http://www.parade.com/dictators/2008/index.jsp"">2008 list</a> has him at 13.

According to <a href=""http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/07/mccain_moneyraiser.php"">TPM</a>, in 2001, Abramoff helped Benitez get a gig at the <a href=""http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/osc/"">Department of Justice as the Special Council for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices</a>, whose job it was to monitor and prosecute sweatshops among other things. Why would Abramoff want his friend in such a position? The local government of the <a href=""http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/ref/cnmi.php"">Mariana Islands</a>, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, was paying Abramoff millions of dollars to protect their sweatshop racket. Mariana Island interests paid Abramoff $600,000 in 2002. DOJ took no action against the sweatshops that year, TPM reports

In June 2003, Benitez <a href=""http://www.cassidy.com/press/pressdetail.asp?Id=23"">joined</a> Cassidy &amp; Associates as a senior vice president. The firmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s <a href=""http://www.cassidy.com/press/pressdetail.asp?Id=23"">press release </a>announcing BenitezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hire stated that he Ã¢â‚¬Å“will assist the U.S. territories in maneuvering through the regulatory maze existing in Washington.Ã¢â‚¬Â Benitez had another direct connection to U.S. territories in the Pacific, his Guam-born wife <a href=""http://www.yokwe.net/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=319"">Ramona Jones</a>. In February 2003, the U.S. Department of the Interior <a href=""http://www.doi.gov/oia/press/2003/RamonaJones.htm"">appointed</a> Jones as the Special Advisor for Economic Policy for the Insular Areas, where she was specifically tasked with finding ways to improve the economic conditions in Guam, the Marianas and other U.S. territories.

Last Friday, I checked some summary data on <a href=""http://www.usaspending.gov"">USAspending.gov</a> -- the page I was looking at is <a href=""http://www.usaspending.gov/faads/tables.php?reptype=p&amp;tabtype=t1&amp;subtype=atf&amp;rowtype=c"">here</a>, trying to calculate per capita spending by state. Note that in 2009, the federal government sent out $970 billion in grants, loans, insurance, and direct payment, but couldn't tell you which state some $460 billion of the money went to (blank or invalid entries--perhaps the latter include states like Pennsyljersey, Califoregon and West Dakota). That was actually an improvement over 2008, when $363 billion out of a little less than $499 billion couldn't be placed in a state; 2007 wasn't much better.

Will health care data be more timely and complete?

194	Pro Publica gets Stevens indictment online	pro-publica-gets-stevens-indictment-online	2	"It's available <a href=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/propublica/assets/docs/stevens_indictment_080729.pdf"">here</a>. Looks mostly like it concerns omissions from Stevens' personal financial disclosure forms, though the big ticket item is Stevens' help for Veco Corporation allegedly in exchange for gifts. When Sunlight released our <a href=""http://fortune535.sunlightprojects.org/"">Fortune 535</a> project on the personal financial disclosures, we said, ""...take what follows with a boulder-sized grain of salt: It's all based on information from the seriously flawed disclosure system used by members of Congress."" 

One question I have: A lot of the alleged malfeasance revolves around a Stevens personal residence, the Girdwood residence or, as Stevens called it, ""the chalet."" Obviously accepting a gift for the home would have to be reported, but the indictment also seems to be suggesting (I'm not sure it's suggesting this) that these gifts were in fact gifts and couldn't have been loans because:

<blockquote>51. The first page of the 2001 Financial Disclosure Form also contained the following
question, followed by boxes for ""YES"" and ""NO"":

Did you, your spouse, or dependent child have any reportable liability (more than $10,000) in the reporting period? If yes, Complete and Attach PART VII.

On the 2001 Financial Disclosure Form, STEVENS checked the ""NO"" box, and did not attach a
completed Part VII form. </blockquote>

Again, I'm not sure, but from my quick read of the indictment, it appears that the government is suggesting that when Stevens says he has no liabilities of more than $10,000, that means the hundreds of thousands of dollars Stevens is alleged to have received as benefits from VECO couldn't possibly have been loans. But if (and for the record, I doubt this is likely), <strong>if</strong> Stevens was borrowing money, labor and materials to renovate a residence from VECO rather than accepting it as a gift, I'm not sure Stevens would have to report it under current personal financial disclosure rules, which <a href=""http://ethics.senate.gov/downloads/pdffiles/manual.pdf"">say</a>,

<blockquote>property which is held or maintained solely for recreational or personal purposes does not have to be reported.... (p. 131) 

and

Mortgages secured by a personal residence (including secondary residences) that are not used for rental purposes do not have to be disclosed. (p. 136)</blockquote> 

Interestingly, the same passage goes on to say, ""Personal loans secured by motor vehicles, household furniture, or appliances do not have to be disclosed, as long as the indebtedness does not exceed the purchase price of the item."" Stevens is accused of having accepted a car swap and household furnishings and not reporting them as gifts. 

Suppose there was some understanding Stevens would repay Veco or its CEO, Bill Allen, for the home repairs, the car swap, the furniture and so on -- shouldn't the public know of those potential conflicts of interest? The indictment reminds us, 

<blockquote>The primary purpose of the yearly Financial Disclosure Forms is to disclose, monitor and deter conflicts of interest, thereby maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the United States Senate and its Members. Because the yearly Financial Disclosure Forms require public disclosure of financial information by each Member of the United States Senate, such as income, assets, gifts, financial interests, and liabilities, the Forms provide the public at large, including the voters of a particular state, with the information necessary to allow the public to evaluate and consider official conduct by a Member of the United States Senate in light of that Member's private finances.</blockquote>

Do the current disclosure requirements adequately ""deter conflicts of interest, thereby maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the United States Senate and its Members,"" if they exempt personal residences, mortgages, car loans and so on from public view?

<blockquote>Taxpayers for Common Sense has released the last four years of earmark data for Alaska to help create an understanding of how powerful Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK) has remained as an appropriator. The new research has found that Senator Stevens has secured or played a significant role in securing more than 891 earmarks worth $3.2 billion, which comes to $4,872 per capita over the last four years. This is more than 18 times the national average of $263 per capita for the same four years.

This number is higher than the numbers reported by others because TCS researchers have obtained the locations of many of the defense earmarks which typically are not disclosed.</blockquote>

In other words, he brought home steaming heaps of pork. 

Taxpayers for Common Sense do more digging on earmarks than anyone else -- worth noting that their figures on Stevens were cited by the Post in the above-linked report.

How much time do members spend evaluating these requests? An hour? Less? More? How much due diligence does a member put into requesting an earmark? And how much time, relative to earmarks, do members devote to issues like health care or social security or Medicare or the tax code or even simply the big ticket items in the appropriations bills they're loading up with favors? Can they see the forest for the earmarked trees?"		2008-07-31 15:16:04	2008-07-31 15:19:29	2008-07-31 15:16:04	1	0	1

Neil Abercrombie's description of an earmark and the description of what I believe is the same earmark in the House Appropriations Committee report:

<blockquote>Even with the name Abercrombie to connect the two entries, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still very vague. Saddle Road, which connects the harbor to the inland Pohakuloa Training Area, location of war games for Iraq-bound troops and Stryker tanks, is located on the Big Island, while Schofield Barracks is located on Oahu, another island.</blockquote>

I doubt that Saddle Road will be running underwater, but googling around, I found out some more. Abercrombie lists the beneficiary of his bill as being the Schofield Barracks on Oahu--I assume that means that the the barracks will be getting (and spending) the money. It looks like previous phases, however, were overseen by a <a href=""http://www.cflhd.gov/projects/StateProjectDetails.cfm?State=HI&WebProjectUID=10385"">different entity</a>:

<blockquote>The Central Federal Lands Highway Division of the Federal Highway Administration in cooperation with the Hawaii Department of Transportation is administering a construction project to improve Saddle Road in the County of Hawaii from milepost 19 to milepost 35. Improvements consist of grading, drainage, hot asphaltic concrete pavement, and superpave asphalt concrete pavement.

A construction contract was awarded to Goodfellow Brothers, Inc. on May 2, 2006 for the contract amount of $59,070,942.00.</blockquote>

So will the Schofield Barracks be choosing its own contractor for the next phase or will the Central Federal Lands Highway Division of the Federal Highway Administration continue to administer the project? And who will really be the recipient of these funds? Contractors like Goodfellow Brothers?

Neil Abercrombie, D-Hawaii, secured for the <a href=""http://www.saddleroad.com"">Saddle Road</a> project on Big Island. I sent a query along to Dave Gedeon, the <a href=""http://www.cflhd.gov/projects/StateProjectDetails.cfm?State=HI&WebProjectUID=10385"">project manager for the Central Federal Lands Highway Division of the Federal Highway Administration</a>, asking how the project was funded--whether these were military, Dept. of Transportation, or state funds, and which agency was managing the project. He was kind enough to respond and clarify:

<blockquote>Initial construction of Saddle Road began with the section that passes through the Department of the Army's Pohakuloa Training Area; funding for this section was provided through military construction appropriations; specifically, the Defense Access Road Program.  Only roads that are determined by the DOA to be important to national defense are eligible for DAR funds.  The first DAR funded construction project began in 2004; a final DAR-funded project will be awarded this fiscal year and be completed in 2009.  The initial emphasis was to reconstruct the DAR-funded section as first priority as the existing Saddle Road passes through the Army base and therefore impacts public and troop safety as well as military training at PTA.

The Hawaii Department of Transportation has provided funds from several of its own programs for the segments of Saddle Road that are outside of the army base; the majority of the State funds provided to date have been Surface Transportation Program funds.  Construction of the first HDOT-funded project started in 2006 and will be completed this summer.  Another State-funded project is scheduled to start construction in 2009.

The Central Federal Lands Highway Division is the lead agency for project development and construction contract administration and management.  The project is a cooperative undertaking among our agency, the HI Department of Transportation, and the Department of the Army.</blockquote>

Kaiser's excellent <em>Washington Post</em> series, <a href=""http://blog.washingtonpost.com/citizen-k-street/"">Citizen K Street</a>:

<blockquote>Cassidy helped change Washington by shaping the culture of congressional earmarks that became so important in the last dozen years. Earmarks directly transfer the government's money to particular institutions and interests. He and his original partner helped invent the idea of lobbying for earmarked appropriations -- an idea that made Cassidy rich and fed a system of interdependence between lobbyists and Congress that thrives today.</blockquote>

And, later in the piece...

<blockquote>Cassidy and his original partner, Kenneth Schlossberg, demonstrated its efficacy by devising ways to win earmarked appropriations from Congress for their clients, originally colleges, universities and medical centers. As Cassidy's clients began to win appropriations of $10 million, $15 million, $20 million and more in the 1980s, new lobbying firms emerged to compete with Cassidy. An increasing number of institutions and local governments looked for help to win earmarks of their own. The lobbying boom had begun.

It created a new career option for the men and women who had come to Washington to work in the government and could now cash in on their experience. Until the 1980s, the typical career of an aide on Capitol Hill lasted many years, even decades; today the average is probably a few years. ""Going downtown"" -- becoming a lobbyist -- has become a ritual, and not just for staff assistants. Numerous members of the House and Senate who retire or lose reelection bids have become lobbyists as well. More than 200 former members of Congress are registered to lobby their former colleagues. This is a new phenomenon in American history.</blockquote>

I think all this is true, and I would guess that the American people as a whole were the last to be let in on the new rules of the game. I can remember, after <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smith_Walker"">Rep. Robert S. Walker</a> retired from Congress in 1997, that my parents and other constituents of his in my hometown of Lancaster, Pa., were surprised that, rather than return to the district, <a href=""http://www.wexlergroup.com/walker.htm"">he chose to stay in Washington</a> (where he's described as a ""super lobbyist""). I wonder if, in other districts besides Pennsylvania's 16th, folks wonder why that Congressman who used to begin campaign rallies by talking about how much he loved coming home chose to ""retire"" to Washington, D.C. ...

But back to earmarks. The Office of Management and Budget <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/earmarks/preview-public-site/agencies742a.html?source=APP"">counted</a> 13,496 earmarks costing more than $19 billion in fiscal year 2005. That's the extent of money directed to specific projects and recipients--whether federal, state or local governments, for profit or nonprofit organizations, public or private universities, <em>by Congress</em>, in appropriations bills, authorization bills, or bill reports. That same year, according to <a href=""http://www.fedspending.org/fpds/tables.php?tabtype=t1&rowtype=c&subtype=a&sorttype=2005"">FedSpending.org</a>, the government committed some $384.2 billion to contractors alone, plus another $508 billion in grants and other assistance to state and local governments, nonprofits, universities, for profits, and other entities. That's a lot of money, even in Washington--and lobbyists aren't just asking members of Congress for it.  

Some 632 clients hired lobbyists who reported contacts with the Department of Homeland Security in 2006, <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/agencysum.asp?txtname=Dept+of+Homeland+Security"">according to the Center for Responsive Politics</a>. The lobbyists for <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/agencysum.asp?txtname=Dept+of+Defense"">1,026 clients</a> reported contacting the Defense Department. About what precisely they were interested in, or asking for, we have very little idea, but I would be willing to bet that federal contracting was on the minds of a few of them. 

Form SF-LLL, if we can get our hands on some, should give us some idea of how many.."		2007-04-09 01:52:57	2007-04-09 01:55:16	2007-04-09 01:52:57	1	0	1

Barack Obama, D-Ill., steered earmarks to some organizations with a board member who is also serving as a top bundler to his presidential campaign, according to the <a href=""http://thenextright.com/davidb11171/change-you-can-earmark"">Next Right</a>. This raises what for me is one of the primary questions about earmarks in general. Members of Congress say they know the needs of their states (or districts, in the case of House members). Whence comes this in-depth knowledge? Do they hear about needs from constituents, from their own personal observations, or do insiders--lobbyists, campaign contributors and others--educate them? Because the process is so opaque, in most cases we simply don't know."		2008-08-12 16:50:09	2008-08-12 16:50:09	2008-08-12 16:50:09	1	0	1
217	Mark Warner biggest recipient of lobbyist dough, new disclosures show (so far)	mark-warner-biggest-recipient-of-lobbyist-dough-new-disclosures-show-so-far	2	"Mark Warner, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s running for VirginiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s open seat to the U.S. Senate and will serve as the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, has received more than $206,000 from lobbyists since the beginning of the year, a Real Time Investigations analysis of recently released disclosure records show.

That makes Warner the top recipient of money contributed directly by lobbyists to congressional campaigns in 2008. Overall, Warner, the former Virginia governor who is seeking the seat now held by retiring Republican Sen. John Warner, has raised $18 million since he announced his candidacy in September 2007, according to Federal Election Commission records.

Real Time is releasing a list of the <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/top20_post.xls"">20 congressional campaigns</a> that have gotten the most contributions from individual lobbyists and a <a href=""http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/realtime/Lobbyists_Members_post.xls"">spreadsheet</a> with all individual contributions from lobbyists to federal candidates in the first six months of 2008. Close on the heels of Warner's $206,000 are Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and John Sununu, R-N.H.

Of the 20 members who have received the most in individual contributions from lobbyists only four are house members including Tom Udall, D-N.M., Mark Udall, D-Colo., John Murtha, D-Pa., and Eric Cantor, R-Va.

While the list is dominated by incumbents, some of Washington's K Street denizens are contributing heavily to the campaigns of challengers; in addition to Warner, Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s running against Sununu, has received more than $61,000 from lobbyistsÃ¢â‚¬â€16th on the list.

In all, the new disclosures, required by the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (HLOGA), reveal that federally registered lobbyists have given federal candidates more than $10 million since the beginning of this year. That figure does not include the money contributed to candidates by political action committees (PACs) associated with or directed by lobbyists. It is based on available records released by the Senate Office of Public Records (SOPR) as of Aug. 8.

The LD-203s, as the new contribution disclosure forms are called, must be filed twice a year by individual lobbyists, lobbying firms and the PACs that are related to them. Lobbyists have to disclose contributions to members of Congress, expenditures related to events where there are lawmakers were present and expenses related to events where lawmakers are honored. Additionally, all contributions to presidential libraries, including non-cash gifts, must be disclosed. Real Time will release analysis of those categories of giving in the coming weeks.

Lobbyists working for the Washington-based law firm Hogan &amp; Hartson LLP have donated more than $10,000 to WarnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s campaign, more than from any other firm. Their clients include health care and hospitals, government contractors such as EADS and automobile companies including Ford Motor Co. and General Motors.

Overall, lobbyists working for PMA Group, Patton Boggs and Williams &amp; Jensen, PLLC were the most generous supporters of federal candidates. PMA GroupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lobbyists led with more than $232,000 in campaign donations.

<strong>Methodology and issues with the data</strong>

The spread sheet weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re releasing today is based on data downloaded from the <a href=""http://www.senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/contributions_download.htm"">SOPR LD-203 page</a>, which was last updated Aug. 8. The spread sheet contains a subset of that data, focusing on contributions made under the Federal Election Campaign Act and directed to a particular candidateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s campaign. As noted, this data includes only contributions made by lobbyists to candidates and do not include contributions made to candidates through PACs associated with lobbying firms or with corporations. The numbers also look only at the money spent in campaign donations that are to be reported to the FEC. It doesn't include honorary expenditures or meeting expenses that have to be disclosed under the new rules.

This is the first time lobbyists have had to file LD-203 reports; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also the first time that SOPR (and the House ClerkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Office, which has also released the reports) has had to make the information public. The SOPR data system seems to have various teething issues. For one, it is impossible to correctly aggregate numbers, because SOPRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s data includes individual contributions multiple times. According to officials working with the Senate disclosure database, this is because no provision was made to identify which forms have been amended or changed after an initial filing. Thus, every time a lobbyist or firm files an amended disclosure, each contribution repeated is reentered into the system. Because some firms and individuals filed multiple disclosures, the raw Senate data ridiculously overstates the amount of contributions. Real Time relied on the most recently filed form from individuals to compile this database, eliminating double and triple counting (and reducing the record set from more than 107,000 to about 14,000 records).

There are other sources for potential double counting as well. Under HLOGA, a lobbyist who runs a PAC must disclose the PACÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contributions to members of Congress on his own LD-203. Because HLOGA requires PACs that are run by lobbyists to file LD-203s, those same contributions are disclosed a second time.

Besides double counting, there are other problems with the data. As per the rules, lobbyists have to disclose if they are on the board of a PAC; since there is no specific area to disclose this, the information is mostly added in the comments section, making it more difficult to determine that a contribution is from an individual lobbyist or the PAC heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s affiliated with.

Names of members of Congress and candidates arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t standardized in the data. In many cases, leadership PACs are listed as the recipient with no indication of which member is benefiting.

The data also contains obvious errors, including contributions to candidates running as high as $200,000 (individuals can contribute $2,300 to a campaign, PACs $5,000). In preparing this spread sheet, we left out more than 500 records which disclosed individual contributions of more than $2,300, assuming that people filling out the forms made an error.

Both the Senate and the House make the data available for download. As difficult to work with as the SOPR data was, the House side seems to be even more clunky. Rather than a single file, the House allows users to download each report individually, and assemble the database themselves.

According to the officials who manage the database at the Senate, what's available on the site is perhaps only 80 per cent of all the reports, which continue to trickle in, so users will get a full scope of the data only in the next couple of weeks."		2008-08-14 15:22:03	2008-08-14 15:22:03	2008-08-14 15:22:03	1	0	1

According to a  <span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'""><a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTON68094420070406?feedType=RSS"" title=""http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTON68094420070406?feedType=RSS"">Reuters report</a></span>, Senator McCain has questioned an Air Force decision giving Boeing contracts worth about $15 billion under the program.

On calling the SenatorÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s office I was told by the press spokeswoman, Melissa Sheffield that they Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºdonÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´t release these letters to the press.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ She added that I could get it from the Air Force. She did not explain why McCain's office, which acknowledges sending the letter, won't make its contents public.

Half a dozen calls to the Air Force got me nowhere; I was either put on hold or passed on from one Pentagon employee to the other. Finally, an employee with their legislative liaison office said that she could not locate the letter and they may not have received it yet if it was dated April 4.

We would love to see what McCainÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s asking in the letter to the Air Force."		2007-04-09 21:35:42	2007-04-10 17:58:13	2007-04-09 21:35:42	1	0	1

23	"""Our Pledge to You, the Constituent..."""	our-pledge-to-you-the-constituent	2	"Here's an idea that occurred to me after reading John Stanton's <a href=""http://www.rollcall.com/issues/52_105/news/17892-1.html?type=pf"">piece today</a> in Roll Call that notes the disclosure requirements for members of Congress who might personally profit from earmarks--part of the reforms adopted by the House and the Senate--don't apply to congressional aides. There's a passage in the article about a few members who have instituted internal ethics rules to deal with relatives of aides who lobby. Are these written rules? Are there other written rules that members have for their offices? And if so, will members make these public?

This is the relevant passage:
<blockquote>With no uniform rules governing the connection between lobbyists and aides, some lawmakers have instituted their own rules. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), for instance, have strict rules prohibiting relatives of aides from lobbying their offices.

Likewise, a spokesman for Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ® whose wife, Catherine, is a lobbyist Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ® said Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºSen. Stevens has a long-standing policy that staff membersÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ spouses or his spouse is not to lobby them on any issue.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹

A Reid spokesman also said the Majority Leader has banned lobbying of his office by the spouses of aides.

Following the investigation of his office, Specter put in place new rules governing his staff, including a ban on family members of aides lobbying Specter or his staff, barring aides from dealing with firms that employ their family members and full disclosure of any such relationships throughout the earmark consideration process.</blockquote>
I'm going to start by calling these members' offices, and see what I can find out...

<strong>Update</strong>: I left a message at Durbin's office and emailed McConnell's, and am now running late for a meeting. More later...

<strong>2d Update</strong>: I was out of the office all afternoon, so I have no idea if Durbin's office called back (after a full year and a month at Sunlight, I still haven't figured out how to remotely access my voicemail). Robert Steurer from McConnell's office emailed to tell me they don't normally release their office handbook, but he'd see what he could do. Here's hoping he comes through."		2007-04-10 17:38:57	2007-04-11 03:12:56	2007-04-10 17:38:57	1	0	1

Joe Biden of Delaware, James Biden, the Senator's brother, and plaintiff Anthony Lotito, who is the former business partner of the two non-elected Bidens in a deal that didn't work out. Both sides charge one another with cheating; hence the lawsuit. It turns out the New York State Supreme Court (where the case is filed) puts most of its documents online (<a  href=""http://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/webcivil/FCASMain"">here's</a> the home page for searching). 

The documents themselves indicate that the case has little to do with Sen. Biden -- whatever the truth of the allegations and counter-allegations, it appears that at most he asked his brother to call Lotito to see if he could help find something for his son to do other than being a <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lobbyist.php?year=2008&lname=Biden%2C+Robert+Hunter"">registered lobbyist</a> -- in the original <a href=""https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=sxEiZam5udb/HIp0qCJVAQ==&system=prod"">complaint</a>, it says that Biden's brother James was the source of this information. 

Perhaps the most interesting thing I came across in the documents is the Bidens' claim that they never would have entered the deal -- which involved buying some hedge funds in a partnership with Lotito that was called LBB Holdings USA Inc. -- if they were aware of Lotito's background and the background of the corporate counsel Lotito hired for the venture -- one John Fasciana. At the time that Lotito and the two Bidens hired Fasciana, he was awaiting <a href="" http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/November06/amatofascianasentencingpr.pdf"">sentencing</a> on a <a href=""http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/July05/fascianaconvictionpr.pdf"">2005 fraud conviction</a>. All I had to do to find those two DOJ press releases was to google John Fasciana -- didn't the Bidens do any due diligence in this $21 million deal? <a href=""https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=sxEiZam5udYmNFk0waBfyA==&system=prod"">Apparently not</a>:

<blockquote>Had we known of Fasciana's conviction and prior criminal conduct, we would not have retained Fasciana for any purpose. We also would not have formed LBB, and would not have engaged in any further business dealings with Lotito.</blockquote>

Are all Washington lobbyists with law degrees so trusting? Are they all such simple, naive folk that they don't check out the people they're doing business with? 

In any case, here are a few of the court documents, in case anyone wants to take a look:

<blockquote><a href=""https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=sxEiZam5udb/HIp0qCJVAQ==&system=prod"">Original summons & complaint</a> filed on behalf of Anthony Lotito;

262	TCS, Post examine Palin's pursuit of earmarks	tcs-post-examine-palins-pursuit-of-earmarks	2	"The most interesting story on Alaska Gov. and Republican nominee for Vice President Sarah Palin is the <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/01/AR2008090103148.html?hpid=topnews"">Washington Post's report</a> that, as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, Palin ""employed a lobbying firm to secure almost $27 million in federal earmarks for a town of 6,700 residents."" Our friends at <a href=""www.taxpayer.net"">Taxpayers for Common Sense</a> provided the earmark analysis. Note who Palin hired:

<blockquote>As mayor of Wasilla, however, Palin oversaw the hiring of Robertson, Monagle & Eastaugh, an Anchorage-based law firm with close ties to Alaska's most senior Republicans: Rep. Don Young and Sen. Ted Stevens, who was indicted in July on charges of accepting illegal gifts. The Wasilla account was handled by the former chief of staff to Stevens, Steven W. Silver, who is a partner in the firm. </blockquote>

It'll be interesting to see if this comes up at the debate between Palin and her Democratic counterpart, Sen. Joe Biden, whose son <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2008/08/27/washington-post-bidens-son-lobbied-obama/"">lobbied Sen. Barack Obama's staff</a> for an earmark. 

Also worth noting that there's a lot of lobbying by state and local governments, which use some of their taxpayer money to pry much more federal taxpayer money for their own states. 

<b>Update</b>: Don't know how I missed it before, but <a href=""http://www.taxpayer.net/resources.php?category=&type=Project&proj_id=1284&action=Headlines%20By%20TCS"">here's the list</a> of Wasilla earmarks, courtesy of our friends at <a href=""http://www.taxpayer.net"">Taxpyers for Common Sense</a>. The Girdwood to Wasilla, Alaska, commuter rail project in fiscal year 2001, for $15 million, might be worth a closer look. My understanding is that commuter rail requires a pretty high population density in order to be practical.

Along those lines, <a href=""http://www.fta.dot.gov/printer_friendly/planning_environment_3163.html"">hmmm....</a> 

<blockquote>In FY 2001, the Girdwood Commuter Rail Project (including North Anchorage) received a New Start earmark $14.9 million. B<ul>
ecause the proposed New Starts share is less than $25 million, the project is exempt from the New Starts criteria, and is thus not subject to FTAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evaluation and rating</ul>

 (TEA-21 Section 5309(e)(8)(A)). </blockquote>

From Appendix A of the <a href=""http://www.fta.dot.gov/printer_friendly/publications_2633.html"">Proposed Allocation of Funds for Fiscal Year 2002</a> from the Federal Transit Administration. The emphasis is in the original document. Note also this:

<blockquote>The ARRC [Alaska Railroad Corporation] operates both freight and passenger service over the sections of trackage to be improved. The passenger service is primarily geared toward serving tourists between the months of May and September.</blockquote>

Population density might not be all that meaningful in determining the route's practicality.

272	Tracking earmarks from Obama and Biden	earmarks-obama-biden	2	"Taxpayers for Commons Sense rolled out a pair of new databases on earmarks of presidential candidates, this time covering Sen. Barack Obama's requests from 2006 to 2008, and his funded earmarks for 2008. The databases are online <a href=""http://www.taxpayer.net/resources.php?category=&type=Project&proj_id=1321&action=Headlines%20By%20TCS"">here</a>. 

A list of the earmarks Sen. Joe Biden requested for fiscal year 2009 is available <a href=""http://biden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FY2009FundingRequests6.pdf"">here</a>. Robert Bluey at Red State is <a href=""http://www.redstate.com/diaries/bluey/2008/sep/12/why-wont-joe-biden-disclose-his-earmarks/"">calling on Biden</a> to disclose all his earmark requests--can't argue with that. But for those who want to dig around in the press release archives of his site, there are plenty of releases like <a href=""http://biden.senate.gov/press/press_releases/release/?id=b0e56b2e-cfc9-4a00-9a12-1024f9090a32"">this one</a> from prior years showing some of the earmarks he got funded. 

One that interests me in the above-linked release is this one:

<blockquote>$6.6 million for University of Delaware-Center for Composite Materials work for the Army, including $1.6 million for work for the Army on an advanced, lighter composite armored ambulance, $3 million for a composite armored truck cab able to add various armor packages, and $2 million for work on lighter composite add-on vehicle armor.</blockquote>

Take a look at the <a href=""http://www.ccm.udel.edu/"">Web page</a> of the University of Delaware-Center for Composite Materials, particularly the center's <a href=""http://www.ccm.udel.edu/Consortium/members.html"">consortium members</a>, which include huge defense contractors like Boeing, BAE Systems and General Dynamics, as well as three icons for ""Anonymous Member."" 

Somehow, I don't think composite armored truck cabs or lighter composite armored ambulances are research subjects of disinterested academic research the results of which will be available to all, but rather projects that will benefit certain companies exclusively. So who else benefits from the earmark?

Their Lehman Brothers list is <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/09/brothers-grim-is-lehman-next.html"">here</a> while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are <a href=""<a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/09/update-fannie-mae-and-freddie.html"">"">here</a>.

To see who in Congress invested in these operations, CRP has compiled an analysis of Freddie and Fannie holdings <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/09/congressmen-may-have-lost-17-m.html"">here</a>; you can also dig into search results for Lehman Brothers <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/search_results.php?org=lehman+brothers"">here</a> (Rep.

It will be very interesting to look at who's been selling Fannie, Freddie and Lehmans and when. Members of Congress must disclose transactions, and it will be interesting to see if members were dumping their stock ahead of the various announcements of takeovers and bankruptcies. Sadly, we won't see that data until June 2009.

I was looking at it Friday, browsing the stories, and some of it is pretty incredible (the list of 285 failures is pretty incredible). Reading about <a href=""http://ml-implode.com/imploded/lender_MeritFinancial_2006-05-06.html"">the first failure</a>, Merit Financial, gives a <a href=""http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003459108_merit03.html"">flavor</a> of just how freewheeling these firms could be:

<blockquote>The 42 complaints received by state agencies and the Better Business Bureau give insight into Merit's problems. Addressed individually, none was serious enough to shut the company down.

In one, the state ordered Merit to refund a borrower's fees Ã¢â‚¬â€ $11,422 Ã¢â‚¬â€ after finding that the company had violated nine federal and state laws and processed the loan without getting the borrower's signatures on required forms.

Merit also drew complaints that it charged excessive fees, failed to provide federally required loan documents, failed to disclose fees and terms, harassed customers and repeatedly forged documents.

One complaint came from Lynnzel Hernandez Valdez-Nabua. A first-time homebuyer from Everett, she complained that Merit forged her sister's signature, originally provided as a reference, to say it was her employer's.

The company that bought Valdez-Nabua's loan from Merit apparently discovered the forgery when it contacted her employer for verification. She was fired because she could not conclusively prove she didn't commit the deed.

Valdez-Nabua said she called Merit repeatedly to complain and got no response.

Shown a stack of customer complaints, Greenlaw said he didn't know about them. However, he stressed that shady or illegal practices were not condoned.

Loan officer Hoppe said she had a different experience. Ordered to complete a loan for an elderly homeowner who was incapable of understanding it, she said she refused.

""Merit's whole attitude was, 'Get the deal,' "" Hoppe said.</blockquote>

That's just one of 285, of course. A handy resource for keeping track of what's going on."		2008-09-22 16:14:14	2008-09-22 16:14:14	2008-09-22 16:14:14	1	0	1
289	Financial Bailout: Who's minding the store?	financial-bailout-whos-minding-the-store	2	"As Congress begins wrestling with the Bush administration's financial industry <a href=""http://publicmarkup.org/bill/legislative-proposal-treasury-department-authority/"">bailout legislation</a> (and Sen. Christopher Dodd's <a href=""http://publicmarkup.org/bill/dodds-legislative-proposal-treasury-department-aut/"">alternative</a>), perhaps it's worth asking who are these folks who may well be deciding the economic fate of the nation? In this post (which took me about five hours longer to put together than I'd anticipated; hint to <a href=""http://www.sunlightlabs.org"">Labs</a>: we need to design a tool to do this stuff faster), we take a look at the Senate Banking Committee and the House Finance Committee. Specifically, we look at how much of the campaign cash raised by members of those committees has come from the industries at the epicenter of the crisis -- finance, insurance and real estate -- over the course of their careers. 

In other words, how disinterested are particular members of Congress when they approach this issue? When Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., a member of the House Finance Committee and the chair of its subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government Sponsored Enterprises, casts his vote for or against particular provisions of the bailout, or the entire bill, will he have in the back of his mind the 41.6 percent of his career contributors who work for companies that will be affected by his vote? What about Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., ranking member of the House Finance Committee, who over the course of his career has relied on affected industries for 42.2 percent of his campaign cash? Sen. Christopher Dodd, chair of the Senate Banking Committee, and Rep. Barney Frank, his counterpart in the House, have both received more than 30 percent of their campaign donations from finance, insurance and real estate PACs, employees and their family members. Over the course of their careers, they've raised a lot of money from people whose interest now is an a bailout on the most generous terms available for their industry. How will they balance all the competing interests? 

What follows is my very rudimentary list, starting with President George W. Bush's 2004 fundraising, then the Senate Banking Committee, followed by the House Finance Committee. Committee chairs and ranking members are listed first, followed by subcommittee members, followed by the remainder of the committee members, Democrats first, then Republicans.

32	USDA Puts Aid RecipientsÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ Social Security Numbers Online	usda-puts-aid-recipients%e2%80%99-social-security-numbers-online	3	"<span style=""color: black"">For almost a decade, some divisions of the Department of Agriculture published the Social Security numbers of individuals who receive federal aid in a publicly available online database of government grants. The Farm Service Agency and at least one other agency within Agriculture included the nine digit numbers as part of the tracking number assigned to each recipient of government assistance, called a Federal Award ID. <o:p></o:p></span>

<span style=""color: black"">Those tracking numbers were then published in the Federal Assistance Awards Database System (</span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: ""Times New Roman""; color: black""><a href=""http://www.census.gov/govs/www/faads.html"">FAADS</a></span><span style=""color: black"">), an online compendium of Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂº</span>all types of financial assistance awards made by federal agencies to all types of recipients,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ which is updated quarterly. This database is generally used by experts and is not very user-friendly.

<span style=""color: black"">So far, itÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s not clear whether the inadvertent publication of individualsÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ Social Security numbers is limited to the two agencies in Agriculture, or whether the problem extends to other departments and agencies as well. <o:p></o:p></span>

The government has removed Federal Award IDs from the FAADS database; however, researchers, journalists, news organizations, nonprofits and numerous others with an interest in government programs have been downloading the data for years. The government was alerted to the problem after a citizen discovered the personal information on a Web site maintained by a nonprofit group.

<span style=""color: black"">Marsha Bergmeier, whose family farm receives loans through a Farm Service Agency program, discovered the problem through a Google search. She came across records for her farm on </span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: ""Times New Roman""; color: black""><a href=""http://fedspending.org/"">FedSpending.org</a></span><span style=""color: black"">, a user-friendly database of government spending produced by the nonprofit watchdog group OMB Watch that includes data from FAADS. (Full disclosure: OMB Watch is a grantee of the Sunlight Foundation, which provided funding for FedSpending.org.)<o:p></o:p></span>

<span style=""color: black"">On the OMB Watch site, Bergmeier found that personal information, including her farmÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s tax ID number, was a part of a string of digits under the Federal Award ID column. <o:p></o:p></span>

<span style=""color: black"">Bergmeier alerted OMB Watch and the Department of Agriculture, setting off a series of discussions and email exchanges among the staff of OMB Watch and officials from Agriculture and the Census Bureau, which maintains the FAADS database.<o:p></o:p></span>

<span style=""color: black"">The <em>New York Times </em>is expected to publish a detailed story on this later today.<o:p></o:p></span>

<strong><span style=""color: black"">Thousands of individuals affected<o:p></o:p></span></strong>

<span style=""color: black"">Gary Bass, executive director of OMB Watch, characterized the oversight as Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºdeplorable.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ He said that government officials first asked OMB Watch to pull down one recordÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®BergmeierÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´sÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®and later requested to remove the entire Federal Award ID field, as they suspected there could be more such cases. <o:p></o:p></span>

<span style=""color: black"">Once again, it was Bergmeier who discovered the problem. <o:p></o:p></span>

<span style=""color: black"">As she dug deeper into FAADS data using online searches, she found that there were more than 28,000 cases where peopleÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s Social Security numbers were being used as the primary ID for the records. In an email she sent to OMB Watch on April 13, she wrote, Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºI have identified 28,209 records on your Web site that contain Social Security numbers and banking information.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ <o:p></o:p></span>

<span style=""color: black"">Both OMB Watch and Commerce have removed the Federal Award ID field from their Web sites. <o:p></o:p></span>

<span style=""color: black"">But removing the numbers doesnÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´t solve all the problems that publishing the Social Security numbers caused while creating other problems. As Bass noted, the Federal Award ID, which is the unique record identification, is essential for any type of investigator making a Freedom of Information Act requestÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®which is much harder for the government to fill without a specific transaction number. While a Census data specialist Mike Mashburn maintained that researchers can still use the information without the Federal Award ID numbers, the data cannot be mined to its fullest without this information. <o:p></o:p></span>

<span style=""color: black"">Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºThe best possible solution is for the USDA to quickly re-generate the ID numbers and resolve the problem, and this should technically take an hour,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ Bass said. As of Thursday morning, government officials had yet to determine how they were going to address the problem.<o:p></o:p></span>

<span style=""color: black"">Even with the Federal Award ID removed, there is no way to tell how many people may already have access to the dataÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®including thousands of Social Security numbers. Take OMB WatchÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®they said they have had as many as three million searches of FedSpending.org data since the site was launched in October 2006. <o:p></o:p></span>

<span style=""color: black"">Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºThere is no way to say how many people have downloaded it or have copies of it,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ Bass said. In fact, after the Census Bureau redacted the Federal Award IDs on its server earlier this week, OMB Watch did a search on Tuesday and found that the National Archives had FAADS recordsÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®still showing the IDsÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®on their Web site. <o:p></o:p></span>

<span style=""color: black"">Besides government agencies, other private organizations such as Investigative Reporters and Editors also have this data. Since 2002, </span><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: ""Times New Roman""; color: black""><a href=""http://www.ire.org/"">IRE</a></span><span style=""color: black""> has distributed this data to at least three dozen media organizations. <o:p></o:p></span>

<span style=""color: black"">We have not received comment on this story from any government official in spite of numerous and repeated phone calls.<o:p></o:p></span>"		2007-04-20 16:09:34	2007-04-20 16:32:44	2007-04-20 16:09:34	1	0	1

<blockquote>The FBI is investigating Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers and AIG - and their executives - as part of a broad look into possible mortgage fraud, sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN Tuesday.

The sources would not speak on the record because the investigation is ongoing.

FBI spokesman Special Agent Richard Kolko had no comment on that information, but said that 26 firms were currently under investigation as part of the bureau's mortgage fraud inquiry.</blockquote>

I laughed at <a href=""http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/09/the_fbi_investigating_major_fi.php"">Megan McCardle's reaction</a> ....

<blockquote>Is stupidity a federal offense?  And if so, when do they investigate congress?</blockquote>

...but then I remembered <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/finance/2008/09/23/citi-merrill-goldman-pf-ii-in_ja_0923soapbox_inl.html"">this piece</a>, which I came across last night while putting together the Dodd & Shelby posts immediately below: 

<blockquote>Lest you think Citigroup is a lone rogue firm, in 2003, 10 Wall Street investment banks settled with the SEC on various charges. They included Goldman Sachs (nyse: GS - news - people ), Morgan Stanley (nyse: MS - news - people ), Lehman Brothers (nyse: LEH - news - people ), Piper Jaffrey (nyse: PJC - news - people ), UBS Warburg, Merrill Lynch (nyse: MER - news - people ) and Credit Suisse First Boston. We don't have the time or space to get into histories on all these companies. 

***

It should be clear that this pattern of scandals and financial calamities are not caused by really stupid people somehow getting to the highest positions of power in corporate America and then making huge mistakes out of carelessness. This is the structure of the system. </blockquote>

And here's the kicker...

<blockquote>The fact is that our regulators are subject to political pressure. And politicians get donations from fat cats, who use corporate, private and association donations to influence politicians to go easy on legislation and regulation. 

There are few good guys in either party. The Glass-Steagall Act was repealed during the Clinton administration, and that repeal has taken less than a decade to bring the banking system to its knees. The Bush administration has effectively gutted the fraud provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley by having those in charge of enforcing the laws biased in favor of fat cat contributors. A recent article in The Wall Street Journal reported that records show the government has ruled in favor of corporate whistle-blowers a mere 17 times out of 1,273 complaints filed since 2002. An additional 841 cases have been dismissed outright. Is it possible that so few complaints filed under this law had no merit? You tell me.</blockquote>"		2008-09-24 14:11:07	2008-09-24 14:11:07	2008-09-24 14:11:07	1	0	1

In the past this earmark has been awarded to Phoenix Products, Inc., a small company in McKee,  Ky.
<p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2007/12/18/earmarks-boost-small-kentucky-businesses/"">As Real Time reported last year</a>, although this company has received more than $10.4 million in earmarks from Rogers, Army officials said at the time, that they have yet to decide if the transmission drip pans should be purchased from the company at all. As in previous years, employees and owners of the company have contributed to RogerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leadership political action committee in 2008 and have retained the same lobbying firm, Martin, Fisher, Thompson &amp; Associates, to lobby on defense appropriations.</p>"		2008-09-24 20:37:00	2008-09-24 20:37:00	2008-09-24 20:37:00	1	0	1

353	Financial Bailout: Who do McCain and Obama see at their fundraisers?	financial-bailout-who-do-mccain-and-obama-see-at-their-fundraisers	2	"Sen. John McCain and Sen. Barack Obama are <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080925/ap_on_el_pr/candidates_economic_crisis"">returning to Washington today</a> to lend their legislative talents to the bailout bill working its way through Congress. So let's take a look at the biggest contributors to their presidential campaigns, courtesy of our friends at the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org"">Center for Responsive Politics</a>.

Going in alphabetical order, we'll take McCain first.

357	Financial Bailout: Lobbyists' Donations to Senate Banking Members	financial-bailout-lobbyists-donations-to-senate-banking-members	3	"<p class=""MsoNormal"">In-house lobbyists and other major Washington lobbying firms hired by eight investment and securities companies have given Senate Banking Committee members more than $380,000 in campaign donations in the first six months of 2008, according to the LD-203 lobbying disclosures filed with the Senate Office of Public Records.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Lobbyists and company political action committees working on behalf of eight companies that have been involved in Wall Street's financial turmoil have made donations to 15 of the 20 Senators on the committee. (The eight investment companies included here are American International Group, Bears Stearns, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. obviously, many other firms have interests in the financial bailout legislation now being considered by Congress. We chose this sampling because these firms rank among the top contributors to many of the key members.)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a quick look at how much each member on the committee has received:</p>

36	DOD misinterpreted the FOIA	dod-misinterpreted-the-foia	3	"
<p class=""MsoNormal"">A couple of days ago I followed up with DOD about why they denied our FOIA for correspondence logs earlier. Their denial was based on the fact that the records were too large and they wanted us to narrow our request. On talking to them I figured that DOD officials had interpreted our FOIA to include all documents and not just the logs of correspondences. So, they agreed to re-open our FOIA based on this clarification.<o:p>Ã‚Â¬Ã¢â‚¬Â </o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Unfortunately, other Agencies have also been misinterpreting out FOIAs, assuming we are asking for copies of the letters and not just the logs.<o:p>Ã‚Â¬Ã¢â‚¬Â </o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So Bill and I decided that a slight change in language asking for only the dates of replies may help, which we have made going forth.<o:p>Ã‚Â¬Ã¢â‚¬Â </o:p></p>

Note: This research is based on our analysis of forms LD-203, on file with the Senate Office of Public Records."		2008-09-26 15:28:11	2008-09-26 15:28:11	2008-09-26 15:28:11	1	0	1
375	Financial Bailout: Are congressional leaders invested in the crisis?	financial-bailout-are-congressional-leaders-invested-in-the-crisis	2	"Members of Congress continue to debate the bailout package that may well affect the bottom line of every taxpayer in the country, as well as those of big banks, brokerages, and other financial firms. While they hear from numerous experts, including distressed Wall Street titans, on the dangers facing their firms, what sort of exposure do members themselves have if those firms fail?

In their most recent financial disclosure forms, the chairmen and ranking members of the key House and Senate committees considering the $700 billion bailout of the financial sector disclosed investments in firms with interests in the outcome of the legislation. 

Sen. Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and a key member of the Democratic team negotiating a bailout, disclosed investments are in large mutual funds ranging from Growth Fund for America, Capital Income Builder Fund and a few others managed by the Capital Group worth somewhere between $130,000 and 300,000. (Financial disclosure forms require members to value their assets within broad ranges, hence the high and low figures used throughout this post). In the bailout talks underway, mutual funds may be given the same kind of protection as checking and savings accounts. In addition, Dodd and his wife, Jackie, invested $30,002 to $100,000 with the Fortress Investment Group, a <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/markets/2008/09/25/fortress-suspends-dividend-markets-equity-cx_md_0925markets27.html"">firm</a> that manages private equity funds and hedge funds. Dodd also has assets with Smith Barney IRA, whose parent company is CitiGroup, which stands to <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/innovationNews/idUSTRE48O99E20080925"">gain from a bailout</a> through the sale of as much as $79.4 billion of their troubled assets. Dodd's most recent financial disclosure form is available <a href=""http://pfds.opensecrets.org/N00000581_2007.pdf"">here</a>.

Ranking member Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., is the owner and still chairman of the board of Tuscaloosa Title Insurance, valued at between $1,000,001 and $5 million. Title insurance firms <a href=""http://www.milliman.com/perspective/articles/collateral-damage-the-subprime-5-1-08.php"">may be facing</a> a slowdown as the housing market cools and the credit crunch makes refinancing more difficult. Shelby disclosed real estate investments in Alabama, including an office building, worth between $501,002 and $1,015,000, while his wife, Lisa Shelby, owned a home in Alabama and a Townhouse in Washington, D.C., each of which are worth more then $1 million. Lisa Shelby also had money invested with Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Indymac Bank worth between $215,003 and $550,000. All three concerns have been pounded in the financial crisis. Citigroup has written off billions in subprime loans, Merrill Lynch was recently acquired by Bank of America, and Indymac was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in July. Shelby's most recent financial disclosure form is available <a href=""http://pfds.opensecrets.org/N00009920_2007.pdf"">here</a>. 

Rep. Barney Frank, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, has invested most heavily in a series of Massachusetts state and municipal bonds that funded everything from industrial development and the Massachusetts Turnpike to schools and water projects. However, one of the House Finance Committee chair's two largest investments, worth between $100,001 to $250,000, was in the Calvert Social Investment Fund. A <a href=""http://www.calvertgroup.com/news_newsArticle.html?article=13674&image=cn.gif&keepleftnav=Calvert+News"">news release</a> on Calvert's home page said the company ""fully supports the essential public mission of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of promoting broader access to home ownership,"" despite that mission having resulted in the near failure of both organizations, averted only by Treasury Department's seizure of the firms. Calvert also <a href=""http://www.calvertgroup.com/news_newsArticle.html?article=13675&image=cn.gif&keepleftnav=Calvert+News"">released</a> figures on its investments in firms including American International Group, Merrill Lynch and Bank of America. 

Frank also disclosed a $15,001 to $50,000 investment in a Citibank Deposit Program. His most recent financial disclosure form is available <a href=""http://pfds.opensecrets.org/N00000275_2007.pdf"">here</a>.

At the end of 2007, Linda Bacchus, the wife of Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., held between $212,009 and $696,000 in CitiGroup Capital Market mutual funds; Bachus himself traded shares in companies like Exxon Mobil, Apple, Sony and Research in Motion. Bachus' biggest asset was a property on Rocky Ridge Road in Birmingham, Ala., worth between $100,001 and $250,000. A Google search shows a <a href=""http://www.1clickgifts.net/gift/al_birmingham_gifts.shtml"">listing for a gift shop</a> at that address. Bachus has a mortgage on the property with Compass Bank; he owes somewhere between $100,001 and $250,000 on the property. Compass Bank has an <a href=""https://www.compassbank.com/appforms/properties/index.jspa"">online search service</a> to look through the bank's foreclosed properties. Bachus' most recent financial disclosure form can be found <a href=""http://pfds.opensecrets.org/N00008091_2007.pdf"">here</a>.

Members disclose information through the end of the previous calendar year; thus, current disclosures list assets members held as of December 2007. Investments and transactions from 2008, including those held, bought or sold by members during the crisis, will not be released to the public until June 2009.

38	Bureaucratic-ese	bureaucratic-ese	2	"There's almost a Lewis Carroll-like quality to the following passage in the Federal Register, (54 FR 52307-8, for those keeping score at home), in which the Office of Management and Budget published its interim rule for complying with the Byrd amendment, which barred government contractors and grantees from using federal funds to lobby (it became effective Dec. 23, 1989): 

<blockquote>Costs made specifically unallowable by the requirements in the guidance are not made allowable under any of the provisions of these Circulars. Conversely, costs that are specifically unallowable under the provisions of these Circulars are not made allowable under the requirements in the guidance. Costs made specifically unallowable by the requirements in the OMB guidance will not be made allowable under any of the provisions of the FAR. Conversely, costs that are specifically unallowable under the provisions of the FAR are not made allowable under the requirements in the OMB guidance. </blockquote>

39	"Coast Guard ""never requested"" Deepwater SF-LLLs"	coast-guard-never-requested-deepwater-sf-llls	2	"The Coast Guard responded to one of the first Freedom of Information Act requests I made (described <a href=""http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/node/2068"">here)</a> for an SF-LLL--the disclosures that contractors have to file when they lobby the government in connection with a contract. I asked for any SF-LLLs filed in connection with Deepwater, the multi-year contract to design a new generation of ships and systems for the Coast Guard. Integrated Coast Guard Systems, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Northop Grumman, won the contract. Both companies lobbied Congress and the Coast Guard over the program (see page 19 of <a href=""http://sopr.senate.gov/cgi-win/opr_gifviewer.exe?/2002/01/000/524/000524304|21"">this form</a> or page 7 of <a href=""http://sopr.senate.gov/cgi-win/opr_gifviewer.exe?/2002/01/000/516/000516924|9"">this form</a>), specifying Deepwater as a subject of interest.

Here's part of the Coast Guard's reply:
<blockquote>This is in response to your Freedom of Information (FOIA) request dated February 2, 2007, for documents filed by or behalf of Northrop Grumman Corp. or Lockheed Martin Corp. in connection with the contract award number HSCG23-02-C-2DW001 made to Integrated Coast Guard Systems, Duns number 0364758330000.

The requested is not available because this information was never requested from either company;  therefore, neither Northrop Grumman Corp. or Lockheed Martin Corp, was required to submit the requested form.</blockquote>
Curiouser and curiouser. Here is part of the instructions for filing an SF-LL:
<blockquote>This disclosure form shall be completed by the reporting entity, whether subawardee or prime Federal recipient, at the initiation or receipt of a covered Federal action, or a material change to a previous filing, pursuant to title 31 U.S.C. section 1352. The filing of a form is required for each payment or agreement to make payment to any lobbying entity for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with a covered Federal action.</blockquote>
I'm not sure why an agency would have to ""request"" a form SF-LLL before a company that's lobbying would be obligated under the law to file one. But it would be interesting to find out.

One other wrinkle: Under 31 U.S.C. section 1352, contractors also have to attest that they have not used any federal funds to lobby in connection with the contract award. So in addition to trying to nail down why the Coast Guard did not ask for SF-LLLs, I'm going to file another FOIA asking for any such attestations as required by the Byrd Amendment filed in connection with the contract."		2007-05-01 22:36:07	2007-05-02 16:29:27	2007-05-01 22:36:07	1	0	1

4	What we're up to	what-were-up-to	2	"<font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">We're launching a number of real time investigative projects at the <a href=""http://www.sunlightfoundation.com"">Sunlight  Foundation</a>, and this blog is sort of a diary of the investigations, where you  can follow, day by day, what my colleague, Investigative Writer Anupama  Narayanswamy, and I are up to as we go about our business trying to make  Congress more transparent.</font>

<font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">Right now, Anupama's main focus (you'll be hearing a lot more about this in the days to come) is  FOIAing all of the roughly 120 federal agencies, requesting correspondence logs from members of Congress for January and February 2007. As they come in, we'll start putting them online in a searchable database, with the name of the member, the date of the letter, its subject, and whether the agency responded. Our intention is to continue FOIAing these records month by month, regularly updating the database. If a member writes to the Justice Department about a U.S. Attorney, or the Defense Department on behalf of a company seeking a contract, a user will be able to find out by searching our database. A side benefit is that we'll also be able to measure the speed with which various agencies respond to FOIA. Hats off, by the way, to the <a href=""http://www.cftc.gov/"">Commodities Futures Trading Commission</a>, which responded the same day Anu sent out the request (although in a PDF rather than in a more database-friendly format).</font>

<font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">We're both going to work on what I'm starting to think of as the mystery of form <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants/sflllin.pdf"">SF-LLL</a>, a federally mandated disclosure that contractors and grantees have to file if they've lobbied the government to get contracts or grants. This may sound a bit arcane--and not just to you; some government officials I've asked about it have reacted by saying, more or less, ""an SF-what-what-what?"" But the form has to be filed ""for each payment or agreement to make payment to any lobbying entity for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with a covered federal action."" I should add that the covered federal actions are contracts and grants and few other types of federal funding (loans, etc.). So in theory, if you could get all SF-LLLs, you could distinguish between contractors that win federal dollars solely through the merits of their goods and services, and those that attempt to involve political influence in the process. That seems to me to be a not insignificant bit of information.</font>

<font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">We've got other things cooking, but that's enough for a first post on our rather unfurnished blog. (It reminds me of my first apartment--hardwood floors, nice windows, and little more than a futon in the corner and a pile of books on the floor...)</font>

403	Financial Bailout: Deal hammered out?	financial-bailout-deal-hammered-out	2	"That's what a series of members are saying on a press conference I happened to tune into a few moments ago -- there's an agreement, but details have to be worked out (including getting it all down on paper).

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., cited Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., as being critical to the negotiations, along with Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chair of the Senate Finance Committee. 

The House Republican negotiator, Rep. Roy Blunt, on now, cited Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio and Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va. 

Dodd, who followed blunt, cited Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Reid. 

Like Dodd, Conrad was a ""friend of Angelo,"" and <a href=""http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/archives2/020992.php"">got a sweetheart mortgage deal</a> from Countrywide Financial. Over his career, Conrad has gotten <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cid=N00004613&cycle=Career"">$2,370,437</a> from the finance, insurance and real estate sector, according to our friends at the Center for Responsive Politics. That's 18.6 percent of the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cycle=Career&cid=N00004613"">$12,722,554</a> he's raised over his career. Among his top donors are a few of firms at the center of the financial crisis: CitiGroup, Fannie Mae and Goldman Sachs.

Baucus ranks <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/09/money-and-votes-aligned-in-con.html"">11th among active lawmakers</a> in contributions from the finance, insurance and real estate sectors, having raised $4,491,183 from employees, their immediate family members, and PACs of organizations in that sector. That's 18.7 percent of the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cycle=Career&cid=N00004643"">$24,068,409</a> he's taken in overall. His top donor list reads like a roster of business section headlines of firms in the midst of the financial crisis: employees and PACs of American International Group, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., CitiGroup, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have been among his most generous donors. 

According to his <a href=""http://pfds.opensecrets.org/N00004643_2007.pdf"">most recent financial disclosure form</a>, Baucus had a diversified portfolio, with most of his individual holdings falling in a range between $1,001 and $15,000; among the firms he invested in were J.P. Morgan Chase and Lehman Brothers Holdings. 

Like Baucus, Schumer is a <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/09/money-and-votes-aligned-in-con.html"">top recipient</a> of money from the finance, insurance and real estate sector, ranking 6th, just behind Dodd, with $12,795,946 in contributions, or 27.6 percent of the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00001093&cycle=Career"">$46,362,049</a> he's raised over his career. Schumer's nine most career donors all figure in the current turmoil: Goldman Sachs, CitiGroup, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, UBS AG, Credit Suisse Group and Lehman Brothers. Schumer's also gotten substantial support from employees, their family members and PACs of American International Group.

Schumer's recent financial disclosure form showed that he owned stock in Fannie Mae (between $2,002 and $30,000 worth). 

...We'll take a look at the House Republicans tomorrow morning...

Thanks to <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org"">Open Secrets</a>, the Web site of the Center for Responsive Politics, all this information is easily accessible online. 

Over the course of his political career, minority leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, has raised <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/09/money-and-votes-aligned-in-con.html"">$2,933,009</a> from political action committees, employees and their immediate family members of organizations in the finance, insurance and real estate sector. That's 18.3 percent of the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00003675&cycle=Career"">$15,906,048</a>. Among his <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=Career&cid=N00003675"">top donors</a> are the National Association of Realtors (they favor <a href=""http://www.realtor.org/press_room/news_releases/2008/foreclosures_are_last_resort"">loosening regulations on short sales</a> as an alternative to foreclosure) and the American Bankers Association (<a href=""http://www.aba.com/Press+Room/092208GSEPreferredStock.htm"">which has called</a> for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to keep paying dividends, despite going bust). 

Boehner <a href=""http://pfds.opensecrets.org/N00003675_2007.pdf"">disclosed</a> holdings in numerous mutual funds, but his biggest asset, worth somewhere between $1 million and $5 million, is his profit sharing plan from Nucite Sales, a firm that serves as a sales force for manufacturers in the packaging and plastics industries.

Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., has raised <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/09/money-and-votes-aligned-in-con.html"">$2,870,103</a> from employees, their family members and PACs in the financial, insurance and real estate sector over the course of his career, or 24.6 percent of his total take of <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cycle=Career&cid=N00013131"">$11,666,917</a>.  Among his top donors are Wachovia Corp. (the <a href=""http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080926/D93EJMT80.html"">next institution</a> to fall?), Capital One (<a href=""http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/story/437612.html"">getting out</a> of the home mortgage business), Goldman Sachs and the National Association of Realtors."		2008-09-28 15:20:01	2008-09-28 15:20:01	2008-09-28 15:20:01	1	0	1

It will be interesting to see both the final language and the conference report. I wonder if the bill will end up including things like <a href=""http://www.ewg.org/node/21518"">taxpayer funding for peanut warehouses</a> to bring reluctant members on board.

424	Financial Bailout: Fannie Mae announces subpoena	financial-bailout-fannie-mae-announces-subpoena	2	"Fannie Mae announced &lt;a href=""http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310522/000129993308004533/0001299933-08-004533.txt""&gt;today&lt;/a&gt; that it's gotten more subpoenas from the SEC and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On September 26, 2008, Fannie Mae received notice of ongoing federal government investigations and inquiries into Fannie Mae by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") regarding certain accounting, disclosure and corporate governance matters.Ã‚Â  In connection with those investigations and inquiries, Fannie Mae received a Grand Jury subpoena for documents from the Southern District of New York and a request for preservation of documents related to the inquiry from the Staff of the SEC.Ã‚Â  Fannie Mae expects to receive requests for documents from the staff of the SEC.

The Company intends to cooperate fully with these investigations and inquiries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of course a lot has changed at Fannie Mae since it was taken over by Treasury, but nevertheless the last line reminded me of the last effort to investigate Fannie Mae -- undertaken by the &lt;a href=""http://www.ofheo.gov""&gt;Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight&lt;/a&gt;, an independent entity within the Department of Housing and Urban Development that, it says &lt;a href=""http://www.ofheo.gov/about.aspx""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, ""works to ensure the capital adequacy and financial safety and soundness of two  housing government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac."" OFHEO uncovered Fannie Mae's &lt;a href=""http://www.ofheo.gov/media/pdf/fnmserelease.pdf""&gt;bad accounting practices&lt;/a&gt; after a two year investigation in 2006.

One of the interesting bits in the release, elaborated on in the &lt;a href=""http://www.ofheo.gov/media/pdf/FNMSPECIALEXAM.PDF""&gt;full report&lt;/a&gt; (warning: it's a big file; start on page 273) concerns Fannie Mae's use of lobbyists to try to upend the investigation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fannie Mae senior management sought to interfere with OFHEOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s special examination by directing the EnterpriseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lobbyists to use their ties to Congressional staff to 1) generate a CongressionalÃ‚Â  request for the Inspector General of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to investigate OFHEOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conduct of that examination and 2) insert into an appropriations bill language that would reduceÃ‚Â  the agencyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s appropriations until the Director of OFHEO was replaced.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The full report goes into more detail, noting a close resemblance of the language of a letter sent by a member of Congress, Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo, to HUD's inspector general requesting an investigation: ""OFHEO found a draft of the Congressional request letter on Fannie MaeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s computer system that was nearly identical to the request letter that was ultimately sent to the HUD Inspector General. That draft is dated April 15, 2004, almost two weeks before the actual request letter was sent.""

Bond &lt;a href=""http://bond.senate.gov/atwork/recordtopic.cfm?id=228166""&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that by investigating Fannie Mae, OFHEO officials ""misused their agency and abused the public trust.""

The Hill reports,

<blockquote>When the two companies were taken over by the government, they said they would end lobbying practices that had made them a powerful force in Washington.

Still, the lost contracts could hit K Street hard.

Overall, 37 outside firms filed second-quarter reports for Fannie and Freddie, according to Senate records.</blockquote>

Needless to say, some lobbyists aren't thrilled.

<blockquote>Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are in uncharted territory here. There is not a clear blueprint on how to do this, but it has to be done with dispatch,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Gross, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.

435	Who's Paying for Election Ads? Follow the 527 Widget...	whos-paying-for-election-ads-follow-the-527-widget	3	"<p class=""MsoNormal"">The <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4lc6n7B7N8"">30-second ad</a> is typical fare for a campaign: the taxing and spending of a candidate, in this case former Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., is pilloried. Her Republican opponent, Sen. John Sununu, facing a tough race, did not pay for the ad out of his own campaign funds. Instead, FEC filings show, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ponied up the $750,000 to attack Shaheen.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Political nonprofits are playing a bigger role than ever in election 2008, and Real Time (with assistance from <a href=""http://www.sunlightlabs.org"">Sunlight Labs</a>) is making it easy to find the latest information on ads run by independent groups about federal candidates. We cull the information from the <a href=""http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ec_table.shtml"">FECÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Electioneering Communication database</a>, which lists all campaign ads that have aired 30 days prior to a primary or 60 days prior to a general election. These reports disclose information on officers of, donors to, and expenditures by these organizations, and must be filed within 24 hours after an ad airs. Real Time has converted this data to an easy to use widget that shows data as it is updated on the FEC site on a daily basis in the run up to the general election in November. Users can also download the data as an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">While Real Time's widget makes it easy to find the forms, the most interesting information is often buried within the (often handwritten) pages.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In the past month, for example, a little known D.C. nonprofit has spent more than $11.3 million to pay for advertisements praising at least 21 members of Congress. <a href=""http://www.americasagenda-kidshealth.org/"">AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Agenda: Health Care for Kids Inc.</a>, an advocacy group that backs the expanding of the State ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), paid to air the ads on or around Sept. 12, 2007 in states across the country. America's Agenda got the funds to pay for the ads from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), <a href=""http://images.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C30001150"">documents filed with the Federal Election Commission reveal.</a></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""http://www.phrma.org/"">PhRMA</a>, whose members include most of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the country, is headed by a former member of Congress, Billy Tauzin, R-La. PhRMA lobbied Congress and the executive branch on SCHIP in the past year.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">NPR's Secret Money project <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/secretmoney/2008/09/pharma_pumps_big_money_into_ad.html"">noted</a> that the ad supported eight members of the Senate who supported SChip expansion; similarly, all the House members the ad supported--Reps. Harry Mitchell, D-Ariz., Gabrielle Giffords,  D-Ariz., Jerry McNerney, D-Calif., Tim Mahoney, D-Minn., Baron Hill, D-Ind., John Yarmuth, D-Ken., Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Jason Altmire, D-Pa., Chris Carney, D-Pa., Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., Steve Kagan, D-Wis. -- voted to <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h3963/show"">override President George W. Bush's veto</a> of SCHIP expansion in Jan. 2008.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Political nonprofits--527s and 501(c)4s--can receive unlimited funds from individuals, corporations and labor unions. While they cannot expressly advocate the election or defeat of a particular candidate, they can run ads that criticize or praise candidates for federal office. The Real Time 527 widget makes it easy to get to the records that show who's behind the ads.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Unfortunately, the FEC does not require the reports to be electronically filed (as noted, some of them are hand written). To determine which candidate is mentioned or what donors are disclosed on a form, users must follow the link to the filings. Note also that on the FEC disclosure page, many of the filings are amendments. The Real Time 527 widget only captures new filings, not amendments.</p>

The opening includes this passage:

<blockquote>But in many situations the right course of action is not always obvious. So here are some questions that we can ask ourselves to help us navigate the shades of gray:</blockquote>

The first shade of gray?

<blockquote>Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Is the action legal?</blockquote>

In fairness, the preceding sentence tells employees, ""Perhaps most importantly, our Code not only requires us to comply with the law, but it challenges us to promote ethical conduct in all that we do."" And of course, corporate ethics manuals rarely read like Aristotle. Still, it's an unfortunate phrasing.

It was also jarring to read this violation of the code of conduct:

<blockquote>Offering, promising, paying or giving anything of value Ã¢â‚¬â€ directly or indirectly Ã¢â‚¬â€ either to a government employee or official, or to a foreign official, foreign political party, party official, candidate or their staff, in a manner inconsistent with applicable law or Policy</blockquote>

Showering campaign contributions consistent with the Federal Election laws on <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/09/congressmen-may-have-lost-17-m.html"">members of Congress</a>, on the other hand, was apparently just fine.

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span><o:p></o:p>Kohring, Weyhrauch and Kott have all pled not guilty, and Kohring has returned to his duties in the <st1:state w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Alaska</st1:place></st1:state> legislature.</span></p>
<span><o:p></o:p></span><span>I talked to <a href=""http://www.andrewhalcro.com/"">Andrew Halcro</a>, a former Republican lawmaker whoÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s been very critical of his party and the influence that VecoÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®which is a top political donor in the state as well as a formidable lobbying presenceÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®wields over it. Halcro served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1999 to 2003, and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2006, losing in a primary to Sarah Palin, who also went on to win the general election. <o:p></o:p></span>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span><o:p></o:p>As a state lawmaker, Halcro was in position to observe the work of Veco executives in the state capitol. I interviewed him to get his take on the recent events; Halcro revealed that VecoÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s Bill Allen and Rick Smith had unfettered access to everyone in the stateÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s legislature and were commonly seen in the hallways around the building. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Halcro shared some of his personal experiences:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em><span>I was elected in November 1998 to the state house and ran as a Republican. At the time, Veco was a big contractor and even to this day they are the Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºbackbone of the people.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ They had built themselves up into this special interest group and they helped first time campaigners and got them to lean on their funding. <o:p></o:p></span></em></p>
<em><span>My real experience with them was two days after getting elected  Veco had had a fundraising luncheon for me and raised about $3,000 which was 10 percent of [my] total contributions. We were to choose the party leadership that day and I get a call from Bill Allen who says, Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºPete Kott should be chosen as the Speaker.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ I said that this was inappropriate and he bluntly told me that he had given me money when I was campaigning.</span></em>

<span>Halcro believes that he was not the only one Veco contacted during the period and that company officials also approached other first-term legislators.<o:p></o:p></span>

<span><o:p></o:p></span>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Veco has also made campaign contributions to federal as well as state elected officials, including the three members of AlaskaÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s congressional delegation, Sen. Ted Stevens, Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Rep. Don Young, plus members from other states, including Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., and Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. (<a href=""http://www.capitaleye.org/inside.asp?ID=263"">The full story and list from the Center for Responsive Politics is here</a>.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<span>Halcro noted that most of the legislators that took large contributions from Veco also support oil-drilling projects in <st1:state w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Alaska</st1:place></st1:state>, the top legislative priority of the company. <o:p></o:p></span>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Halcro also recalled how the entire scandal got started. He said: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span><o:p></o:p></span><em><span>These guys wanted a $700 million tax credit on an oil tax and they didnÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´t want it to be more than 20 percent but it was finally set at 22.5 percent with a possibility of an increase. In my last year [in the state house] 2002, Bill Allen and Rick Smith, who were not registered as lobbyists, lobbied for the tax bill and were fined. So, they came back the next year and changed the law in 2003. They were so brazen about it. They would even pass notes over the balcony.<o:p></o:p></span></em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Halcro added that <st1:state w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Alaska</st1:place></st1:state>Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s government was ill-equipped to prevent the scandal.<span>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em><span>The main problem is that the internal public watchdog process in the state is under funded and for 10 years, the Republicans have been in power there has been no tightening of campaign finance regulations. <o:p></o:p></span></em></p>

<blockquote>Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., pressed for passage, with the alarming news that one of the country's premier insurance companies was about to go bankrupt if the crisis was not quickly resolved.

""We don't have a lot of leeway on time,"" Reid told reporters in the Capitol. ""One of the individuals in the caucus today talked about a major insurance company -- a major insurance company -- one with a name that everyone knows that's on the verge of going bankrupt. That's what this is all about.""

He did not identify the insurance company, and later in the day Reid spokesman Jim Manley said the senator was speaking broadly and not referring to anything specific.

""Senator Reid is not personally aware of any particular company being on the verge of bankruptcy,"" Manley wrote in an e-mail to ABCNews.com. ""Rather, his comments were meant to refer to the conditions in the financial sector generally. He regrets any confusion his comments may have caused.""</blockquote>

In other words, passing on unconfirmed, unsubstantiated anecdotes on hearsay is to be understood as a reasoned, dispassionate econometric analysis of current financial conditions based on multiple data points.

<blockquote>Note that Mr. PaulsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proposal was not intended to solve the teaser-rate mortgage problem, either now or in the future. In the transactions that created the teaser-rate mortgages in the first place, both parties made bad decisions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the lender and the borrower. Mr. PaulsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proposal was not intended to help either. One of its unavoidable side effects, however, was to relieve lenders of the consequences of their bad decisions, while leaving borrowers to suffer the consequences of theirs. This made it politically less palatable.

In addition, at least $500 billion more of teaser-rate mortgages are scheduled to reset over the next several years. In all likelihood, they too will go into default and become toxic waste. Nothing in Mr. PaulsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original proposal was intended to do anything about this next $500 billion installment Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or, indeed, to prevent lenders from making more teaser-rate mortgages in the future.</blockquote>

When you read figures like this -- $500 billion of teaser-rate mortgages -- how do you track down the sources they're based on? Today I'll spend a little time taking a look at these underlying numbers."		2008-10-02 12:46:34	2008-10-02 12:46:34	2008-10-02 12:46:34	1	0	1

<!--[endif]-->In 2005, Azerbaijan, an oil-rich country in the Caucuses that regained its independence when the Soviet Union collapsed, hired the Livingston Group, a well-connected Washington firm, to lobby on various issues ranging from human rights to trade and procuring funding. Over the last three years, representatives of the country have lobbied on the re-authorization of Export-Import Bank financing and security concerns in the region, meeting with several members of Congress along the way to push their agenda.

With influential lobbyists such as Bob Livingston heading their team, AzerbaijanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s government had access to some of the most powerful people in Washington. For instance, at a meeting with Vice President Richard Cheney, Livingston petitioned to add an attachÃƒÂ© from the Department of Commerce to the U.S. embassy in Azerbaijan. They have also enlisted LivingstonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aid in organizing the U.S.-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce, working with the United States on building an oil pipeline, and getting oil companies including BP to invest in the region.Ã‚Â And theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve paid well for the service: In the past two years alone the country has spent more than $680,000 in fees and expenses to the Livingston Group.

Getting to that data, however, is a time consuming, difficult process. The Foreign Agent Registration Information System, maintained by the Department of Justice, has an <a href=""http://www.fara.gov/"">online database</a> that provides users with access, through a balky search engine, to filings by foreign agents in a pdf format. Lobbyists for foreign entitiesÃ¢â‚¬â€including foreign governments and government-controlled entitiesÃ¢â‚¬â€must, under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA), disclose their political activities, such as their meetings with U.S. government officials, the matters they discuss with them, and their campaign contributions to political candidates.

Sunlight decided to take a <a href=""http://fara.sunlightlabs.com/"">sampling of those filings</a>Ã¢â‚¬â€covering all the lobbying activity disclosed by foreign agents representing 15 countriesÃ¢â‚¬â€and put it online in a digital format. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re presenting this slice of data in a searchable format, showing the activities of the lobbyists for 15 countries, their contacts with government officials and the $67 million in fees and expenses theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve reported. The records collected and presented here show that some issues frequently appear, including trade, human rights and monetary aid; they also show that countries promote author events at the Library of Congress and raise the programming choices of the Public Broadcasting System with members of Congress.

<strong>Top foreign lobbying issues</strong>

The data gives a sense of how lobbying campaigns operate, and how members of Congress respond to them. <a href=""http://fara.sunlightfoundation.com/legislator/Kyl%2C%20Jon%20(R-AZ)/"">Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.</a>, for example, introduced a resolution advocating a free trade agreement between the United States and Taiwan on Mar. 28, 2006, more than a month after his staffer met with lobbyists representing the country. Lobbyists for Taiwan then made contacts with at least 19 other members of Congress in 2006 to discuss the same resolution. In the past three years alone, Taiwan has hired 13 lobbyists and paid more than $7 million in fees and compensation to these firms.

Taiwan had access to some of the most powerful members of Congress including Republican presidential nominee <a href=""http://fara.sunlightlabs.com/legislator/McCain%2C%20John%20(R-AZ)/"">Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.</a><a href=""http://fara.sunlightlabs.com/legislator/McCain%2C%20John%20(R-AZ)/""> </a>In July 2006, Randy Scheunemann, then with Orion Strategies, met with the Arizona Senator to discuss <a href=""http://fara.sunlightlabs.com/client/Taiwan/"">Taiwan </a>related issues. Scheunemann has since joined McCain's presidential campaign as a foreign policy adviser. McCain's presidential campaign has been plagued with reports of lobbyists working for foreign governments, including Tom Loeffler. Loeffler served as co-chairman of the McCain campaign while his firm represented the Saudi government; Loeffler had contacted McCain on behalf of his client a few months before joining the campaign.Ã‚Â  Although, Loeffler resigned from the campaign soon after these reports, Scheunemann continues as McCain's foreign policy adviser. According to FARA reports, lobbyists for these 15 countries contributed $97,000 to McCain from the latter part of 2005 to the end of 2007.

The staff of <a href=""http://fara.sunlightlabs.com/legislator/Obama%2C%20Barack%20(D-IL)/"">Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill.</a>, the Democratic nominee, has also had contacts with lobbyists who have registered under FARA. One of his staffers met with Lydia Borland of the Livingston Group Ã¢â‚¬Å“to discuss the current status of U.S./Azerbaijan relationsÃ¢â‚¬Â. There were four other contacts with another member of Obama's staff to discuss the IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â€œU.S. nuclear agreement. Lobbyists for these countries disclosed giving $11,000 to ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s campaign on their FARA supplemental forms.

While some countries push for a certain legislation to be sponsored or passed, others lobby to dissuade Congress to support a bill or sometimes alter it. For example, when Nancy Pelosi decided to seek a house vote to pass a resolution that would formally label the murder of hundreds of thousands of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century as genocide, Turkey spent almost $600,000 to flood Capitol Hill with lobbyists who sought to block the resolution.

While lobbying for federal funding is hardly new to Washington, even for foreign agents, in recent years, FARA filings have shown that some countries, especially Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, are directly referring to military funding in their lobbying disclosures.

Lobbyists for <a href=""http://fara.sunlightfoundation.com/client/Pakistan/"">Pakistan</a> pushed for various bills related to monetary aid to the country in a counter-terrorism bill. They hired Van Scoyoc to lobby on the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act. This bill provides U.S. Agency for International Development support for Pakistan and also promises a Ã¢â‚¬Å“long term strategic partnershipÃ¢â‚¬Â between the two countries. The bill also Ã¢â‚¬Å“authorizes appropriations for security assistance for Pakistan for FY2008Ã¢â‚¬Â and extends Ã¢â‚¬Å“presidential authority to waive foreign assistance restrictions regarding Pakistan for FY2007-FY2008.Ã¢â‚¬Â

<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In June, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., along with Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., introduced legislation that aimed at closing a few loopholes in the FARA. If it passes, it would require lobbyists for any foreign entity to register with FARA even if they are registered under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (lobbyists for most foreign corporations can file under the LDA, avoiding the more detailed reporting requirements of FARA). The Closing the Foreign Lobbying Loophole Act, as it is titled, will also mandate disclosing all lobbying activities that occur outside the United   States.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Yet the act does not require foreign agents to file electronically, or require the Justice Dept. to improve its public disclosure of these detailed records of outside influence on Washington.</p>

467	Prosecutorial Misconduct in the Stevens Trial?	prosecutorial-misconduct-in-the-stevens-trial	2	"The Washington Post <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/02/AR2008100201492.html?hpid=topnews"">reports</a>  that defense attorneys for Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, have accused prosecutors of withholding potentially exculpatory information. It appears that the judge hearing the case agrees:

<blockquote>U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan said the powerful 40-year senator ""would not be getting a fair trial if it were up to the government."" He halted trial testimony so lawyers could prepare for a 4:30 p.m. hearing on motions to end the case or impose sanctions on the government. </blockquote>

The indictment against Stevens <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2008/07/29/pro-publica-gets-stevens-indictment-online/"">seemed weak</a> -- arguing that Stevens had failed to disclose information about his residence on his personal financial disclosure (residences are <a href=""http://www.washingtonwatch.com/blog/2008/07/30/did-senator-stevens-indictment-expose-a-loophole/"">pretty much exempt</a> from disclosure, but there is an effort to <a href=""http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/110_HR_6644.html"">change that</a>). 

Prosecutorial misconduct doesn't get nearly enough attention. The Center for Public Integrity did a massive project on local prosecutors available <a href=""http://www.publicintegrity.org/projects/entry/299/"">here</a>, but someone should take a look at federal prosecutors as well. The problem, as the CPI study notes, is that unaddressed misconduct puts innocent people in prison, while misconduct discovered often leaves potentially guilty folks on the street."		2008-10-02 16:37:56	2008-10-02 16:37:56	2008-10-02 16:37:56	1	0	1

When Anu and I started this project, our sense was and still is that constituents should be aware of what members of Congress do in Washington. In addition to overseeing executive branch agencies through their committees, members individually write to them--often on behalf of constituents--inquiring about matters before the agencies.

That's pretty much what the Office of Administrative Law Judges correspondence shows--the bulk of the letters, 37 out of 40, request information on the status of black lung claims made by constituents. (""Hearings concerning black lung benefits and longshore workers' compensation constitute the largest part of the office's work,"" according to its <a href=""http://www.oalj.dol.gov/ALJMISSN.HTM"">Web site</a>.) There was also one letter inquiring about back wages owed to San Diego-area security guards which was fowarded to the Associate Solicitor of Fair Labor Standards, a letter about a worker's compensation claim and another giving information for an OSHA case.

Rep. Rick Boucher inquired about the most cases--he sent 19 letters, plus a fax requesting updates on 7 other cases--followed by Rep. Harold Rodgers and Rep. Nick J. Rahall II (6 each). FedSpending.org shows that Rahall, Rodgers and Boucher's districts are <a href=""http://www.fedspending.org/faads/faads.php?&amp;sortby=r&amp;record_num=all&amp;detail=-1&amp;datype=T&amp;reptype=a&amp;database=faads&amp;cfda_program_num=17.307#searchcriteria"">one, two and three</a> in terms of dollar amounts for federal assistance for <a href=""http://12.46.245.173/pls/portal30/CATALOG.PROGRAM_TEXT_RPT.SHOW?p_arg_names=prog_nbr&amp;p_arg_values=17.307"">Coal Mine Workers' Compensation</a>, which provides ""benefits to coal miners who have become totally disabled due to coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP), and to widows and other surviving dependents of miners who have died of this disease.""

The log covers two months of congressional correspondence--it will be interesting to see, as we get more information from the Office of Administrative Law Judges in the coming months--if this actually represents a pattern, or is just a statistical blip. It's also interesting that there are no letters about longshore workers' compensation claims--I have no idea why not.

I'm going to write a bit more on the individual letters a little later."		2007-05-23 20:16:47	2007-05-23 20:42:51	2007-05-23 20:16:47	1	0	1

<p class=""MsoNormal"">In late July this year, two North Carolina state legislators and a pharmaceutical industry executive set up a political non-profit to run ads focusing on the present financial crisis ahead of the November election. The  nonprofit has spent more than $600,000 to produce the ads, according to <a href=""http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ec_table.shtml"">documents filed with the Federal Election Commission</a>.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Real Time has been following various ads using our new ""Follow the 527s"" widget, available on the right side of the site.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The nonprofit, <a href=""http://rightchange.com/"">RightChange.com</a>, Inc., was set up by a pair Republican lawmakers, state Sen. Fletcher Hartsell, Jr. and state Rep. Jeff Barnhart. At least $2.75 million of the money used to fund the ads comes from Fred Eshelman, a local entrepreneur and CEO of <a href=""http://www.ppdi.com/"">Pharmaceutical Product Development</a>, a company based in Wilmington, N.C. Ernest Mario, who serves on the board of Pharmaceutical Product Development, contributed $1 million.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">On Sept. 30, RightChange submitted documents to the FEC disclosing that Eshelman made donations to the nonprofit to pay for two ads, titled Ã¢â‚¬ËœAngryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœFought Reform,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ which were paid for with the donations from Eshelman and Mario.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In addition to RightChange.com, the two North Carolina lawmakers have another connection to Eshelman and Mario. Last year, Hartsell sponsored state funding for a bio-tech research center jointly funded by taxpayer dollars and private businesses. The amount of public funding for the project, the <a href=""http://www.ncresearchcampus.net/"">North Carolina Research Campus </a>in Kannapolis, N.C.,  became a contentious issue; the House proposed spending only $1 million. Ultimately, Hartsell's measure, which called for $26 million for the campus, was approved in August 2007.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In April 2008, EshelmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s company put out <a href=""http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/PPDI/435645808x0x186369/b9092e4e-6526-4e27-9c7f-3e999125eff0/PPDI_News_2008_4_9_General.pdf"">this</a> press release saying that Pharmaceutical Product Development was opening an office at the Kannapolis facility which will bring jobs to the area by attracting researchers and bio-tech experts.</p>

Hartsell and Barnhart started another nonprofit, Alliance for Tomorrow,  to promote the research campus. According to news reports in the <em>Charlotte Observer,</em> the nonprofit does not disclose the identity of its donors. The group<strong> </strong>Ã¢â‚¬Å“achieved notoriety for advocating for the use of Tax Increment Financing,"" -- which earmarks property taxes for specific development projects -- ""and because its own source of funding is unknown,Ã¢â‚¬Â the paper reported."		2008-10-14 14:50:40	2008-10-14 14:50:40	2008-10-14 14:50:40	1	0	1

512	Does Congress think Detroit is a good investment?	does-congress-think-detroit-is-a-good-investment	2	"It appears that &lt;a href=""http://apnews.myway.com/article/20081117/D94GUIK80.html""&gt;the auto bailout&lt;/a&gt; is stalled for now, as congressional leadership and the Bush administration have come to loggerheads over providing $25 to $50 billion in loans to General Motors, Ford Motor Company, and Chrysler.

I found it interesting that, as of December 2007 (the most recent date for which disclosures are available), just 27 of the 535 members of Congress owned stock in at least one of the big three automakers, according to &lt;a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org""&gt;Open Secrets&lt;/a&gt;. They disclosed holdings worth between $755,000 and $1,866,000. Exclude Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., from the list (his wife is on &lt;a href=""http://nalert.blogspot.com/2008/11/john-dingells-wife-on-gm-payroll.html""&gt;GM's payroll&lt;/a&gt; and presumably the source of his $650,000 to $1.35 million in General Motors stock), and the numbers drop to a low range of $104,600 and a high range of $516,000--an average of between about $4,000 and $20,000.

By contrast, 90 members reported owning between $11.3 million and $32.8 million in stock from General Electric, which was the most popular investment.

It would appear that moving a bailout for Detroit, with the exception of Rep. Dingell, doesn't represent much in the way of a conflict of interest for most members. The 12 members who invested in General Motors are &lt;a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/search_results_detail.php?filtertype=H&amp;year=2007&amp;org=General+Motors&amp;srchorg=GENERAL+MOTORS&amp;srchtype=O""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, the 18 who invested in Ford are &lt;a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/search_results_detail.php?filtertype=H&amp;year=2007&amp;org=Ford+Motor+Co&amp;srchorg=FORD&amp;srchtype=O""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the 3 who invested in Chrysler are &lt;a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/search_results_detail.php?filtertype=H&amp;year=2007&amp;org=Chrysler+LLC&amp;srchorg=CHRYSLER&amp;srchtype=O""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).

<!--[endif]-->In February 2006, a lobbyist met with members of Congress to inform them that a foreign company, partially owned by the government of Dubai, had won federal approval for a deal that could adversely affect national security. Soon members of both parties were criticizing the dealÃ¢â‚¬â€and the federal regulators who approved itÃ¢â‚¬â€through which DP World acquired stevedoring operations at six U.S. ports. As a result of the widespread criticism over a foreign-government-owned firm Ã¢â‚¬Å“runningÃ¢â‚¬Â U.S. port facilities, DP World cancelled that part of its deal, selling the port contracts to AIG Global Investment Group.

In March 2007, lobbyists met with members of CongressÃ¢â‚¬â€including some who had vigorously objected to the DP World dealÃ¢â‚¬â€to inform them that a foreign company, partially owned by the government of Dubai, sought federal approval for a deal that could adversely affect national security. In July 2007, lobbyists informed the chiefs of staff of Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., and Rep. Peter King, R-NY., that federal regulators had signed off on Dubai Aerospace EnterpriseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acquisition of a pair of firms with operations at U.S. and Canadian airports, Landmark Aviation and Standard Aero Holdings. This time, members were silent. No objections to the deal were raised.

A little more than a year after DP WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s federally approved acquisition of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company unraveled, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise (DAE) won approval for its acquisition of a pair of companies owned by the Carlyle Group. One key difference between the deals: While both firms mounted expensive lobbying campaigns, DP World didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hire its first lobbyist until Feb. 15, 2006Ã¢â‚¬â€two days after Sen. Charles Schumer, D-NY, ignited a national controversy by charging that U.S. ports were being turned over to <a href=""http://schumer.senate.gov/SchumerWebsite/schumer_around_ny/record.cfm?id=259428&amp;"">Ã¢â‚¬Å“a country that has been linked to terrorism.Ã¢â‚¬Â</a> By contrast, DAE launched an early and intensive campaign conducted by three top Washington lobbying shops, the Glover Park Group, Quinn Gillespie &amp; Associates and MWW Group, to smooth its path through Congress.

By using disclosures required under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which require firms lobbying for foreign political parties, governments and government owned organizationsÃ¢â‚¬â€including for-profit companiesÃ¢â‚¬â€to list their meetings with government officials, it is possible to trace part of the campaign to win approval for the deal. The Sunlight Foundation released a <a href=""http://fara.sunlightfoundation.com/"">prototype database</a> with records from lobbyists for 15 countries, which was used in this report.

FARA records show that Glover Park Group was active early. Lobbyists from the firm first met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's national security adviser, then with staffers from the House Intelligence Committee. Lobbyists working on behalf of DAE also made early contacts with Rep. Peter King, R-NY. Both Pelosi and King had opposed the Dubai Ports deal.

At least another seven contacts were made during March with the offices of Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., and Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., both of whom questioned the DP World ports deal. In all, the Glover Park Group made contacts at least 18 times during the month of March.

Lobbyists for DAE began seeking the support of members of Congress in March 2007Ã¢â‚¬â€before a formal deal to purchase the two aviation firms hammered out. The company was joined in its efforts by the Carlyle Group and trade groups including the U.S.-U.A.E. Business Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Overall, DAE spent $780,000 on lobbyists between February 2007 and August 2008.

<strong>Surviving CFIUS</strong>

In addition to winning congressional support, DAEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lobbyists had another hurdle to clear: a review process conducted by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which approves all acquisitions of by international companies or foreign states acquiring U.S. businesses. CFIUS, an interagency group that includes representatives from Treasury, Homeland Security, Justice, Defense and Commerce, is chaired by the Secretary of Treasury.

The lawyers of the firms voluntarily file papers with the Treasury for the review and investigation process; none of the documents submitted by a company for review by CFIUS is ever made public. Documents generated by the evaluators are also not available to the public, even with a FOIA request. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department refused to even comment on any specific transaction, stating that each case involves highly sensitive corporate and financial information about the company.

<span>After the DP World controversy, Congress re-evaluated the CFIUS process and passed legislation --</span> the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007, or FINSA --<span> that increased the number of people scrutinizing each case and added more congressional oversight. According to lawyers whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve followed the changes, the new rules expand the scope and the intensity of the CFIUS process. </span>

Ã¢â‚¬Å“There are two levels of inquiry: the review and the investigation and in specific cases there is an additional 45 day investigation,Ã¢â‚¬Â David Gallacher, an associate lawyer with Sheppard Mullin Richter &amp; Hampton LLP said. Gallacher who has followed the CFIUS changes and written about the changes on his firmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Web site, says that the 45-day investigations will take place if the company is foreign government owned and if there are national security concerns.

DAEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s purchase of the pair of companies that provided aircraft maintenance would seem to require additional screening on both grounds. In March 2007, when Schumer learned that talks were underway between DAE and Carlyle, he said of the potential acquisition, Ã¢â‚¬Å“because it deals with maintenance of aircraft it certainly raises security questions,Ã¢â‚¬Â according the <a href=""http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/03/20/business/dubai.php"">International Herald Tribune. </a>

Yet DAEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acquisition faced no additional scrutiny. Congress passed the final version of FINSA on July 11, 2007. A week later, on July 18, Congress formally submitted the bill to President Bush for his signature or veto. A day later, on July 19, 2007, lobbyists for DAE contacted the chiefs of staff of Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., and Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y. to report that CFIUS had signed off on the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deal with the Carlyle Group.

Bush signed FINSA on July 26, and the bill took effect three months later, on October 24, long after DAEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acquisition was a done deal.

CFIUS does have an evergreen provision that allows the U.S. government to suspend a deal at any time if federal agencies find that a company is violating terms under which the deal was approved. DAE divested parts of the companies it acquired and merged the rest as a business enterprise within its engineering arm; the final transaction with Carlyle was estimated at $1.9 billion.

<strong>Re-tracing the lobbying campaign</strong>

Though DAE didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t formally announce its intent to purchase the two aviation services firms from the Carlyle Group until April 2, 2007, its agents in Washington were approaching members of Congress in March. In addition to contacting staffers from the offices of Pelosi, King, Emanuel and Dodd, lobbyists from Glover Park Group met with the chiefs of staff of Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Rep. Eddie Johnson, D-Texas.

Glover Park Group lobbyists contributed to the campaigns of King, Webb, Dorgan and Whitehouse. Though the firmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s FARA disclosures do not reveal which lobbyist met with the lawmakers or their staffs, Kevin Fogarty, the chief of staff to King, said in a phone interview he met with Susan Brophy. FARA filings reveal that three days prior to her meeting with Fogarty,<strong> </strong><span>Brophy</span> made a contribution of $500 to his bossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s campaign. King is <span>the ranking member on the House Committee for Homeland Security.</span>

Glover Park Group lobbyists contacted at least three people on the House Financial Services Committee, which had oversight over CFIUS, including its chairman, Rep. Barney Frank. In the wake of the DP World ports controversy, Frank pushed for additional oversight of the CFIUS process. On February 28, 2007, he said in a <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/record.xpd?id=110-h20070228-26&amp;bill=h110-556#sMonofilemx003Ammx002Fmmx002Fmmx002Fmhomemx002Fmgovtrackmx002Fmdatamx002Fmusmx002Fm110mx002Fmcrmx002Fmh20070228-26.xmlElementm3m0m0m"">speech on the House floor</a>, Ã¢â‚¬Å“So the people of Dubai should have been told, look, we mean you no ill, but we think it is a mistake for you to buy these ports. There are, I would have thought, many other investments I think they could have made.Ã¢â‚¬Â

On March 13, 2007, lobbyists for DAE met with Frank; on March 27, two lobbyists for Glover Group each made $1,000 contributions to FrankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s campaign. Frank raised no public objections to the DAE deal.

<span>Susan Brophy was one of the two contributors to Frank; sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s had a long standing alliance with a few members of Congress, including Dorgan, for whom she worked for as an aid. She has also worked in the Clinton White House as the Deputy Director of Legislative Affairs. </span>

<span>Between the first contact between Glover Park Group lobbyists on behalf of DAE on March 13, 2007 to the last, on July 19, Brophy wrote checks totaling $14,000 members of Congress, political action committees and party committees, including $1,000 checks to the presidential campaign of Dodd, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</span>

<span>According to David Christy, who practices international law with Miller and Chevalier, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not only campaign donations but about the various lengths that members will go for calling in the chips. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You've built a relationship over the years and they [lobbyists] build trust and members know they won't lie to them and misrepresent the issue. And most lobbyists have some contacts and some issues,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.</span>

<strong>A broader campaign</strong>

Foreign agents representing the United Arab Emirates, who also made contacts on behalf of DAE, also had longstanding relationships.<span> </span>David Hoppe, a lobbyist with Quinn Gillespie, was the chief of staff for Trent Lott between 1992 and 2002 when Lott was the Senate Republican Leader. Lobbyists from Quinn Gillespie met three times with Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the top Republican in the Senate, and once with Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., the Republican Whip.

<span>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Campaign finance and contributions builds up over time and contributions that happened 10 yrs ago are still valid,Ã¢â‚¬Â Christy said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“But more than single timely contributions, it's more about the relationships lobbyists have with particular lawmakers,Ã¢â‚¬Â he added.</span>

But tracking how lobbyists use those relationships without the benefit of FARA filings is more difficult. This is especially true for DAEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s U.S. partners in the lobbying campaign, which disclose their activities under the Lobbying Disclosure Act which is administered by Congress. Unlike FARA filings, registrants under LDA are not required to specify their meetings with government officials.

Standard Aero hired the Spectrum Group and the Loeffler Group to lobby and Landmark aviation hired Akin Gump and lobbied on the DAE deal. The Carlyle Group, Standard Aero and Landmark Aviation spent more than $1.3 million on lobbyist, according to filings in the Senate Office of Public Records.

Dubai Aerospace Enterprise also hired one firm, MWW Group, which disclosed its activities under the Lobbying Disclosure Act. DAE hired the firm, which prides itself as a great PR company, to lobby Congress between April 2007 and February 2008.

The MWW Group lobbied on a pair of bills: FINSA and the Invest USA Act of 2007, which would have created a new organization within the Commerce Department called, the United States Direct Investment Administration. The legislation, introduced in March 2007, has languished in the Senate Finance Committee."		2008-11-18 19:20:17	2008-11-18 19:20:17	2008-11-18 19:20:17	1	0	1
526	Financial Bailout: Will Geithner Comply with Bloomberg's FOIA Request?	financial-bailout-will-geithner-comply-with-bloombergs-foia-request	2	"It's old news now: yesterday, President-elect Barack Obama announced he was picking <a href=""http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/11/25/business/25sorkin.php"">Timothy Geithner</a>, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as his Treasury Secretary. 

Geithner's New York Fed, according to <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aKr.oY2YKc2g"">Bloomberg.com</a>, has been ""accepting [securities from banks] on behalf of American taxpayers as collateral for $1.5 trillion of loans.

Bloomberg filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act for documents related to that $1.5 trillion worth of loans, and are now suing to get those documents. They were denied because,

<blockquote>Fed staff planned to recommend that Bloomberg's request be denied under an exemption protecting ``confidential commercial information,'' according to Alison Thro, the Fed's FOIA Service Center senior counsel. The Fed in Washington has about 30 pages pertaining to the request, Thro said today before the filing of the suit. The bulk of the documents Bloomberg sought are at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which she said isn't subject to the freedom of information law. </blockquote>

528	Financial Bailout: Do Interests of Automakers and Members Diverge?	financial-bailout-do-interests-of-automakers-and-members-diverge	2	"Reading the <a href=""http://gmfactsandfiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/restructuring-plan-for-long-term-viability.pdf"">restructuring plan</a> that General Motors put together makes me wonder whether, in a broad sense, there isn't an insuperable conflict of interest between members of Congress and the automakers. Consider just one aspect of the plan:

<blockquote>...the number of GM retailers is expected to decline to 4,700 by 2012. This will occur primarily in metropolitan and suburban areas where GM has too many dealers to serve the market. In the Plan, it is projected these dealers will be reduced by 35%, increasing annual throughput for the remaining outlets to a more competitive level with other high-volume manufacturers. GMÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs distribution strength in rural areas, which is a significant competitive advantage, will be largely preserved. GM intends to have the right number of brands, sold by the right number of dealers, in the right locations to obtain maximum profitability for GM and the retailer network.<blockquote>

There are currently 6,450 dealerships, so to get to the right number of dealers in the right locations, 1,750 dealerships will have to disappear. Presumably, most of the jobs at those dealerships would disappear with them. Using GM's online <a href=""http://www.gm.com/vehicles/dealer/"">dealer locator</a>, I made this <a href=""http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=37.0625,-95.677068&spn=43.037246,79.101563&z=4"">Google map</a> showing GM Dealerships within 10 miles of the Sunlight Foundation. The dozen dealerships (I'm counting the Saturn dealership at the same address as a Buick/Pontiac dealership as a single entity) which all serve the Washington D.C. metro area, are split among multiple congressional districts and a pair of states. Eliminating 35 percent of them leaves you with eight GM dealerships -- who loses out? Do you shut down the Cadillac dealership in Alexandria, Va., or Bethesda, Md? Or do you get rid of both, and sell Cadillacs from the Chevy dealership in Bethesda and the Saturn dealership in Alexandria? And if you're a member of Congress, are you pleased with a restructuring plan that could be eliminating employers in your district that, on average, <a href=""http://www.nada.org/NR/rdonlyres/0FE75B2C-69F0-4039-89FE-1366B5B86C97/0/NADAData08_no.pdf"">according to the National Auto Dealers Association</a>, have payrolls of $2.59 million? 

NADA, by the way, is no shrinking violet when it comes to influence. <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/usearch/searchresults_detailed.php?srch_term=National%20Auto%20Dealers%20Assn&type=O&cnt=474&filter=tm"">According to the Center for Responsive Politics</a>, it was among the top 20 contributors to a whopping 158 members of Congress in the 2008 election cycle. General Motors could <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/usearch/searchresults_detailed.php?srch_term=General%20Motors&#038;type=O&#038;cnt=46&#038;filter=tm"">say the same</a> of just 15 members, Ford <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/usearch/searchresults_detailed.php?srch_term=Ford%20Motor%20Co&#038;type=O&#038;cnt=41&#038;filter=tm"">of 13</a>, and Chrysler of none.

If you're a member of Congress, do you pressure GM to lay off the dealers (for whom state laws, in any case, offer numerous protections)? To take the 35 percent reduction of dealerships in the other fellow's district or state? Or do you proudly point out that you helped save General Motors (assuming, rather optimistically, that the company's restructuring will work precisely as planned) at the expense of a couple of employers who had big payrolls, were big advertisers in the local media, and whose PAC had been, once upon a time, a big contributor to your campaigns?"		2008-12-04 23:42:17	2008-12-04 23:42:17	2008-12-04 23:42:17	1	0	1

535	Unraveling Rangel	unraveling-rangel	2	"It's been interesting to watch the stories that have described multiple ethics problems for Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and someone identified by <i>The Hill</i> as the <a href=""http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/rangel-is--top-fundraiser-for-house-democrats-despite-ethics-allegations-2008-11-24.html"">top fundraiser</a> for House Democrats. The Washington Post seems to have kicked things off with a <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/07/14/ST2008071402637.html"">story</a> on July 14 saying that Rangel used official House stationary to solicit big donations for his Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at the City College of New York. There followed a series of revelations that he wasn't <a href=""http://www.nypost.com/seven/08312008/news/worldnews/tricky_charlies_carib_hideaway_126882.htm"">properly declaring income</a> on a <a href=""http://www.nypost.com/photos/galleries/news/worldnews/pp_20080831_rangel/photo11.htm"">vacation property</a> he owned in the Dominican Republic; that he benefited from having four rent controlled apartments (one of which he used as an office) in violation of New York City statutes; that he used taxpayer funds to lease an expensive car; that he had all but abandoned a car he owns, a Mercedes, in the House parking garage; that he inappropriately claimed a small tax deduction for having a primary residence in Washington, D.C., (his primary residence is in New York, leaving him ineligible for the D.C. tax break) and he used his campaign committee to funnel $80,000 to his son for performing little or no work on a Web site. The New York Times <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/nyregion/25rangel.html"">report</a> that Rangel killed a retroactive tax increase for a big donor to his Center for Public Service is the latest revelation, but it's <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/06/nyregion/06rangel.html?_r=1&hp"">one</a> of about a half dozen news organizations (the Washington Post, the <a href=""http://www.nypost.com/seven/09182008/news/regionalnews/big_wheel_benz_the_rules_129646.htm"">New Yor</a>k <a href=""http://www.nypost.com/seven/11232008/news/regionalnews/rangel_double_deal_140307.htm"">Post</a>, <a href=""http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1208/16219.html"">Politico</a>, and <a href=""http://wcbstv.com/seenon/car.lease.us.2.713776.html"">WCBS-TV</a> being the others) that have been following the story. I would suggest looking at <a href=""http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/?s=rangel+scandal"">Glenn Reynold's archives</a> to follow the story, but there are so many links that it's hard to keep up with (that's due to the extent of Rangel's troubles, and is not fault of Reynolds). 

A few thoughts on the stories we've seen to date: 

<b>Federal disclosures,</b> some of which are now easily accessible online so that any member of the public can get to them, have played a role in some of the stories. Information from Rangel's personal financial disclosure forms, for example, featured in the stories about his vacation home (Center for Responsive Politics puts those online in a <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/CIDsummary.php?CID=N00000964&year=2007"">digitized format</a>). CRP also puts up campaign committee expenditures--for both <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenddetail.php?cycle=2006&cmte=C00302588&name=Edisonian+Innovative+Works%2C+LLC"">PACs</a> and <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/expendetail.php?cid=N00000964&cycle=2006&name=Edisonian%20Innovative%20Works,%20LLC"">congressional campaigns</a>--those payments featured in Politico's story on Rangel using campaign cash to benefit his son's company. Finding information about the rental car (which members can use a portion of their House office expenses to lease) isn't so easy. Some House office expense data is <a href=""http://www.ntu.org/main/misc.php?MiscID=5"">available online</a> -- National Taxpayers Union puts it out (it's current through 2005). But NTU doesn't provide information on rental car expenses. You can find them buried in <a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/statementofdisbu20082unit"">this report</a> -- Rangel's car payments for his DeVille are on page 1087 of the 1188 page black and white PDF.

<b>Shoe leather</b> was important. It's pretty clear from reading that stories that the federal disclosures were just a part of the picture (and in some stories, no part at all). You can't get photos of Rangel lying out on a beach chair in front of his vacation property in the Dominican Republic from schedule III of a financial disclosure form. A lot of news organizations have invested resources to dig into Rangel. Which, given the financial strain the news industry is operating under, makes me wonder...

<b>Why Rangel?</b> And why now? He's a powerful member with ties to two cities with competitive media markets, but that was also true in 2007, 2006 and so on. I'm not complaining--I think every member should be scrutinized in the same way. It will be interesting to see how long reporters stick with this."		2008-12-16 22:44:57	2008-12-16 22:44:57	2008-12-16 22:44:57	1	0	1
536	Feds: Illinois Governor put Obama's Senate seat up for sale	feds-illinois-governor-put-obamas-senate-seat-up-for-sale	2	"Here's the summary from Congress Daily (subscription only): 

<blockquote>Federal prosecutors say Illinois Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich engaged in a ""staggering"" conspiracy to sell or trade the Senate seat vacated by President-elect Obama in return for jobs and other personal benefits for himself and his wife, Patti. Blogojevich and Chief of Staff John Harris were arrested this morning. A 76-page FBI affidavit said the 51-year-old Democratic governor was intercepted on court-authorized wiretaps over the last month conspiring to sell or trade the vacant Senate seat. ""I want to make money,"" the affidavit quotes the governor as saying. U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said in a statement this morning that ""the breadth of corruption laid out in these charges is staggering."" The charges, he said, ""allege that Blagojevich put a for sale sign on the naming of a United States senator."" A federal official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press that the allegations include that the governor took money from at least one individual in connection with naming a successor to Obama. Blagojevich is also accused of threatening to withhold state money from the Tribune Co. efforts to sell Wrigley Field and the Chicago Cubs unless the Chicago Tribune fired editorial board members who criticized the governor. It's one thing to try to sell a Senate seat, but even the most hardheaded pols know better than to pick a fight with folks who buy ink by the barrel.</blockquote>

My first reaction is that, if the charges are true, Blagojevich got lazy. Like some <a href=""http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Liberty-Property-Trust-Company-History.html"">Philly mobsters and pols</a> in the 1980s who tried to extort a developer for $1 million up front rather than get it the old fashioned way through kickbacks, inflated sweetheart contracts for friend, and other pettier forms of corruption, the Illinois governor opted for the one big payoff rather than patiently waiting for dozens of smaller ones. It will be interesting to see whether the legal defense is that U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald is attempting to criminalize olitics as usual, but that of course is a long way off..."		2008-12-09 16:52:54	2008-12-09 16:52:54	2008-12-09 16:52:54	1	0	1

543	New database brings transparency to tariff bills	new-database-brings-transparency-to-tariff-bills	2	"Though they likely won't become law in 2008, more than 800 bills that were introduced by 116 members of the House, that would cut taxes on imports by an estimated $1.1 billion, and that were specifically requested by 120 companies and organizations that would benefit from them, are still pending in the 110th Congress. The bills reduce or eliminate tariffs on everything from unicycles to storage batteries for hybrid cars, from hair fibers of the rare <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VicuÃƒÂ±a"">vicuÃƒÂ±a</a> to chemicals for making rodent poison. Of the named beneficiaries, 65 hired in-house or outside lobbyists that listed specific bills or tariff duty suspensions as issues they sought to influence, an analysis of records from the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), and the Senate Office of Public Records shows.

Like earmarks, tariff suspension bills generally benefit one firm. Unlike earmarks, members request tariff suspensions by introducing bills, which are <a href=""http://waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=printfriendly&id=6799"">referred to and vetted by</a> the House Ways and Means Committee, and in the Senate, to the Finance Committee. The bills are analyzed by USITC to determine how much money the tariff suspension will cost the Treasury and whether a U.S. manufacturer producing the same good would be harmed by lowering the tariff for a foreign competitor. Bills that pass muster with the committee and USITC are rolled into a single miscellaneous tariff bill. With the waning days of the 110th Congress devoted to the bailout of the financial industry and the three domestic automobile manufacturers, and no single tariff measure introduced in either chamber, it appears unlikely that Congress will enact these measures.

Real Time is releasing a searchable database of the House tariff bills introduced in the 110th Congress--built on DabbleDB--that allows users to search bills by member, beneficiary (called a proponent), with links back to original documents. The database currently can be accessed in three views: a <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/realtime/XqKHOtUa"">Main View</a>, showing bill number, title, sponsor, the name and location of the beneficiary, links to the USITC analysis and, if any, to comments received by Ways and Means. The Main View also shows the how much money USITC believes the bill, if passed, would cost the Treasury in 2009, and information on the beneficiary's lobbyists.

The <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/realtime/LsFruHMk"">Notes Mode</a> lets users see more detail about the suspension--mostly descriptions of the item or items being imported. The Notes Mode can be used to find that Ford Motor Co. which recently sought a bailout from Congress in order to preserve American manufacturing jobs, requested <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/realtime/LsFruHMk?keyword=Ford+Motor"">tariff suspensions</a> to allow it to import parts specially designed for hybrid cars, including batteries, steering columns, break assemblies, transaxles and converters, all of which were made in Japan.

Because 421 of the bills are extensions of prior tariff bills passed in the 109th Congress that were due to expire in 2009, the <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/realtime/zFdghRLc"">Prior Suspensions</a> view links current bills with previous sponsors, beneficiaries, and amounts of revenue forgone. The Prior Suspensions view shows that, while members of Congress change, tariff breaks continue. Rep. Steven Buyer, R-Ind., was voted out of office in 2006. Before losing his seat, Buyer sponsored more than 30 tariff suspensions for Dow Chemical and its subsidiaries. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/realtime/zFdghRLc?keyword=steve+buyer"">introduced bills extending</a> those tax breaks.  The Prior Suspension view also shows that tariff suspensions are a bipartisan affair. In his first two years in the Senate, President-elect Barack Obama sponsored seven bills that lowered import duties for NuFarms America Inc., a subsidiary of Australian pesticide manufacturer Nufarrms Ltd., by nearly $1 million in 2009. <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/realtime/zFdghRLc?keyword=barack+obama"">Extensions</a> of those tax breaks were introduced in the current Congress by Rep. Judy Biggert, a Republican.

By far, the biggest bill, both in terms of tax revenue forgone and number of supporters both in out of Congress, was the <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h3934/show"">Affordable Footwear Act</a>, introduced by Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., and co-sponsored by 157 other members. The House Ways and Means Committee received  more than 50 letters from companies groups that supported the bill, which, <a href=""http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/other/rel_doc/bill_reports/110c/hr3934.pdf"">according to the U.S. International Trade Commission</a>, would cost the Treasury $810 million in 2009 and $3.7 billion through 2013. Retailers, including Wal-Mart, Target, Rack Room Shoes and Payless, manufacturers ranging from the venerable Brown Shoe to upstarts like Nike, and trade organizations like the National Retail Federation, argued in <a href=""http://waysandmeans.house.gov/media/pdf/110/HR3934.pdf"">letters</a> supporting the measure that those savings would be passed on to consumers. Only three letters opposed the measure, from E.S. Originals of New York, Proculcar, a trade association representing the Mexican shoe industry, and the government of the Dominican Republic; the latter two feared that cheap imports from China would swamp their own footwear export industries, which are dependent on sales in the U.S. market.

Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., introduced a measure that would extend an existing tariff suspension on camel hair, saving the Warren Corporation, a Connecticut-based textile firm, the princely sum of $5.40 a year.

Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., was the most prolific tariff suspension bill writer, introducing 49, followed by Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., with 47 and Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., with 42. Some 34 members introduced a single bill. The Affordable Footwear Act made Crowley the biggest drain on the Treasury, followed by Tauscher ($179 million) and Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis. ($10 million).

Applied Materials LLC, a California-based firm that <a href=""http://www.appliedmaterials.com/about/index.html"">""creates and commercializes the nanomanufacturing technology that helps produce virtually every semiconductor chip and flat panel displays [sic] in the world""</a>, would benefit the most, saving an estimated $178 million in 2009. Subsidiaries of Bayer AG, the German conglomerate, benefited from 93 requests -- tops among those asking.

This database is a work in progress -- more on its methodology and links to its source material and downloadable data in a variety of formats later today. And one more important note: House rules introduced in the current Congress required a greater degree of transparency for tariff legislation, which greatly facilitated the building of the database."		2008-12-10 18:22:56	2008-12-10 18:22:56	2008-12-10 18:22:56	1	0	1

A few words on the <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/realtime/XqKHOtUa"">tariff suspensions database</a>...

The primary sources of data come from the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade (there's an Excel spread sheet available for download <a href=""http://waysandmeans.house.gov/MoreInfo.asp?section=41"">here</a> and the U.S. International Trade Commission (their analyses of miscellaneous tariff bills from the last decade are online <a href=""http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/other/rel_doc/bill_reports/index.htm"">here</a>). 

The Ways and Means spreadsheet listed the bill number and name, its sponsor, a link to the bill text in <a href=""http://thomas.loc.gov"">Thomas</a>, and a link to a file containing any comments the committee received about the bill (there are details on the commenting process <a href=""http://waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=printfriendly&id=6799"">here</a>).  USITC analyses of individual bills include the name and location of the proponent (that is, the company or organization requesting the suspension), a description of the item or items for which the tariff suspension is requested, its country or countries of origin, and estimates of how much that suspension will cost the Treasury over the life of the duty suspension. 

Some tariff bills extend previously granted suspensions, most of which are expiring at the end of 2009. Bills in the current Congress, the 110th, that extend tariff suspensions generally show a ""$0"" figure for 2009 revenue lost (there are a few exceptions) because USITC attributes lost revenue to the previous suspension. To find out how much 2009 revenue would be lost, I used the item description and, on occasion, Google, to search USITC's site for the analysis from the <a href=""http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/other/rel_doc/bill_reports/109c.htm"">109th Congress</a>. Often sponsors changed from Congress to Congress, as did proponents, on occasion, so the item in question was often the only reliable means of tracking suspensions from one Congress to the next.

I used DabbleDB to put the database together because it's cheap (and is free if you're willing to open the data up to anyone) and is reasonably serviceable, although the publishing options leave a little to be desired (I wish users could use the database to do things like subtotal columns -- something I can do when I'm logged in with my account). 

To download the data in a CSV file, click <a href=""http://realtime.dabbledb.com/publish/realtime/74b1fc1f-60de-4620-9c42-b78136ac288b/publicviewone.csv"">here</a>; to download it in JSON format, click <a href=""http://realtime.dabbledb.com/publish/realtime/74b1fc1f-60de-4620-9c42-b78136ac288b/publicviewone.json"">here</a>; it's also available in <a href=""http://realtime.dabbledb.com/publish/realtime/74b1fc1f-60de-4620-9c42-b78136ac288b/publicviewone.xls"">Excel</a>, although when I tried to download it, my spreadsheet had some formatting issues.

I started with the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.asp?strID=C00417584"">Penguin PAC</a> because I like Penguins. The first thing I did was to look at the <a href=""http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00417584"">original filings</a> at the <a href=""http:www.fec.gov"">Federal Election Commission Web site</a> (each CRP PAC page offers you a link to the PAC's filings at the FEC).

The source material is <a href=""http://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors/index.php?page=1"">here</a>, but I couldn't get into the first page (glad that Larry could).

It would be interesting to see what issues the donors are interested in, where they come from, what their own economic interests are, and whether these could potentially create conflicts of interest for Sen. Hillary Clinton, our next Secretary of State.

Contributors to the foundation include governments of Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Norway, Jamaica, Oman and Brunei have contributed, as have government lobbying arms like the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office -- we should be concerned that the government of Saudi Arabia has contributed somewhere between $10 and $25 million to a foundation run by the spouse of our highest ranking foreign policy official. 

Maybe I'll add some fields and some data if (that's often a big if) I have a little down time today or tomorrow. And feel free to add information in comments.

I should also note that disclosing this information isn't required by any law (but should be); the Obama transition and the Clintons themselves deserve some marks for releasing the information. But all these donations to presidential foundations--for Bushes as well as Clinton (and Carter) should be publicly disclosed.

57	National Endowment Letters Unsolicited	national-endowment-letters-unsolicited	2	"While I wait for word from Fraiola &amp; Associates on the Penguin PAC (see below), I thought I'd go through a five-inch tall stack of papers Anu got in response to a FOIA request for congressional correspondence logs from the <a href=""http://www.neh.gov/"">National Endowment of for the Humanities</a>. So far, what I've seen aren't letters from members of Congress, but rather, a March 16, 2007, letter NEH sent to the entire congressional delegations of states lucky enough to be blessed with NEH funding. The letters include ""a complete list of grants recently made in your state by the National Endowment for the Humanities,"" lists that have not yet been made public. ""We are pleased to be able to notify Members of the House and Senate of these awards in advance of their public release,"" the letter, from Bruce Cole, the chairman of NEH, states. Those lists <a href=""http://www.neh.gov/news/archive/20070419.html"">are online now</a>--and have been since April 19.

This is, I suppose, a matter of some interpretation, but in our view none of these letters was actually responsive to our FOIA request, which asked for logs of correspondence <em>from</em> members of Congress, and any agency <em>replies</em>. We did not ask for unsolicited letters sent by the agency to alert members noting its awarding of grant money to the member's constituents, although it's mildly interesting to see that NEH does this. I imagine they're not alone.

There are also some oddities -- the Texas House delegation, for example, has 32 members, all of whom got letters. Yet there are only four grantees (who will receive a total of $29,687)--surely the four grantees can't have addresses in all 32 districts. If the purpose of the letters is to inform members of constituents who will receive federal funding, one would think NEH might target the letters a little more precisely."		2007-06-01 15:21:47	2007-06-01 15:21:47	2007-06-01 15:21:47	1	0	1

<blockquote>An upstate New York developer donated $100,000 to former President Bill ClintonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foundation in November 2004, around the same time that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton helped secure millions of dollars in federal assistance for the businessmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mall project.

Mrs. Clinton helped enact legislation allowing the developer, Robert J. Congel, to use tax-exempt bonds to help finance the construction of the Destiny USA entertainment and shopping complex, an expansion of the Carousel Center in Syracuse.

Mrs. Clinton also helped secure a provision in a highway bill that set aside $5 million for Destiny USA roadway construction.

The bill with the tax-free bonds provision became law in October 2004, weeks before the donation, and the highway bill with the set-aside became law in August 2005, about nine months after the donation.</blockquote>

Looking at the <a href=""http://www.speaker.gov/blog/?p=1631"">Gavel Blog</a> of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, it appears that the disclosures may be less than meets the eye. Taking the new rules in order...

<blockquote>Posting Requests Online: To offer more opportunity for public scrutiny of member requests, members will be required to post information on their earmark requests on their websites at the time the request is made explaining the purpose of the earmark and why it is a valuable use of taxpayer funds.</blockquote>

Note that there's no mention of disclosing the <i>recipient</i> of the earmark. Congressman X can say he's requesting an earmark to buy $600 hammers for the Pentagon because they're critical for meeting the needs of the modern soldier without ever mentioning that Boondoggle Inc., his biggest contributor, is their manufacturer. <b>Update</b>: Tammy Hughes, an administrative aide with the House Appropriations Committee, said she believes that recipients <i>will</i> be disclosed. <b>end update</b>

<blockquote>Early Public Disclosure: To increase public scrutiny of committee decisions, earmark disclosure tables will be made publically [sic] available the same day as the House or Senate Subcommittee rather than Full Committee reports their bill or 24 hours before Full Committee consideration of appropriations legislation that has not been marked up by a Senate Subcommittee.</blockquote>

Only those who visited FARA's New York Ave. office  here in Washington, D.C., between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. Monday through Friday  (closed Federal holidays), and looked up the records on balky, user-unfriendly  interface, could get them, and only those prepared to pay 50 cents a page to  copy them could get them out of that office.

(Our friends at <a href=""http://www.taxpayer.net"">Taxpayers for Common Sense</a> told us they had heard the same thing). 

Still under discussion is whether requests will be disclosed in a standardized format or <a href=""http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/01/06/inouye-obey-promise-earmark-reforms/#comment-49336"">however members choose</a> to release it."		2009-01-08 20:23:21	2009-01-08 20:23:21	2009-01-08 20:23:21	1	0	1
594	Greasing the stimulus with pork?	greasing-the-stimulus-with-pork	2	"Glenn Reynolds <a href=""http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/66109/"">flags</a> the <a href=""http://www.rollcall.com/issues/54_70/news/31234-1.html"">latest twist</a> on earmarks -- we'll have them, but call them something else:

<blockquote>At some point, [House Majority Whip James] Clyburn [(D-S.C.)] noted, there will be a list of projects funded by the package, and Members want to have input.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“The list is going to come from somewhere,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said.

House Appropriations ranking member Jerry Lewis (R-Calif.) questioned whether the bill can truly be considered free of earmarks when it will be loaded up with complicated formulas directing spending.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Calling it an earmark-free thing and then saying there are established formulas doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sound very earmark-free to me,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Lewis, who noted that the funding will lead to a list of local projects either way.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Are those earmarks even though the president says they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t? What are they then?Ã¢â‚¬Â

Kirstin Brost, spokeswoman for Appropriations Chairman David Obey (D-Wis.), acknowledged that Obey has been meeting with Members to hear their concerns, but she said Obey is maintaining a strict no-earmark policy that will prevent lawmakers from naming any specific project.</blockquote>

A few thoughts: When I trained reporters on earmarks last year, one of the questions I was frequently asked went something like this, ""Well, look, my member only got $4 million in earmarks total--it's not a lot of money. Why should I (or my readers) care?"" The reason we should care is that, for many members, earmarks become the main focus of their attention. It's not the $800 billion stimulus (or adding trillions of unpaid-for spending to the deficit) that commands their attention. Instead, they're fixated on the $3 or $4 million they'll bring home to their districts (accompanied with glowing press releases and photo ops with <a href=""http://pictopia.com/perl/ptp/pom_2626/?ptp_photo_id=2407396"">giant checks</a>...). Even in matters of war and peace, members can be <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-03-22-senate-funding-deadline_N.htm"">counted on</a> to put parochial interests first--to be swayed by the allure of the big check:

<blockquote>To entice support from wavering members, Democratic leaders included in the bill billions of dollars on such unrelated matters as support for spinach growers and peanut storage.</blockquote>

So it's not surprising that leadership would want the ability to include earmarks in the stimulus--that's how Congress works, after all. I suspect that trying to pass a stimulus bill without earmarks would be like trying to start an engine without oil. 

The means of hiding the pork -- the formulas -- can take many forms. Here's one possibility, from some transition rules in the Internal Revenue Code (culled from <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=Texas&url=/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000168----000-notes.html"">here</a>):

<blockquote>(K) A project is described in this subparagraph ifÃ¢â‚¬â€
Ã¢â‚¬Å“(i) the project involves a joint venture between a utility company and a paper company for a supercalendered paper mill, and at least $50,000,000 was incurred or committed with respect to such project before March 1, 1986, or
Ã¢â‚¬Å“(ii) the project involves a paper mill for the manufacture of newsprint (including a cogeneration facility) is generally based on a written design and feasibility study that was completed on December 15, 1981, and will be placed in service before January 1, 1991, or
Ã¢â‚¬Å“(iii) the project is undertaken by a Maine corporation and involves the modernization of pulp and paper mills in Millinocket and/or East Millinocket, Maine, or
Ã¢â‚¬Å“(iv) the project involves the installation of a paper machine for production of coated publication papers, the modernization of a pulp mill, and the installation of machinery and equipment with respect to related processes, as of December 31, 1985, in excess of $50,000,000 was incurred for the project, as of July 1986, in excess of $150,000,000 was incurred for the project, and the project is located in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, or
Ã¢â‚¬Å“(v) the project involves property of a type described in ADR classes 26.1, 26.2, 25, 00.3 and 00.4 included in a paper plant which will manufacture and distribute tissue, towel or napkin products; is located in Effingham County, Georgia; and is generally based upon a written General Description which was submitted to the Georgia Department of Revenue on or about June 13, 1985. </blockquote>

Glenn is alarmed on grounds of fiscal prudence--fair enough. I'm more concerned about what the legislative formulas, whatever form they may take, will do to our ability to follow the money. In other words, if the stimulus bill is going to have earmarks, let's have the list, including the sponsor, the amount of money committed, the name of the beneficiary and the justification for the project, and let's have that list online as soon as possible."		2009-02-05 16:45:44	2009-02-05 16:45:44	2009-02-05 16:45:44	1	0	1
597	Ethics Panel to Clear Rangel?	ethics-panel-to-clear-rangel	2	"House Ways and Means Chairman Charles B. Rangel predicted, on C-SPANÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Newsmakers program that aired Sunday, Feb. 1, 2009, that his <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2008/12/16/unraveling-rangel/"">multitude of ethics woes</a> would soon disappear. ""I think that next Tuesday you will see a break in this and as soon as the Ethics Committee organizes they ought to be able to dismiss this,"" National Journal's CongressDaily <a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/congressdaily/hbp_20090202_8780.php"">quoted</a> the Rangel as saying.

If so, it's hard to imagine that the Select Committee on Ethics will have devoted anything more than a cursory glance at the various issues raised. Consider just one aspect, for which documents are in the public record: Rangel's financial disclosure forms. We took a look at his filings going all the way back to 1978, the first year members were required to disclose information on their personal finances, and found 28 instances in which he failed to report acquiring, owning or disposing of assets. Assets worth between $239,026 and $831,000 appear or disappear with no disclosure of when they were acquired, how long they were held, or when they were sold, as the operative House rules at the time required.

In September 2008, Rangel announced he was hiring a forensic accountant to review 20 years of his financial records, including his financial disclosure forms and his tax returns. The Washington Post <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/15/AR2008091501419.html"">has a nice overview</a> of some of the issues raised.

In his calendar year 2006 filing, for example, Rangel reported 13 investments, mostly in mutual funds, which he valued in a range between $54,013 and $286,000, without indicating when he acquired them. In that same year, a quartet of assets that he reported acquiring in 2004 and worth between $95,004 and $250,000, disappeared from his filing without any indication of whether they were sold or exchanged. 

The count is based solely on what Rangel disclosed in his filings. It does not include obvious omissions--he failed to disclose his book deal with MacMillan, which published his memoir <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Havent-Had-Bad-Day-Since/dp/0312382138/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1233677897&sr=8-1"">And I Haven't Had a Bad Day Since</a> as an arrangement, nor did he disclose as income any advance or royalties he might have received from the book, which was published in April 2007. The count also does not include instances in which Rangel later corrected inaccurate filings, which he did on several occasions. For example, his original financial disclosure form for calendar year 1990, omitted what had been his principal asset through the 1980s and 1990s, an apartment building on W. 174th St. in New York. On May 15, 1991, the same day he filed the disclosure report, he advised the Ethics Committee in a letter accompanying his filing that the property produced a loss. On June 4, 1991, he sent the committee a second letter, stating that the building in fact had produced rental income between $15,001 and $50,000. 

Because we focused on omissions from the filings, we also didn't include as an error the Florida property Rangel disclosed selling twice (in 2006 and in 2007). Also, we looked only at the reporting of assets and not income--rents, interest and dividends--or trips, in which other inaccuracies have been reported.

We used disclosures from the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/candlook.php?CID=N00000964"">Center for Responsive Politics</a> from 1995 to the present, and from the Law Library of the Library of Congress.

Rangel's office did not respond to requests for clarification and additional information on the filings, saying that they would not comment while the ethics investigation was ongoing. Rangel pledged to release 20 years worth of tax returns when the probe is complete."		2009-02-04 16:13:48	2009-02-04 16:13:48	2009-02-04 16:13:48	1	0	1
6	My first two weeks...	6	3	"
<p class=""MsoNormal"">My first two weeks working on the real time project has involved sending out FOIA requests to as many as 80 federal agencies. We are asking for logs of correspondence between members of Congress and each agency. Most of them have been via e-mail or online forms and around 25 others via regular mail.<o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Since this is going to be a monthly feature, I was hoping that FOIA officers would send us the data at the end of every month, but that seems increasingly unlikely after a few conversations IÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ve had with FOIA officers at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Treasury. But just to make the process easier,  Bill and I are working on some ideas, from a simple mail merge to a more thorough automation process.<o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">IÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ve encountered a few hurdles: Some agencies want us to send FOIAs to all their departments while others want just one sent to headquarters. This could be a problem, just increasing the number of FOIAs we have to track.  Electronic FOIA is another problem:  some of the e-mails have been bouncing back or the online forms are not going through  like the one with the Department of Education.<o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">IÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ve received e-mails or letters from most of the agencies with the assigned FOIA tracking numbers with a few already asking for an extension. An e-mail from the Army says that they are processing other FOIAs from January so we should expect ours answered only after the 20-day period. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Considering this response, Bill and I are toying with the idea of sending in FOIA requests to them in advance, and then maybe weÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ll get responses in time. For instance, if we send out a request end of March asking for correspondences in June 2007, we may actually get them end of June. But thatÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s something IÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´m almost certain wonÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´t go down too well with FOIA officers. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p>And so the wait begins for the FOIAs to trickle in. <o:p></o:p></p>

In January 2006, Buckham <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/09/AR2006010901996.html"">told the Washington Post</a> that the firm was closing up shop in because ""reports in the press have made it difficult to continue as a lobbying/political entity.""

The second: <a href=""http://www.fara.gov/docs/5649-Exhibit-AB-20070228-9.pdf"">An agreement</a> between Levick Strategic Communications and Sheikhs Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum and Hamdan bin Rashid al Maktoum of Dubai relating to a lawsuit the latter two are involved in; Levick will provide . While the filing doesn't mention the specific lawsuit, I suspect it might have something to do with the legal action mentioned in <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5346430.stm"">this story</a>.

<strong>Update:</strong> Anu notices that on page 2 of the Levick agreement linked above (page 6 of 8 in the PDF), it says, ""We understand that you have retained Levick to assist in your capacity as outside counsel to the Executive Office with regard to the anticipated civil litigation concerning international human rights, labor and employment, and other related issues.""

Charles B. Rangel's spokesman, Emile Milne, on the Ways and Means chairman's book deal:

<blockquote>The Sunlight Foundation report also noted that Mr. Rangel did not list any royalties or advances he may have received from his book Ã¢â‚¬Å“And I HavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Had a Bad Day SinceÃ¢â‚¬Â (MacMillan 2007). Mr. Milne said Mr. Rangel received no proceeds.</blockquote>

The omission of the book deal was not included in <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/02/04/ethics-panel-to-clear-rangel/"">our count</a> of missing information from Rangel's disclosures. Proceeds are <a href=""http://www.investorwords.com/3870/proceeds.html"">money received through a sale or a loan</a>. As noted, the omission of the book deal was not included in our count of missing information from Rangel's disclosures. 

Also, was there an agreement with the publisher for whatever share of the proceeds the author would normally get to be donated to a charity? In whose name would it have been donated? Or, in lieu of royalties, did he get extra author's copies to distribute to friends and supporters? Did he write the book for free, or was there some other form of compensation? Of course, it's also possible that the book didn't sell well enough to generate royalty payments, though it did manage to eke out a spot at the bottom of the New York Times' hard cover poli-book best seller list (which, I hasten to add, is not the same thing as the New York Times Best Seller list) <a href=""http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/04/28/aprils-poli-book-best-seller-list/"">two</a> months <a href=""http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/26/mays-poli-book-best-seller-list/"">running</a> after its release and was reissued in paperback (usually a sign of some sales)."		2009-02-05 15:26:55	2009-02-05 15:26:55	2009-02-05 15:26:55	1	0	1

610	Genealogy of the Stimulus Bill	genealogy-of-the-stimulus-bill	2	"The current economic crisis does seem to present a combination of circumstances (the housing crisis, a credit crisis, declining international trade, rising unemployment), some of which are causes, some of which are symptoms, none of which--of course--are particularly pleasant for those going through them. So how does Congress, legislatively, address new circumstances? Do members and their staffs (and the lobbyists whispering in their ears) craft bills to solve the problems at hand? Or do they go through their archives and relabel old bills as solutions to new problems?  

Using the indispensable <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us"">Govtrack.us</a>, I'm going to look for antecedents of passages in the House version of the <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1"">stimuls bill</a>, using the <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1"">full text</a> of the bill, then searching <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billsearch.xpd"">prior Congresses</a> for similar language. 

For example, Sec. 1261 of the bill which ""may be cited as the 'Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2009,'"" is actually the <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h110-985"">Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2007</a>, which was introduced by Rep. Henry Waxman on March 15, 2007, long before the collapse of Bear Stearns, AIG, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. In approaching the stimulus bill, did Congress craft new provisions to meet new circumstances? If not, can we trace the sponsors of the old ideas pressed into service to meet new circumstances? (Full disclosure in the nature of a statement against our interests: Sunlight is <a href=""http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/01/23/dear-inspector-general-barofsky/"">on the record</a> supporting strong whistleblower protections in the stimulus, and elsewhere.)

Section 9301 of the House Bill, the ""21st Century Green High-Performing Public School Facilities,"" was introduced by Rep.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Half a dozen firms that Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., has sponsored earmarks for in the current defense appropriations bill hired PMA Group, the Washington based defense lobbying firm in 2008. Last night <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=6840438&amp;page=1"">ABC news reported</a> that the FBI raided PMA Group offices in November.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Earlier this year federal investigators raided another company with ties to Murtha, Kuchera Industries, a company that has never hired PMA Group but has received several earmarks from Murtha in the past years. In the 2008 election cycle KucheraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s employees have given $11,500 to MurthaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s campaign. <span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;""><span> </span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In March 2008, Murtha submitted <a href=""http://appropriations.house.gov/pdf/FY2009DefenseCertifications2of2.pdf "">these letters</a> requesting funding for 26 different projects in his home state and for other defense contractors based outside Pennsylavania including two projects to be awarded to Kuchera. The exact amounts directed to the companies do not have to be disclosed in these letters.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">MTS Technologies is another company based in Johnstown, Pa., MurthaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home district, that has hired PMA Group to lobby on defense appropriations and the company's employees have given as much as $23,000 in the last election cycle. MTS has two earmark requests to their name sponsored by Murtha. According to <a href=""http://www.taxpayer.net/resources.php?category=&amp;type=Project&amp;proj_id=1881&amp;action=Headlines%20By%20TCS"">Taxpayers for Common Sense</a>, PMA GroupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clients have secured earmarks worth a total of $299 million. In 2008 lobbyists for the PMA Group have given $15,930 to Murtha, and most of these donations were made in the last four days of October, according to lobbyists' campaign donation records filed with the House Clerks Office.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">17 of the 26 companies slated to get earmarks sponsored by Murtha have made a total of $150,000 in campaign contributions to the CongressmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s campaign in the last election cycle. Of these 26 companies the largest donation comes from employees of Argon ST, a defense contractor based in Fairfax,  Va. They have given over $30,000 to MurthaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s campaign in the last two years, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. In the past too,<a href=""http://earmarkwatch.org/earmark/41608/)""> the company has received earmarks </a>from Murtha and have hired the PMA Group to lobby on their behalf.</p>

I remember telling a reporter, around the time the TARP program was unveiled, that it shouldn't be too hard to track the performance of publicly traded companies, and that Treasury should post the information online.

627	PMA Investigation: Looking for More than Straw Men?	pma-investigation-looking-for-more-than-straw-men	2	"Congressional Quarterly looks <a href=""http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?parm1=1&docID=news-000003055541&mp=Most_Emailed"">in breadth and depth</a> at the influence of the PMA Group, whose offices were raided by the FBI. (The story is co-written by my old colleague Alex Knott, who started delving into PMA <a href=""http://projects.publicintegrity.org/pns/report.aspx?aid=388"">back in 2004</a>.) As good a story as it is ... here's an excerpt clipped from <a href=""http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/70354/"">InstaPundit</a> ... 

<blockquote>    More than 100 House members secured earmarks in a major spending bill for clients of a single lobbying firm Ã¢â‚¬â€ The PMA Group Ã¢â‚¬â€ known for its close ties to John P. Murtha , the congressman in charge of Pentagon appropriations.

    Ã¢â‚¬Å“It shows you how good they were,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Keith Ashdown, chief investigator at the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The sheer coordination of that would take an army to finish.Ã¢â‚¬Â

    PMAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offices have been raided, and the firm closed its political action committee last week amid reports that the FBI is investigating possibly illegal campaign contributions to Murtha and other lawmakers. . . . In the spending bill managed by Murtha, the fiscal 2008 Defense appropriation, 104 House members got earmarks for projects sought by PMA clients, according to Congressional QuarterlyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s analysis of a database constructed by AshdownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s group.

    Those House members, plus a handful of senators, combined to route nearly $300 million in public money to clients of PMA through that one law (PL 110-116).

    And when the lawmakers were in need Ã¢â‚¬â€ as they all are to finance their campaigns Ã¢â‚¬â€ PMA came through for them.</blockquote>

...here comes the big but: it's doubtful that any of that activity will ever land any of those lawmakers in hot water. 

PMA Group appears to be in trouble not because of earmarks or for fluffing up the campaign accounts of members of Congress with legitimate donations (they've been a <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/usearch/searchresults_detailed.php?srch_term=PMA%20Group&type=O&cnt=40&filter=tm"">top fluffer</a> for a remarkable number of members), but rather for what appear to be <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/13/AR2009021302746.html?hpid=topnews"">illegal donations</a> made through a straw donor. And while it's illegal for, say, me to reimburse you for a campaign contribution, lawmakers have taken such contributions and not gotten in any trouble at all. (See <a href=""http://www.indianexpress.com/oldstory.php?storyid=41457"">Majumder, Bob</a>, for an example that also involves John Murtha.)

Quid pro quos are illegal, but there are <a href=""http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm02046.htm"">serious hurdles</a> to using campaign contributions in any quid pro quo investigation:

<blockquote><b>Campaign Contributions</b>

A bribery charge can be premised on a campaign contribution. But be careful. It is problematical that a gratuity charge under 201(c) can rest on a bona fide campaign contribution, unless the contribution was a ruse that masqueraded for a gift to the personal benefit of the public officer as was the case in Brewster, supra. This is because campaign contributions represent a necessary feature of the American political process, they normally inure to the benefit of a campaign committee rather than directly to the personal benefit of a public officer, and they are almost always given and received with a generalized expectation of currying favor with the candidate benefitting therefrom. For these reasons, recent Federal jurisprudence on the subject suggests substantial judicial reluctance to extend the Federal crime of gratuities under section 201(c) to bona fide campaign donations.

PRACTICE TIP: Where the transaction represents a bona fide campaign contribution, prosecutors must normally be prepared to prove that it involved a quid pro quo understanding and thereby constituted a ""bribe"" offense actionable under section 201(b).

COMMENT: This same distinction between bribes, gratuities and lawful campaign contributions has recently been applied to some of the Federal prosecutive theories that are currently used to address bribery and corruption by state and local public officials. For example, in McCormick v. United States, 500 U.S. 257 (1991) the Supreme Court held that the Hobbs Act (18 U.S.C. Ã‚Â§ 1951) did not apply to a series of campaign contributions that were made with a general intent to curry favor with a state senator and to thank him for his support. Noting that campaign contributions are a necessary part of the American political process, the Court held that when an allegedly corrupt payment represents a bona fide campaign contribution, the prosecution must prove the existence of a quid pro quo. This principle was thereafter affirmed shortly thereafter in Evans v. United States, 504 U.S. 255 (1992).</blockquote>

This reminds me of what Rep. Tim Holden said <a href=""http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/presscenter/articles/2008/06/08/earmarked-profits/"">when asked</a> about getting earmarks for a PMA Group client (PMA Group is a big Holden contributor):

<blockquote>''Who is going to contribute to your campaign, people you don't help?'' Holden said, before adding: ''There is no quid pro quo here.''</blockquote>

It will be interesting to see where the PMA probe goes, but I'd be surprised if any of the hundred lawmakers running into trouble for earmarking funds for clients of a big campaign contributor."		2009-02-19 20:07:31	2009-02-19 20:07:31	2009-02-19 20:07:31	1	0	1
63	Thompson's FARA Filings Are Not Online	thompsons-fara-filings-are-not-online	2	"Two of the shortcomings I mentioned about the <a href=""http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fara/links/search.html"">new database</a> that the Justice Department's <a href=""http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fara/"">Foreign Agent Registration Unit</a> recently put online are that not every form is available (especially the <a href=""http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fara/forms/OMB_1105_0013.pdf"">Short Forms</a> that individual foreign agents must file), and that you can't link to search results.

Both would be useful in providing the information that Nicole Belle <a href=""http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/05/31/foreign-lobbying-database-up-and-running"">asks for</a> at the <a href=""http://www.crooksandliars.com"">Crooks and Liars</a> site -- what exactly did former Tennessee senator and possible presidential candidate Fred Thompson do when he was a lobbyist for Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin &amp; Kahn in the early 1990s (from Oct. 10, 1991 to Sept. 17, 1993, according to the unlinkable search result from the FARA database). A quick perusal of the firm's supplementals show that, on Dec. 11, 1991, Thompson called John Sununu, then chief to staff to President George H.W. Bush, about the Haiti embargo. The firm's client was Jean Bertrand Aristide, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Bertrand_Aristide#First_presidency_and_coup"">who'd been deposed</a> a few months before. See page 30 of <a href=""http://www.fara.gov/docs/2661-Supplemental-Statement-19920201-D0566304.pdf"">this form</a> for the info on Thompson.

631	Lobbying for a Piece of the Bailout and Stimulus Action?	631-revision	2	"First a word of caution: when the title of a <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/projects/tarp.html"">database</a> ends with a question mark (in this case, <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/projects/tarp.html"">A Piece of the Action?</a>, approach it with some caution. 

I've tried to put together a tool for tracking the lobbying surrounding the <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-1424"">Emergency Economic Stabilization Act</a>, the <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h1/show"">American Recovery & Reinvestment Act</a>, and whatever other bailouts and stimuli Congress enacts (TARP II? Son of Stimulus?) over the next few months. Using very imperfect records from two online congressional disclosure systems that track the same information in different ways (the classic <a href=""http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/apr05/2701"">square filters, round holes</a> government problem), I've pieced together <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/projects/tarp.html"">what we know</a>, which is better, after all, than knowing nothing. 

<a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/projects/tarp.html"">A Piece of the Action?</a> pulls together lobbying forms gleaned from the search engines of both the <a href=""http://disclosures.house.gov/ld/ldsearch.aspx"">House Clerk's Office</a> and the <a href=""http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=selectfields"">Senate Office of Public Records</a>. The House filings cover the fourth quarter of 2008, and were accumulated by searching for terms including TARP, Emergency Economic Stabilization and Troubled Asset Relief Program. I would have liked to have included a search for ""Economic Stimulus,"" but the 110th Congress passed an <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-5140"">Economic Stimulus Act of 2008</a> early in 2008, and lobbyists were still listing it as an interest in the fourth quarter of 2008. The Senate records are all from 2009 -- they include mostly registrations (when a lobbying firm gets a new client) and a few first quarter terminations (when a client decides to stop using a lobbying firm).

The records come from two sources because the House and Senate approach lobbying disclosure in very different ways. Substantively, the House records are much better -- I was able to pull down all the language lobbying firms listed as specific areas of interest (and easily verify that my search terms were indeed turning up) -- plus use the document ID to construct a URL that links back to the original filing. Sadly, the House doesn't update its site nearly as frequently as the Senate does, so to get anything from 2009, I had to pull down records from the Senate. When the House starts putting first quarter registrations online, I'll probably try to sub out the Senate data for the superior House data. Ditto with first quarter reports, when they become available. 

I used DabbleDB to build the database, and added some features that allow for distributed research -- more on that in a minute."		2009-02-23 16:46:11	2009-02-23 16:46:11	2009-02-23 16:46:11	1	0	1
633	Who's seeking A Piece of the Action?	whos-seeking-a-piece-of-the-action	2	"The bailout (the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, TARP, etc.) and the stimulus (the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act) are massive pieces of legislation with lots of moving parts. Thus, the more eyeballs on them and what's around them, the better. 

<a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/projects/tarp.html"">A Piece of the Action?</a> tracks one aspect of the unfolding age of bailing and stimulating -- interests hiring Washington lobbyists to at the very least monitor and likely to try to influence how the government spends its money.

As noted <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/02/23/lobbying-for-a-piece-of-the-bailout-and-stimulus-action/"">immediately below</a>, this database is an imperfect resource. But it's what we can do with our inadequate disclosure regimen, and you can help make it better.

Click on any line item in the database, scroll down to the bottom of the screen, and see if you can help track down information on the client -- its headquarters location, a brief description, a link to information on its lobbying interests -- to make this resource more useful. 

Take a look at <a href=""https://distributedrealtime.dabbledb.com/page/apieceoftheaction/JAZuZNkU?keyword=san+mateo+county&entry=83080&digest=637714307275754138455471552238888653046641773837#editEntry"">this entry</a>, culled from the database -- it lists San Mateo County as the client. The <a href=""http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=0c48e48e-8cdf-4ff8-93f1-1078008171d0"">actual form filed at the Senate</a> tells us that San Mateo County is in California, its headquarters is in Redmond, CA, zip code 94063 -- adding that information helps to make this resource more useful (I'll start posting a map if we start getting a lot of location information). You can also find that the county lists, among its lobbying interests, TARP. It's <a href=""http://www.co.sanmateo.ca.us/bos.dir/BosAgendas/agendas2008/Agenda20081028/20081028_rpt_13.pdf"">no secret</a> why the county government is interested--a link that would be well worth adding to the database in the ""What do they want?"" field.

I'll keep updating the database a few times a week with new filings.

These filings represent new hirings, and do not account for the hundreds of other interests whose regular Washington lobbyists have added the bailout and stimulus to their specific lobbying interests. Also, because of the vagaries of the searching the Senate Office of Public Records database and the requirements of lobbying disclosure forms, other interests might have hired new firms who added one or both bills to their lobbying issues, but won't disclose such activity publicly until the end of the first quarter of 2009.

They hired <a href=""http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=ef0ee046-58dc-4d5d-879d-77c3c85dac63"">Winston & Strawn</a> to lobby for the ""inclusion of tax incentives for the home furnishing industry in the Economic Stimulus Package."" Just an aside -- there's a lot of material on the Web about the AHFA's attempt, including <a href=""http://www.sleepproducts.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Advocacy_Issues/Legislative_Action_Center/Economic_Stimulus_Analysis_PowerPoint.pdf"">PowerPoint presentations</a>, <a href=""http://www.ahfa.us/news/viewArticleDetail.asp?ID=462"">press releases</a> and even a <a href=""http://www.docstoc.com/docs/4054193/AMERICAN-HOME-FURNISHINGS-AND-BUILDING-PRODUCTS-COALITION-KEY-CONGRESSIONAL-MEMBERS"">list of key congressional contacts</a>. 

The government of Forsyth County in North Carolina <a href=""http://www.co.forsyth.nc.us/commissioners/AgendaArchive/01_12_09_Summary.pdf"">hired</a> the <a href=""http://www.fergusongroup.us/"">Ferguson Group</a>, which ""wrote the book on lobbying for local governments,"" its Web site notes (it's a quote from <i>The Hill</i>) to lobby on multiple issues, <a href=""http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=b2fc43cc-ba65-4891-b643-938d49ddb234"">including</a> economic stimulus funding. Maybe I'm the only one who finds this kind of stuff interesting, but this <a href=""http://www.co.forsyth.nc.us/Budget/pre_budget0506/Comm_EcDev06.pdf"">FY 2006 budget document</a> suggests that this isn't the first time the County has directed taxpayer money to the Ferguson Group:

<blockquote> Funds are provided for various agencies that promote economic development throughout the County and the region, including the Winston-Salem Chamber of Commerce, Kernersville Chamber of Commerce, Downtown Winston-Salem Association, Winston-Salem Business, Inc., !dealliance, and Piedmont Triad Partnership. The funding for the Winston-Salem Chamber of Commerce includes $22,000 for the Ferguson Group.</blockquote>

The Ferguson Group's advocacy on behalf of localities seeking a piece of the stimulus action has already <a href=""http://www.mcclatchydc.com/200/story/61924.html"">been covered</a> by Lisa Zagaroli of McClatchey:

<blockquote>Forsyth County, N.C., signed on last month with the same lobbying firm, The Ferguson Group, which represents Concord, Fayetteville, High Point and now Matthews, among many others.

A partner in the lobbying firm, Jennifer Imo, said that because the stimulus bill doesn't have specific earmarks, one of the ways she helps communities is by informing them which programs will require competitive grant applications, which will require applications to state administering agencies, and which have ""use it or lose it"" deadlines.

""How are they to know all of that unless they are following it as closely as we are?"" she said. ""We are basically their staff in Washington that's monitoring very closely the stimulus process and making sure that they can take advantage of all the opportunities that will be afforded to communities like Matthews in the final package.""

Myers said he and the town manager will be traveling to Washington on Wednesday to tell lawmakers why Matthews deserves federal money.

The town's wish list for the stimulus bill includes $750,000 for intersection improvements at NC 51 at Fullwood Drive and another $250,000 for the intersection at Monroe Road; $525,000 for work on North Trade Street; and $500,000 for Buckley Way Street.</blockquote>

One of the questions I always had about earmarks, which now I suppose I also have to have about stimulus spending, is whether there's an ""influence excise"" attached to getting the money. How many lobbyists will be ""monitoring very closely the stimulus process and making sure that they can take advantage of all the opportunities that will be afforded to communities""?"		2009-02-24 21:49:48	2009-02-24 21:49:48	2009-02-24 21:49:48	1	0	1

65	Whistleblower Complaints to DoD	whistleblower-complaints-to-dod	3	"Two letters members of Congress wrote to the <a href=""http://www.dcaa.mil/"">Defense Contract Audit Agency</a> reveal two cases of employees of government contractors who alleged wrongdoing by their companies.

We learned about the letters from our Freedom of Information request to the agency for congressional correspondence logs. We have received DCAA's responses to both members of Congress, but not the original letters to which DCAA was responding. When we receive those, we'll post them, highlighting any relevant information from them.

Here's what we do know:

On Jan. 5, 2007, Senator Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., wrote to DCAA, which does all contract audits for the Department of Defense, concerning a letter her office had received from a whistleblower working for <a href=""http://www.advatechpacific.com/"">Advatech Pacific, Inc.</a>, a Redlands, Calif.-based space engineering company. The whistleblower claimed that the company was overcharging the government.

According to <a href=""http://fedspending.org/"">Fedspending.org</a>, Advatech has received contracts worth more than $20 million from the Department of Defense since 2000. A large portion of the contracts given to Advatech are non-competitive; almost all the contracts the firm received in 2005 and 2006 appear to be no-bid contracts.

Advatech also was the beneficiary of <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/earmarks/query.html?col=earmarks&amp;qt=advatech"">congressional earmarks </a>amounting to more than $10 million in 2005, according to the recently released OMB earmarks database. (Note: We're still looking into why, but the OMB numbers for 2005 are higher than the amount of contract dollars listed in Fedspending.org's database; one would expect the total dollar amount of contracts awarded by federal agencies to be higher than the amount.)

Last year, TPM Muckraker published a story noting connections between Advatech and a relative of Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., who chaired the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee from 1999 to 2005, and now serves as the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee. <a href=""http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/000838.php"">TPM Muckraker</a> reported that Advatech executives were contributing to a political action committee that was led by LewisÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ step-daughter; the report also noted that the company's earmarks came from the subcommittee Lewis chaired.

As to the whistleblower's complaint about Advatech, calls to the Department of Defense Inspector GeneralÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s office and calls and emails to the DCAA elicited this refrain: Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºThis is an open investigation and we cannot talk about it.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ Advatech Pacific has not returned our phone calls.

The second letter is a response to an initial inquiry from Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., about a constituent who claims to have been fired from his job a week after he reported an Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºillegal procedureÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ related to a federal contract to both his company, <a href=""http://www.belcan.com/"">Belcan Corporation</a>, and the DCAA. In the reply, the DCAA wrote, Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºBelcan Corporation has not been awarded any defense contracts subject to the DCAA auditÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¶Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ The complaint was made in 2005 and referred to the DOD Inspector General. (I am still following up with both the IGÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s office and the DCAA on the status of this complaint.)

Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºBelcan Corporation takes allegations of impropriety very seriously as reflected by our commitment to integrity.  All matters of potential impropriety are immediately investigated and addressed,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ said Mike Wirth, Chief Financial Officer, Belcan Corporation.

Recent provisions in the <a href=""http://pogoblog.typepad.com/dod_contractor_final.pdf"">2008 Defense authorization bill</a>, introduced by Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., extend whistleblower protection to employees of defense contractors -- whether or not the Belcan employee would have qualified, it's clear that with so many taxpayer dollars going to private companies, those who report potential waste, fraud or abuse deserve legal protection."		2007-06-04 18:17:45	2007-06-04 18:17:45	2007-06-04 18:17:45	1	0	1

661	Senate approves earmarks for PMA Group clients	senate-approves-earmarks-for-pma-group-clients	2	"Sen. Tom Coburn would like to do away with all earmarks; this evening the Senate voted on an amendment he proposed that would eliminate, from the <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h1105/show"">Omnibus Appropriations bill</a>, earmarks for 14 clients of the <a href=""http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=news-000003055876"">soon-to-be-defunct</a> lobbying shop, the <a href=""http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/pmapolitics-may-infect-2010-races-2009-03-04.html"">PMA Group</a>. The purpose of the <a href=""http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00080"">amendment</a> read as follows:

<blockquote> To prohibit taxpayer dollars from being earmarked to 14 clients of a lobbying firm under Federal investigation for making campaign donations in exchange for political favors for the group's clients. </blockquote>

Like <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/02/25/house-kills-effort-investigate-lobbyist-lawmaker-ties/"">previous measures</a> aimed at PMA Group, this one failed, 52-43. In essence, the House is on record as finding nothing about PMA Group's activities that merits curiosity, while the Senate says just write the checks already.  

<b>Update</b>: Instapundit has <a href=""http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/72062/"">much more</a> on the ""The Best Congress Money Can Buy."" In fairness to Congress, it's only a fraction -- a mere <a href=""http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=news-000003055541"">100 House members</a> who've done PMA Group's bidding. Give PMA Group some credit too -- they weren't indiscriminate consumers; they and their clients <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/03/congressmen-overseeing-defense.html"">concentrated their largesse</a> on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. 

I've told a few people that while the PMA Group scandal is different from Abramoff, in many ways it's more serious. Abramoff was a sort of Bernard Madoff character, unique in his personal excesses, corrosively corrupting, but still just one guy. PMA Group is a methodical business predicated on the notion that for a few hundred thousands of dollars of campaign contributions, it could rake in millions in lobbying fees while its clients got hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks and billions more in federal contracts. Abramoff's excesses were fairly unique; PMA Group's business model is standard operating procedure in Washington."		2009-03-05 05:05:33	2009-03-05 05:05:33	2009-03-05 05:05:33	1	0	1

That is a peculiar condition of society which enables a whole nation to instantly recognize point and meaning in the familiar newspaper anecdote, which puts into the mouth of a distinguished speculator in lands and mines this remark:--""I wasn't worth a cent two years ago, and now I owe two millions of dollars.""</blockquote>

I can't tell for sure from the memo, but it looks like Office of Management and Budget intends to track them in both House and Senate bills as they're reported out of committee, as they're voted on, and in conference reports as soon as they come out:

<blockquote>Agencies should report to OMB the number and dollar value of earmarks in each account within seven days after an appropriations bill is reported by the House or Senate Appropriations committee or passes the House or Senate Floor. In addition, agencies should provide a PDF of the relevant language for each earmark, or a PDF of a spreadsheet listing each earmark in lieu of the relevant language, which may be made available to the public. For Conference committee reports, which are often considered quickly, agencies should expedite their analysis and provide it as soon as possible, but also within no more than seven days.

Kevin Bogardus <a href=""http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/omb-to-keep-track-of-fiscal-2008-earmarks-2007-05-31.html"">had more</a> on this in The Hill on Thursday, and, via <a href=""http://www.memeorandum.com/070601/p75#a070601p75"">Memeorandum</a>, I see that Brian Faughanan on the Weekly Standard blog <a href=""http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2007/06/tracking_earmarks_is_nice_but_1.asp"">raises questions</a> about ""phonemarks"" -- earmarks that do not appear in appropriations bills or conference reports. Instead, lawmakers phone or email or otherwise contact federal agencies and [understatement] pleasantly request [/end understatement] funding for their pet projects. The Washington Post's John Solomon and Jeffrey H. Birnbaum took an <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/23/AR2007052301782.html"">in-depth look</a> at the practice last week. 

OMB issued a <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2007/m07-10.pdf"">memorandum</a> on February 15, 2007, aimed at the practice (it seems to ban it). In early April (I think--I can't check the date remotely), Anu and I took part in a conference call with some OMB officials that was arranged by some folks at the Heritage Foundation I asked whether OMB's earmark reporting would catch phone marks -- they referred to the Feb. 15 instructions and also seemed fairly confident that agencies would either follow those instructions and not honor phonemarks, or report them along with the other earmarks. I'll call OMB Monday and see what they have to say.

<b>Update:</b> The Associated Press <a href=""http://apnews.myway.com/article/20070603/D8PHA8LG0.html"">is reporting</a> that House Democrats are going to keep their earmarks up their sleeves until the last possible minute (which would seemingly render the above effort by OMB moot):

<blockquote>Democrats are sidestepping rules approved their first day in power in January to clearly identify ""earmarks"" - lawmakers' requests for specific projects and contracts for their states.

Rather than including specific pet projects, grants and contracts in legislation as it is being written, Democrats are following an order by the House Appropriations Committee chairman to keep the bills free of such earmarks until it is too late for critics to effectively challenge them.

Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., says those requests for dams, community grants and research contracts for favored universities or hospitals will be added to spending measures in the fall. That is when House and Senate negotiators assemble final bills.

Such requests total billions of dollars.

As a result, most lawmakers will not get a chance to oppose specific projects as wasteful or questionable when the spending bills for various agencies get their first votes in the full House in June.</blockquote>

Chris Dodd's real estate deals. The Senate Ethics Committee is already looking at his <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/Christopher_Dodd#Countrywide_mortgage_scandal"">mortgage</a> with Countrywide Financial (more details <a href=""http://blogs.courant.com/on_background/2009/02/dodd-releases-countrywide-mort.html"">here</a>); Rennie writes that other Dodd properties might be worth looking into:

<blockquote>It was reported <a href=""http://www.courant.com/news/opinion/op_ed/hc-rennie0222.artfeb22,0,4471645.column"">here</a> two weeks ago that Downe's real estate development partner, William ""Bucky"" Kessinger of Kansas City, Mo., purchased a 1,700-square-foot home in Ireland with Dodd in 1994 for $160,000. Downe's name appeared on the transfer document filed in the Irish Land Registry as the witness to Kessinger's signature. Kessinger owned two-thirds of the property, Dodd one-third.

Dodd's spokesman told The Courant in 2001 that the senator and Downe, who pleaded guilty to insider trading in 1993, had been friends for many years. No one mentioned that Dodd and Downe together purchased a condominium in Washington, D.C., in 1986. Dodd bought Downe's share 3 1/2 years later.

When Dodd owned a condominium with Downe in the 1980s, while Downe was carrying on his illegal stock scheme, no details of their arrangement were in the deed or mortgage filings.Who paid which expenses associated with owning the condominium didn't fall into the public's view. Neither did who used the condominium.

It raises the prospect that a senator, working much of the time in Washington, could have had his living expenses subsidized when the senator owned that real estate with a rich New York socialite. Even members of the smart set can be in only one place at a time. Downe already had homes in some of the nation's finest neighborhoods when he bought the D.C. condominium with Dodd, who used to be called, but no more, one of the poorest members of the Senate.

Dodd was never required to name Kessinger (on Senate disclosures) as the co-owner of their house on 10 acres of waterfront property on the west coast of Ireland for the eight years they owned it together. As with the condominium, the public doesn't know who paid the expenses associated with it when Kessinger owned two-thirds of it.</blockquote>

Here's an image of what Dodd disclosed about his cottage in his calendar year 2000 financial disclosure form (filed in 2001):

<a href=""http://pfds.opensecrets.org/N00000581_00.pdf""><img alt="""" src=""http://media.sunlightprojects.org/realtime/images/wp/Dodddisclosure.jpg"" title=""Dodd disclosure"" class=""alignnone"" width=""503"" height=""102"" /></a>

Note that Dodd doesn't disclose the owners of the other 2/3s of his Irish ""cottage"" -- nor is he required to. Shouldn't we know who politicians are buying properties with? Given the number of members who've run into ethical questions regarding homes and vacation homes (Sen. Ted Stevens, Rep. Charlie Rangel and Rep. Alan Mollohan spring immediately to mind) shouldn't we have more disclosure about member's real property?

<b>Bonus Update:</b> As I was trying to upload the image from Dodd's PDF to this file, I had a chat with Kevin Rennie, the intrepid investigator who has unearthed the information on Dodd. He told me he got interested in this from looking at the disclosure -- ""I wondered, who owns the other two-thirds?"" he said. He also sends along this picture of the cottage (click for a larger image):

<blockquote>Former Senate aide Ann Copland pleaded guilty in federal court Tuesday to one count of conspiracy to commit fraud, acknowledging she accepted more than $25,000 in gifts including tickets to sporting events and concerts from disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his associates. 

Copland, a longtime aide to Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) who left in 2008 to join Mississippi Public Broadcasting, has agreed to cooperate with Justice Department attorneys in their long-running investigation into lobbying activities on Capitol Hill. Copland is among the 18 individuals, including the incarcerated Abramoff, to be charged with wrongdoing in the case since 2005. 

Appearing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, CoplandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice wavered at times during the hourlong hearing, in which she admitted to exchanging official activities Ã¢â‚¬â€ including designating appropriations earmarks Ã¢â‚¬â€ for tickets to events including baseball and football games, ice skating competitions and concerts such as Green Day, Ã¢â‚¬â„¢N Sync and Paul McCartney. Many of those events included tickets in private suites. </blockquote>

It's worth noting that under our system, <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/02/19/pma-investigation-looking-for-more-than-straw-men/"">$25,000 or $250,000 or even $2.5 million in campaign contributions</a> are treated much differently than $25,000 in concert tickets. From the DoJ <a href=""http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm02046.htm"">criminal resource manual</a>:

A bribery charge can be premised on a campaign contribution. But be careful. It is problematical that a gratuity charge under 201(c) can rest on a bona fide campaign contribution, unless the contribution was a ruse that masqueraded for a gift to the personal benefit of the public officer as was the case in Brewster, supra. This is because campaign contributions represent a necessary feature of the American political process, they normally inure to the benefit of a campaign committee rather than directly to the personal benefit of a public officer, <b>and they are almost always given and received with a generalized expectation of currying favor with the candidate benefitting therefrom.</b> For these reasons, recent Federal jurisprudence on the subject suggests substantial judicial reluctance to extend the Federal crime of gratuities under section 201(c) to bona fide campaign donations.</blockquote>

Maxine Waters helped arrange a meeting between Treasury officials and the CEO of a bank that her husband may or may not have owned $250,000 worth of stock in:

<blockquote>Top banking regulators were taken aback late last year when a California congresswoman helped set up a meeting in which the chief executive of a bank with financial ties to her family asked them for up to $50 million in special bailout funds, Treasury officials said.

Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, requested the September meeting on behalf of executives at OneUnited, one of the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest black-owned banks. Ms. WaterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s husband, Sidney Williams, had served on the bankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s board of directors until early last year and has owned at least $250,000 in stock in the institution. Treasury officials said the session with nearly a dozen senior banking regulators had been intended to allow minority-owned banks and their trade association to discuss the losses they had incurred from the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But Kevin Cohee, OneUnitedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chief executive, instead seized the opportunity to plead for special assistance for his bank, federal officials said.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Here you had a tiny community bank that comes in and they are not proposing a broader policy Ã¢â‚¬â€ they were asking for help for themselves,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Steve Lineberry, a former Treasury aide who attended the meeting. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember that ever happening before.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ms. Waters declined on Tuesday to comment on the meeting, or to say if her husband still owns OneUnited shares. </blockquote>

We won't find out whether he owned the shares at the time because members won't release their 2008 personal financial disclosure forms until June 14, 2009.

<blockquote>No matter how we slice and dice the data related to contributions from embattled lobbying firm PMA Group and its clients, Rep. John Murtha (D-Penn.), chair of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, remains at or near the top of the recipient list, along with Reps. Pete Visclosky (D-Ind.) and Jim Moran (D-Va.). This week, though, we took yet another look at the contributions from the firm that specializes in securing federal earmarks for its clients, this time analyzing all donations from the firm and its clients back in time to all members of the 111th Congress, plus President Obama....

Since 1998, the firm and its clients have given $40.4 million total to the candidate committees and leadership PACs of 516 lawmakers--nearly every member of the current Congress--with Democrats collecting 58 percent of that. President Obama is high on the list, having collected $905,700 from the firm and its clients, ranking him fourth among all recipients after Murtha, Visclosky and Moran. One caveat about Obama's total: Because presidential contenders raise so much more money than congressional candidates, they tend to rank highly on lists like this one. PMA represented some very large companies, whose employees supported Obama, but the lobbying firm's own people gave him a total of $4,225 in the 2004 and 2008 cycles.</blockquote>

OpenSecrets.org also has a downloadable spreadsheet of contributions -- available in the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/03/pma-group-and-clients-paid-out.html"">post</a>.

<blockquote>John Moore, an Irish business partner of DowneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, also lobbied Galway county council to approve a planning application by Dodd to extend and renovate the property soon after it was bought in 1994.

Moore said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t write to the council on behalf of Edward Downe. I was involved with Galway Chamber of Commerce at the time and had got to know Senator Dodd. I asked the council to look favourably on his planning application because I thought he might be able to help attract US businesses to Galway. Ã¢â‚¬Â</blockquote>

Who paid for the renovations? How much did they cost? Did Dodd and his partner who bought two-thirds of the ""cottage,"" William ""Bucky"" Kessinger, split them? Oddly, the renovation costs aren't mentioned in the <a href=""http://www.courant.com/news/politics/hc-doddproperty.artmar15,0,4867366.story"">lengthy examination</a> of the Irish deal that ran in the Hartford Courant.

In that same <i>Courant</i> article, Dodd says of his partner in the purchase:

<blockquote>The purchase price for the three-bedroom cottage was $160,000, records show. Dodd said that he contributed $12,000 toward the down payment and that he owned one-third of the cottage, while Kessinger owned two-thirds. Dodd said he brought Kessinger on board in part because, financially, ""it would have been tight"" to purchase it solo. But he said he did not remember why he and Kessinger did not split the purchase fifty-fifty.

Dodd said Kessinger had visited Ireland several times and had long believed that owning property in the country would be a good investment. ""We thought that we would use it occasionally, let family and friends use it and then rent it out,"" Dodd said.</blockquote>

Did Kessinger use the cottage occasionally, or let his family and friends use it?

Kind of amazing that one senator's floor speech can have the force of law. And <a href=""http://earmarks.omb.gov/resources/citations/citation_85.pdf"">here's another exmaple</a> of earmarks made, not by statute or conference report but rather by a May 17th, 2005, letter that redirects some HHS funding for fiscal year 2005 (the link takes you to a PDF).

As to the news that Rep. David Obey and House Democrats <a href=""http://apnews.myway.com/article/20070603/D8PHA8LG0.html"">intend to sidestep their own rules</a> by not disclosing earmarks until the last minute (that is, after the House and Senate conferees have agreed to a final version of the bill), Baker says, ""ItÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s a very short time frame from when the conference report is filed and then voted on so it definitely makes our jobs a lot harder in terms of tracking the earmarks.""

It's been a while since I've looked at tariffs, but, as <a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/congressdaily/cda_20090313_2786.php"">CongressDaily</a> notes, they're back in the news (well, at least inside the beltway): 

<blockquote>fter a high-profile fight over earmarks in the omnibus appropriations bill, another front in that battle is shaping up to be a huge package of tariff breaks on imported goods being cobbled together by the House Ways and Means Committee.

Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley wants to add the name of each lobbyist or individual proponent to the hundreds of individual tariff and duty suspensions Congress might consider, often of benefit to a single company. ""Since President Obama says he opposes earmarks and wants more transparency surrounding them, he and his congressional allies should support full transparency, including lobbyist disclosure, in the miscellaneous tariff bill process,"" an aide explained.

The measure ran out of gas last year when the Finance Committee expressed little interest in moving forward. There is an added urgency now, however, as many of the 817 tariff bills introduced in the 110th Congress in the House would extend duty relief that either already expired or will on Dec. 31.</blockquote>

Actually, my little <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/realtime/XqKHOtUa"">tariff database </a> does link to lobbyist disclosures (those I could find); of course, Grassley is right--Congress should do this itself, so I wouldn't have had to spend so many hours on it."		2009-03-16 15:56:31	2009-03-16 15:56:31	2009-03-16 15:56:31	1	0	1

John Murtha has been doing, and they've got documents to back them up:

<blockquote>A Pennsylvania defense research center regularly consulted with two ""handlers"" close to  Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.) as it collected nearly $250 million in federal funding through the lawmaker, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post and sources familiar with the funding requests. The center then channeled a significant portion of the funding to companies that were among Murtha's campaign supporters. 

The two advisers included a lobbyist for PMA Group, a firm with close ties to Murtha that is the subject of a federal investigation into whether it made illegal contributions by reimbursing donors to the Pennsylvania lawmaker and other members of Congress. The Electro-Optics Center also relied on advice from a longtime Murtha friend who now works on the congressman's appropriations staff. 

Federal agents are also exploring how the center obtained its funds after they received dozens of internal documents last year. It is unclear whether the records have become a central focus of the Justice Department's probe, but they open a window into a largely hidden process in which powerful lawmakers can direct funds to pet projects. </blockquote>

I don't think the Electro-Optics Center is unique in passing earmarked dollars on to private firms....

It's impossible to know how many of those bonuses would have been covered by Dodd's original language without examining the individual contracts. What is certain, however, is that the loophole regarding ""retroactivity"" which facilitated the payout of the bonuses that AIG cited in their white paper, was something that Treasury specifically lobbied for. </blockquote>

The Post writes,

<blockquote>The report underscores a ""worrying"" trend toward protectionism as countries rush to shield their ailing domestic industries during the global economic crisis. It comes one day after Mexico vowed to slap new restrictions on 90 U.S. products. That action is being taken in retaliation against Washington for canceling a program that allowed Mexican truck drivers the right to transport goods across the United States, illustrating the tit-for-tat responses that experts fear could grow in coming months.

The report comes ahead of an April 2 summit in London in which the heads of state from those 20 industrialized and developing economies will seek to shape a coordinated response to the economic crisis. Their inability to keep their November promises is another indication of how difficult it will be to implement any agreement reached next month on a global scale.</blockquote>

Obviously, a little broader than Congress' efforts on tariff suspensions. Well worth keeping an eye on this. The World Bank report includes this recommendation for G-20 countries:

<blockquote>Commit to greater transparency by agreeing to provide quarterly reports on new trade restrictions, and industrial and agricultural subsidies to the WTO, together with a mandatory analysis of the trade restriction on employment (since this would create new room for technical analysis and political discussion in countries themselves)...</blockquote>

74	Defense Contractors Reap Windfall in 2005 Earmarks	defense-contractors-reap-windfall-in-2005-earmarks	3	"By Larry Makinson and Anupama Narayanswamy

The nation's top defense contractors were also the biggest beneficiaries of congressional earmarks in 2005, an analysis by the Sunlight Foundation has found. Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics led the pack. Those four corporations collected a combined $1.09 billion in earmark awards. Overall, the top 20 corporate recipients of 2005 earmarks were all defense contractors.

The analysis was based on the database of earmarks from 2005 produced, and posted online, by the federal government's Office of Management and Budget. OMB collected the data from the agencies responsible for dispensing the money. The database does not include the names of members of Congress who asked for specific earmarks to be inserted onto the books, since members were not required to disclose this information.

The Sunlight Foundation standardized the data, linking subsidiaries to parents. Sunlight Labs developed its <a href=""http://sunlightlabs.com/ombearmarks/"">own interface</a> for searching and analyzing the improved data, and also offers <a href=""http://sunlightlabs.com/visualizingearmarks/"">visualizations</a> of the information using <a href=""http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/app"">Many Eyes</a>, part of IBM's <a href=""http://domino.watson.ibm.com/cambridge/research.nsf/pages/cue.html?Open"">Collaborative User Experience</a> research group.

Of the $18.9 billion in earmarks that were awarded, just under half -- $9.3 billion -- paid for Defense Department projects. The Department of Transportation was a distant second, with $3.2 billion in earmarks. Most of the transportation earmarks were passed on to state highway departments.

Seven major defense contractors collected over $100 million apiece in the earmarks sweepstakes, in which members of Congress short circuit the federal government's competitive bidding process and award funds directly to firms, specifying the winners in the language of bills, committee or conference reports, letters or other communications sent by members to federal agencies, and even statements made by members on the floor of the House or Senate.

Until 2007, members could insert earmarks anonymously. In January, the House adopted rules intended to improve public disclosure of earmarks, while the Senate rule to do the same has yet to be passed. (For a comparison of the House and Senate earmark reforms, <a href=""http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/node/2955"">click here</a>.

Those figures are conservative, since information, including the recipient, for millions in earmarked funds was withheld for security reasons. In other cases, earmarks specifying multiple recipients had a dollar amount listed, but the allocation of dollars among each recipient was not. For this analysis, those figures were not included.

All the top recipients -- and many others further down the list -- helped pave the way for their earmark awards through extensive lobbying efforts and campaign contributions. Each of the big seven is a well-established player in Washington's industry of influence, spending millions a year to lobby on a wide variety of issues ranging from federal tax and trade policy to health care to appropriations. The companies' employees and family members and political action committees donate hundreds of thousands of dollars each election cycle to members of Congress.

In 2004-the year in which the earmarks in the Office of Management and Budget's database were approved-Boeing reported spending almost $8.7 million lobbying the government. The PAC, employees and their family members of the aerospace giant contributed nearly $1.8 million to political campaigns in the 2004 election cycle. Northrop Grumman reported spending almost $12.6 million on lobbying, and kicked in $2 million to the coffers of federal candidates seeking office in 2004.

Because lobbying disclosure forms do not require filers to specify how much they spent lobbying on each specific issue, it is impossible to determine how much they spent seeking earmarks.

All lobbying and campaign contribution amounts are from the Center for Responsible Politics; for a fuller list and more details on the top for profit, nonprofit, university and state recipients of earmarks, download <a href=""http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/files/Copy%20of%20Top20spreadsheet.xls"">this spreadsheet</a>.

According to Sunlight's analysis of the earmarks, some $5.6 billion went to for-profit corporations. Federal government agencies received a combined $2.8 billion followed by state agencies ($2.3 billion) and local governments ($2.2 billion). Public educational institutions, including state universities received about $1.7 billion, as did nonprofit groups. Nearly $1 billion was classified as ""other"" by OMB, while $408 million went to private educational institutions.

<blockquote>An executive at mortgage giant Countrywide Financial overrode the company's loan-writing policies to give a discount to Sen. Christopher Dodd, the powerful chairman of the Senate banking committee, according to an internal Countrywide document turned over to congressional investigators and obtained by The Courant.</blockquote>

The Courant notes that the report, some 63 pages long, is from House Republicans on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee -- the whole thing is <a href=""http://republicans.oversight.house.gov/News/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=487"">here</a>. I think it's significant because we're beginning to get more detail about how Countrywide Financial's programs worked:

<blockquote>An internal ""Loan Policy Analysis"" of Dodd's mortgages shows that Countrywide's underwriting rules called for an interest rate of 4.875 percent on both loans, with fees equal to three-eighths of a point on one loan, and a quarter-point on the other. A point is equal to 1 percent of the borrowed amount, and for both mortgages, those up-front fees would have totaled about $2,500.

But the computerized record includes a second column showing what Dodd and his wife, Jackie Clegg, were actually charged. In that column, the points had been eliminated.

According to investigators, Countrywide's computer system required a manual override to implement loan terms more favorable than the company's standard underwriting policy. In Dodd's computer files, in a column labeled ""Reason For Override,"" is the designation: ""CMD Approved"" Ã¢â‚¬â€ which investigators say is shorthand for approval by a Countrywide managing director.

Read the whole thing. This bit really caught my eye:

<blockquote>The sheer volume of donations from PMA lobbyists raises questions. For example, Sandra K. Welch retired from PMA two years ago as a lobbyist with expertise in education. Her husband was a police officer in Fairfax County, Va. They now live in a Florida home for which they paid about $197,000, according to real-estate records.

Between 2003 and 2006, the couple contributed $121,000 to congressional campaigns as well as $5,000 annually to PMA's political-action committee. From 2001 to 2006, the couple contributed $12,300 to Dicks' campaign, with the Fairfax police officer listed in campaign-disclosure records as a PMA consultant.

Welch, reached at home, said she did not feel comfortable talking about PMA Group.</blockquote>

He cites the AIG bonus flap, and Congress' reaction to it (including the outrage of members and the House passing a <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h1586/show"">bill</a> that would tax 90 percent of those bonuses away) as evidence of the fickleness of Congressional favor. Reynolds writes,

<blockquote>In light of this behavior, Wall Street--if it survives long enough--will likely conclude that subsidizing these pols was a bad idea.

If so, maybe it's time to shut off the funding. Politicians are already gearing up for the 2010 election season. That means many of the same members of Congress who are currently running with the lynch mob will be back in search of more contributions soon enough.

Perhaps folks in the financial industry should tell them no and consider donating to candidates who believe in free markets--and who possess a bit of backbone--instead.</blockquote>

Remember that AIG's <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?cycle=A&type=P&id=D000000123"">largesse</a> -- $9,342,839 in individual, PAC, soft money and 527 contributions since the 1989 election cycle -- is dwarfed by the $170 billion in support the firm has gotten. That's $18,195 for every dollar contributed. It certainly seems like subsidizing the pols led to quite a good return, as it did for Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, General Motors and others. Contrast the treatment financial companies got from the <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h1424/show"">Emergency Economic Stabilization Act</a>, which lavished <a href=""http://www.subsidyscope.com/projects/bailout/tarp/"">billions</a> on bank holding companies, financial firms and other big donors, with the misleadingly named <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s109-256"">Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005</a>, which shifted the burden of irresponsible lending practices by credit card companies and irresponsible borrowing and buying by credit card holders entirely onto the latter. It is perhaps needless to say that employees, their immediate family members, and PACs of <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/contrib.php?cycle=2008&ind=F06"">credit card companies</a> are far more generous supporters of political campaigns than people struggling to make ends meet and thinking of defaulting on their debts. 

Overwhelming majorities of politicians in the <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=s2005-44"">Senate</a> and the <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h2005-108"">House</a> proved themselves to be perfectly willing to sacrifice the protections that bankruptcy laws afforded to ordinary citizens. Similarly, politicians of both parties--including free market conservatives opposed to government interventions in markets and anti-big-business liberals who'd railed against the excesses of Wall Street--were only too happy to make American taxpayers bail out their big donors. 

Financial firms get it: It's not what politicians say, it's what they do. And what they do, ultimately, is take care of their contributors. If a few AIG employees have to be hung out to dry once in a while to make it appear something else is going on, so be it."		2009-03-25 03:13:56	2009-03-25 03:13:56	2009-03-25 03:13:56	1	0	1
76	OGE working toward electronic filing of financial disclosure forms	oge-working-toward-electronic-filing-of-financial-disclosure-forms	2	"Members of Congress aren't the only ones to file publicly available <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/"">personal financial disclosure forms</a>; so do presidents, cabinet secretaries, high ranking officials, and others throughout the upper echelons of our government. Just as with the legislative branch, the public must be afforded the opportunity to determine whether administration officials have potential conflicts of interest. 

The agency responsible for collecting these forms is the <a href=""http://www.usoge.gov/home.html"">Office of Government Ethics</a> (OGE); they collect paper <a href=""http://www.usoge.gov/pages/forms_pubs_otherdocs/fpo_files/forms/fr278_00.pdf"">forms SF 278</a> (which are maintained by OGE and available to the public) and disseminate paper <a href=""http://www.usoge.gov/pages/forms_pubs_otherdocs/fpo_files/forms/oge450_2006/oge450_automated_06.pdf"">OGE forms 450</a>, which are filed by lower level employees, are not available to the general public, and are maintained by each employee's agency.

OGE has been trying to get approval from the <http://www.omb.gov"">Office of Management and Budget</a> to develop an electronic filing system for this data. Some of this data (that filed by those submitting forms SF 278), could presumably be gotten through the Freedom of Information Act, which in turn could be made into a searchable database that would give the public access to instant information on who in the executive branch owned what. OMB, which has been <a href=""http://www.omb.gov/earmarks"">good</a> in advancing online transparency in some areas, seems to have dropped the ball on this one.

Via the excellent <a href=http://www.iecjournal.org/iec/2007/06/electronic_fili.html"">IEC Journal</a> comes this <a href=""http://www.usoge.gov/pages/daeograms/dgr_files/2007/do07014.txt"">memorandum</a> from OGE's director, Robert I. Cusick:

<blockquote>At OGEÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s recent National Ethics Conference, in Orlando, Florida, I discussed OGEÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s plans for any continued involvement in the development of an executive branch-wide system for electronic filing of the public and confidential financial disclosure reports.

As some of you may know, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) informed OGE that its request to undertake an OMB sanctioned e-Gov Initiative for the development of an e-filing system for financial disclosure reports in the executive branch will not be approved.  OGE considered the possibility of attempting to manage an informal non-OMB sanctioned e-Gov initiative, but rejected that approach because OGE has neither the finances nor staff resources to oversee such an uphill effort of a strictly voluntary nature without definite funding sources.

Instead, OGE decided to allow each agency to undertake its own development of an electronic filing process to use with either the public (SF 278) or confidential (OGE Form 450) reporting system.  </blockquote>

Allowing each agency to develop its own process sounds like an invitation to data anarchy. To its credit, OGE seems to be trying to avoid that. It will be interesting to see whether OGE can get uniform data from all agencies, and whether that in turn will be made available to the public in an online form."		2007-06-16 15:14:04	2007-06-16 15:14:04	2007-06-16 15:14:04	1	0	1

In <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3178/3178.txt"">The Gilded Age</a>, by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner, a member of the Senate, Abner Dilworthy, is caught bribing a state legislator to ensure his reelection. Dilworthy knows how to respond:

<blockquote>Yes, the nation was excited, but Senator Dilworthy was calm--what was left of him after the explosion of the shell.  Calm, and up and doing. What did he do first?  What would you do first, after you had tomahawked your mother at the breakfast table for putting too much sugar in your coffee?  You would ""ask for a suspension of public opinion.""  That is what Senator Dilworthy did.  It is the custom.  He got the usual amount of suspension.  Far and wide he was called a thief, a briber, a promoter of steamship subsidies, railway swindles, robberies of the government in all possible forms and fashions.  Newspapers and everybody else called him a pious hypocrite, a sleek, oily fraud, a reptile who manipulated temperance movements, prayer meetings, Sunday schools, public charities, missionary enterprises, all for his private benefit.  And as these charges were backed up by what seemed to be good and sufficient, evidence, they were believed with national unanimity.

Then Mr. Dilworthy made another move.  He moved instantly to Washington and ""demanded an investigation.""  Even this could not pass without, comment.  Many papers used language to this effect:

""Senator Dilworthy's remains have demanded an investigation.  This sounds fine and bold and innocent; but when we reflect that they demand it at the hands of the Senate of the United States, it simply becomes matter for derision.  One might as well set the gentlemen detained in the public prisons to trying each other.  This investigation is likely to be like all other Senatorial investigations--amusing but not useful.  Query.  Why does the Senate still stick to this pompous word, 'Investigation?'  One does not blindfold one's self in order to investigate an object.""</blockquote>

Discovery should be pretty interesting. 

I don't seem to be able to post the document, but this quote is interesting:

<blockquote>Since the 1980s, United Guaranty has used a Ã¢â‚¬Å“delegated modelÃ¢â‚¬Â for underwriting. Underwriting is the process whereby an insurer determines the risk associated with a loan and decides whether to offer insurance. Under the delegated model, United Guaranty does not underwrite each loan itself. Instead, it relies on the lender to accurately represent information on the loans to be insured. For example, the lender may represent that the loans satisfy certain underwriting guidelines such as minimum credit scores or maximum loan-to-value ratios. Based on the lenderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s representations, United Guaranty then decides whether to offer insurance. This model is efficient, cost-effective, and preferred by many lenders.</blockquote>

As part of the stimulus efforts, the <a href=""http://www.rrb.gov/"">Railroad Retirement Board</a>, an independent agency that manages federal benefits for railroad retirees and their dependents (more details on why this board exists <a href=""http://www.rrb.gov/opa/agency_overview.asp"">here</a>) will send additional checks of $250 to most of its beneficiaries, ""including disabled adult children."" 

A disabled adult child is a dependent of a railroad pensioner--or <a href=""http://www.ssa.gov/dibplan/dacpage.shtml"">Social Security beneficiary</a>--who, because of his disability, is eligible to continue receiving his benefits based on his parent's or parents' earnings after their deaths. The Social Security Administration defines the term this way: ""An adult disabled before age 22 may be eligible for child's benefits if a parent is deceased or starts receiving retirement or disability benefits. We consider this a ""child's"" benefit because it is paid on a parent's Social Security earnings record.""

There must be better ways of describing this--disabled child adult at least acknowledges that the individual is an adult rather than a child, while the slightly longer ""eligible adult disabled in childhood"" would seem even more precise, until we recall that 22 is the upper limit of childhood--when children are eligible to marry, vote, borrow, drink, smoke or even join the military."		2009-03-26 13:06:43	2009-03-26 13:06:43	2009-03-26 13:06:43	1	0	1

The documents, obtained by Falcon for his investigation, were ""commercial information"" exempt from disclosure, according to a lawyer for the Federal Housing Finance Agency.</blockquote>

Freddie Mac executives cooked the books, mismanaged the firm, and ultimately drove it into the ground, costing taxpayers billions of dollars. The ""commercial information"" exemption is reserved for private companies--Freddie Mac is by no means a private company anymore. 

Sector and Zajac did get contemporaries of Emanuel to describe his participation on the company's board:

<blockquote>One of Emanuel's fellow directors at Freddie Mac was Neil Hartigan, the former Illinois attorney general. Hartigan said Emanuel's primary contribution was explaining to others on the board how to play the levers of power.

He was respected on the board for his understanding of ""the dynamics of the legislative process and the executive branch at senior levels,"" Hartigan recalled. ""I wouldn't say he was outspoken. What he was, was solid.""</blockquote>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">For example, Gwen Smider, a FOIA officer working with the Defense Intelligence Agency, said that we could expect Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºsubstantial delays.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ She mentioned that their FOIA office has only eight staffers Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¬ a combination of government employees and contract workers supplied by Phacil, a defense contractor. Once their office receives a FOIA request, they send it to the specific office that handles the issue, in this case the office that would respond to congressional requests. None of these smaller departments have employees specifically assigned to handle FOIA requests; they have to made do with the personnel they have, who obviously have other responsibilities. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">According to Smider, there are 2800 FOIAs pending within the DIA and their office has received about 350 since Oct. 2006.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I also talked to Brian Kinsey, Senior FOIA Officer at the DIA. According to Kinsey, the department is Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºstill answering individual FOIA requests from the 1990sÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ and said that most of the delays were because they had fewer staffers working on FOIA since the Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºglobal war on terrorism requires a lot of personnel.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹</p>

The whole letter is worth reading -- it serves almost as a primer on recent congressional scandals -- and all the recommendations are excellent, but if I had to pick just one, it would be this one:

<blockquote>2. Better Disclosure of Business Partners and Joint Investors: While current rules call for disclosure of assets of the lawmaker, there is no requirement that co-ownership of closely held investments be disclosed. There have been numerous examples in which special interests have curried improper favors with elected officials by including the official in a purported investment. In these cases, the officeholder typically receives an extraordinary return on investment with little or no risk. 

Rep. Alan Mollohan (D-WI) was recently discovered to have had millions of dollars in financial partnerships with three individuals associated with groups that collectively received more than $100 million in federal funds through MollohanÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s assistance. While there were numerous omissions and misrepresentations of MollohanÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s assets in his FDR, he was never required to disclose the names of his business partners. Sen. Ted Stevens (R-AK) and Rep. Dennis Hastert (R-IL) Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¬ along with many other lawmakers - have had financial partners and co-investors who never were required to be disclosed.</blockquote>

806	Feds: Freddie Mac should hide info from SEC	feds-freddie-mac-should-hide-info-from-sec	2	"Yesterday, we learned from the <a href=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/obama/chi-rahm-emanuel-profit-26-mar26,0,5682373.story"">Chicago Tribune</a> that Freddie Mac documents are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act because they contain or might compromise commercial information--that is, the proprietary insider information of a private company. Today, in the <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/26/AR2009032604292.html?hpid=topnews"">Washington Post</a>, we learn that that private company was pressured to withhold negative information it was obligated to disclose under SEC rules. It seems that following government policy will adversely affect its bottom line, and the firm wanted to tell its remaining shareholders that.

<blockquote>Federal officials who took over Freddie Mac stopped short of nationalizing the company, leaving it partly in private hands. This means Freddie still has to answer to investors and file financial disclosures.

But when Freddie Mac's executives concluded a few weeks ago that they had to disclose that the government's management of the McLean company was undermining its profitability and would cost it tens of billions of dollars, the firm's regulator urged it not to do so, according to several sources familiar with the matter....

As Freddie Mac executives were preparing their annual 10-K financial disclosure this month, they reported that carrying out the Obama administration's housing plan would cost $30 billion this year. That sum would have to be covered by the Treasury Department. The federal government has pledged to cover $200 billion each in losses for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, of which the pair have asked for about $60 billion.

The housing agency asked that the cost of the program be withheld and that the firm soften language describing how government management was undercutting profitability, according to sources. </blockquote>

Freddie Mac ultimately included the disclosures, after negotiating on the wording with federal regulators, the article says.

811	Following Dirty Money	following-dirty-money	2	"I like the concept behind what appears to be a new Washington Examiner feature called ""Dirty Money"" (you can see the latest installment <a href=""http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/Dirty-Money-Rep-Pete-Stark-D-CA--41943687.html"">here</a>; I can't seem to find a page where <a href=""http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/Dirty-Money-Sen-Barbara-Mikulski-D-MD-41897307.html"">previous installments</a> are archived). I'm not a hundred percent certain though of their methodology of determining why certain contributions are dirty--if it's merely a company or organization that had employees or members who've committed crimes (embezzlement is one listed), that doesn't necessarily seem to taint the organization's donations. I think a little more context is needed to determine whether the employees were embezzling from the organization (which would seem to make the organization a victim) or if the embezzlement was part of a management scheme to victimize others. 

Freddie Mac strikes me as a much better place to start. The mortgage lender <a href=""http://www.ofheo.gov/media/pdf/specialreport122003.pdf"">cast aside accounting rules, internal controls, disclosure standards, and the public trust in the pursuit of steady earnings growth</a> -- a practice that led it to cook its books.

815	Must everything be earmarked?	must-everything-be-earmarked	2	"Columnist George Will <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032702504.html"">argues</a> that the <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h1424/show"">Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008</a> -- the bailout bill that set up <a href=""http://subsidyscope.com/projects/bailout/tarp/"">TARP</a>, is unconstitutional because it delegates legislative power to the executive branch:

<blockquote>Congress did not in any meaningful sense make a law. Rather, it made executive branch officials into legislators. Congress said to the executive branch, in effect: ""Here is $700 billion. You say you will use some of it to buy up banks' 'troubled assets.' But if you prefer to do anything else with the money -- even, say, subsidize automobile companies -- well, whatever.""

FreedomWorks, a Washington-based libertarian advocacy organization, argues that EESA violates ""the nondelegation doctrine."" Although the text does not spell it out, the Constitution's logic and structure -- particularly the separation of powers -- imply limits on the size and kind of discretion that Congress may confer on the executive branch.

The Vesting Clause of Article I says, ""All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in"" Congress. All. Therefore, none shall be vested elsewhere.</blockquote>

Will includes this bit of history about the dangers of allowing the Executive Branch too much discretion in how money shall be spent:

<blockquote>Writing in the New Republic, Jeffrey Rosen of George Washington University Law School makes a prudential point: ""The military-spending scandals during World War II, exposed by the Truman Committee, showed the risks for corruption and fraud when the executive branch is given a free hand to spend vast amounts of money."" But even in the unlikely event that the executive branch exercises its excessive EESA discretion efficiently, the mere exercise would nevertheless subvert the principle of separation of powers, which, as Justice Louis Brandeis said, was adopted ""not to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power."" </blockquote>

This seems to be remarkably close to how some members of Congress defend their earmarks. <a href=""http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/73804/"">Via Instapundit</a>, here's John Murtha's <a href=""http://www.tribune-democrat.com/local/local_story_077234514.html"">response</a> to charges he wasted a lot of taxpayer money on projects that were vetted, not by a rigorous procurement process with competitive bids, but rather through some backroom process known only to Murtha, his staff and lobbyists:

<blockquote>U.S. Rep. John Murtha, D-Johnstown, responded by waving the Constitution at the camera, saying: Ã¢â‚¬Å“What it says is the Congress of the United States appropriates the money. Got that?Ã¢â‚¬Â </blockquote>

It seems that no matter where one vests the power to make such decisions, there is a risk of corruption and fraud. It might be more profitable to insist on greater transparency in the process (flip a coin? throw a dart at a list of Fortune 500 companies?) Treasury officials use to decide who gets TARP funds, as well as greater transparency in how members like Murtha mysteriously direct so many earmarks to <a href=""http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h8rgzsMbWVVwSsWT0qoOHKMuaAxQD973QNJG0"">firms and clients of firms</a> that shower them with campaign contributors."		2009-03-29 13:45:56	2009-03-29 13:45:56	2009-03-29 13:45:56	1	0	1

<blockquote>...many on Capitol Hill, recalling the scandal that mushroomed around the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, are wondering who else will be ensnared in the investigation as prosecutors pore over the financial records and computer files of one of K StreetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most influential lobbyists, known both for the billions of dollars in earmarks he obtained for his clients and for his open hand toward those he sought to influence.

Former PMA staff members familiar with the inquiry say prosecutorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ initial questions have focused on the possibility that Mr. Magliocchetti used straw campaign contributors Ã¢â‚¬â€ a Florida sommelier and a golf club executive, for example, appear to have given large sums in coordination with PMA Ã¢â‚¬â€ as a front to funnel illegal donations to friendly lawmakers, a felony that could carry a minimum sentence of five years.

More alarming to lawmakers and aides, however, is that prosecutors may turn their attention to the dinners at the Alpine and Capital Grille or other gifts they might have accepted from Mr. Magliocchetti Ã¢â‚¬â€ potential violations of longstanding Congressional ethics rules that could lead to more serious bribery charges if linked to official acts.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“All the combustibles are here for a very salacious set of allegations that could go far beyond his campaign finance problems,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Stanley Brand, a veteran Washington criminal defense lawyer known for representing Democrats. </blockquote>

I've thought this <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/03/05/senate-approves-earmarks-for-pma-group-clients/"">for quite a while</a>: ""Abramoff was a sort of Bernard Madoff character, unique in his personal excesses, corrosively corrupting, but still just one guy. PMA Group is a methodical business. It rakes in millions of dollars in lobbying fees.

Its clients get hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks and billions more in federal contracts.""

83	FHWA discouraging FOIA requests from potential contractors?	fhwa-discouraging-foia-requests-from-potential-contractors	2	"Here's a little information on something we started <a href=http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/node/2118"">looking into last February</a>:

When a federal agency needs a contractor, it publishes a presolicitation notice on a site called <a href=""http://www.fedbizopps.gov/index.html"">FedBizOpps</a> to alert businesses that a formal solicitation is coming. These presolicitation notices -- here's <a href=""http://www.fbo.gov/spg/ODA/DeCA/DeCA-DOMS2/HDEC02-07-T-0002/SynopsisP.html"">one</a> -- describe what the contract would call for, often adding that additional information can be gotten through the Freedom of Information Act:
<blockquote>Any requests for business information not posted should be requested under Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) guidance.</blockquote>
There are several variations on the theme -- <a href=""http://www.fbo.gov/spg/DHS/USCG/FCPMLCP/HSCG89-08-R-6C6000/SynopsisP.html"">this one</a> tells bidders, ""All FOIA requests for the previous procurement information and pricing should be sent to the FOIA Control Officer, Jennifer Mitchell..."" and helpfully provides her email address.

Now, here's some rather different language from a Feb. 28, 2007, <a href=""http://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOT/FHWA/OAM/DTFH61-07-R-00123/SynopsisP.html"">presolicitation notice</a> from the Federal Highway Administration, which is opening a small portion of its Transportation Technology Innovation and Demonstration Program to competition (and a tip of the hat to the indefatigable Jerry Werner, a citizen investigator who came across it and pointed it out to me). The Hill <a href=""http://thehill.com/business--lobby/monopoly-continues-for-pa.-company-says-hatch-2007-06-26.html"">recently noted</a> that Sen. Orrin Hatch characterized the $50 million-plus program as being a monopoly awarded to the incumbent contractor, Mobility Technologies, Inc. Here's what FHWA advises would-be bidders:
<blockquote>Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for copies of Mobility Technologies, Inc.'s INCUMBENT contract document are unlikely to be fruitful for organizations wishing to compete for this FOLLOW-ON project, for the following reasons: (a) the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) routinely REDACTS, from contract documents furnished to FOIA requesters, all pricing data and all staffing data; (b) the Statement of Work that will be published hereafter in the Solicitation (RFP) for this FOLLOW-ON project will be self-contained and will stand alone and will DIFFER in many crucial respects from the Statement of Work set forth in Mobility Technologies Inc.'s INCUMBENT contract document; (c) any attempt, by an offeror submitting a proposal for this follow-on project, to respond to the INCUMBENT contract's Statement of Work would almost certainly call into serious question the offeror's grasp of, and commitment to attaining, the technical objectives of this follow-on project; and (d) given the time-consuming procedure governing the FHWA's processing of FOIA requests, it is unlikely that even an extensively redacted and probably useless copy of Mobility Technologies Inc.'s INCUMBENT contract document could be made available to any FOIA requester before the due date for submitting PROPOSALS under this follow-on procurement.</blockquote>

I'd FOIAed that very contract <a href=""http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/node/2118"">last February</a>, and received a copy of it in June, without any of the redactions described above (a copy is <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/mobility-task-order.pdf"" title=""Incumbent Contract Document"">attached</a>). It seemed odd that the presolicitation notice would go out of its way to discourage FOIAing the previous task order, particularly when it was relatively easy for me to get hold of it.

Curious, I called Bob Robel, a contracting officer at the Department of Transportation and the point of contact for this particular presolicitation notice, and asked whether this was standard language from the FHWA. He told me it wasn't, and explained that the passage means that companies seeking the follow-on contract shouldn't wait around for their FOIA response to be filled if they want to win this business. ""The technical office wrote that, the program office wrote that just to tell people that the new effort is similar to the one undertaken by Mobility Technologies,"" he said, adding that the contract is ""available if you want it, but IÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´m not sure it would be helpful. If you wanted to obtain that you certainly could, but it takes time. [The notice is] trying to tell you that you shouldnÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´t wait around.""

I suggested that some of the language seemed to be a little tougher, particularly the bit saying, ""any attempt, by an offeror submitting a proposal for this follow-on project, to respond to the INCUMBENT contract's Statement of Work would almost certainly call into serious question the offeror's grasp of, and commitment to attaining, the technical objectives of this follow-on project.""

Robel said that the passage on FOIA had been written by the FHWA <a href=""http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/"">Office of Operations</a>; I asked him who specifically, and he told me he couldn't tell me."		2007-07-09 21:02:55	2007-07-09 21:02:55	2007-07-09 21:02:55	1	0	1

847	K Street Boom: At least 1,699 new clients in 2009	k-street-boon-at-least-1699-new-clients-in-2009	2	"Lobbying firms and special interests have filed nearly <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/firstquarterregistrations/kxagXawt"">1,700 new registration forms</a> so far in the first quarter of 2009, according to a review of lobbying disclosure forms available online at the Senate Office of Public Records. As the federal government <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h1/show"">pumps</a> up <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h1/show"">spending</a> and intervenes in the troubled <a href=""http://www.subsidyscope.com"">financial markets</a>, K Street firms appear to have had no shortage of new business.

Our first pass at a <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/firstquarterregistrations/kxagXawt"">database</a> of the registrations shows that some of the financial firms that have received funding under the <a href=""http://subsidyscope.com/projects/bailout/tarp/"">Troubled Asset Relief Program</a> including <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/firstquarterregistrations/kxagXawt?keyword=citigroup"">Citigroup</a>, <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/firstquarterregistrations/kxagXawt?keyword=JP+Morgan+Chase+%26+Co."">JP Morgan Chase & Co.</a>, <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/firstquarterregistrations/kxagXawt?keyword=goldman+sachs"">Goldman Sachs</a> and <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/firstquarterregistrations/kxagXawt?keyword=fifth+third+bank"">Fifth Third Bank</a> have hired new firms to represent them in Washington. 

Governments are also scrambling for a piece of the action: <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/govlobbyingregs-1/zKDVyxRU"">134 state, municipal, county and local government entities</a>--ranging from the <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/govlobbyingregs-1/zKDVyxRU?keyword=state+of+connecticut"">Office of Policy Management</a> of the state of Connecticut to the <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/govlobbyingregs-1/zKDVyxRU?keyword=duneland"">Duneland School System</a> in Chesterton, Ind. Some 55 of the governments listed appropriations, funding for various projects or the economic stimulus as lobbying issues. We built a second database <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/govlobbyingregs-1/zKDVyxRU"">tracking governments lobbying the federal government</a> that includes links to the original lobbying forms.

While 1,699 new clients were signing up, there just 184 clients terminated their relationships with Washington lobbyists so far in 2009, including seven clients of PMA Group, which is under federal investigation. Two successor firms appear in the registration database: Flagship Government Relations has signed up at least <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/firstquarterregistrations/kxagXawt?keyword=flagship"">twelve clients</a>, while Capitol Consulting Group signed up <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/firstquarterregistrations/kxagXawt?keyword=capitol+consulting+group"">four</a>, including the now-defunct PMA Group.

It is still too early to determine how many new clients signed up in the first quarter. Lobbyists whose effective date of registration was the last day of the quarter, March 31, 2009, have 45 more days--until May 15--to file registration forms. (The rules for filing are <a href=""http://senate.gov/legislative/resources/pdf/S1guidance.pdf"">here</a>.) There is also a delay between when the Senate Office of Public Records (SOPR) receives forms and when they are posted online. That said, the registration forms posted online by SOPR give the first glimpse of who's lobbying for what in the 111th Congress. Quarterly lobbying reports, in which lobbying firms report payments they've received, list the government agencies they've contacted, and often specify bills they're attempting to influence, must be filed by <a href=""http://senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/filing_deadlines.htm"">April 20, 2009</a>.

The registration forms were posted on the SOPR site between January 1 and March 31, 2009, and are calendar year 2009 filings (there were more than 350 registrations from prior years that showed up on the site, including one from <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/04/01/timely-disclosure-fail/"">2002</a>."		2009-04-01 18:21:38	2009-04-01 18:21:38	2009-04-01 18:21:38	1	0	1
849	Bloomberg: Dodd faces campaign cash shortage	bloomberg-dodd-faces-campaign-cash-shortage	2	"Kristin Jensen and Jonathan D. Salant <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=avjtc7zpsFVM"">report</a> that Sen. Christopher Dodd is facing a cash crunch as he gears up for his reelection bid:

<blockquote> The Democrat has less than half the campaign cash he had at a comparable point in his last re-election bid, when he faced far fewer hurdles. Last year, he emptied an account built up largely through financial-company employeesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ donations to pay for a presidential run; now, he has to replenish his coffers even as the firms his panel regulates struggle with losses and back away from their one-time champion turned critic....

Dodd began the year with $670,654 on hand; by contrast, he had about $1.6 million at the same point in his last Senate race. He ended up spending $5.7 million for his 2004 election after raising a total of $7.1 million, according to the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics.

In 2007, Dodd transferred to his presidential campaign $4.7 million that had been raised for his 2010 Senate campaign. Now, many of his donors are already close to the maximum contribution limits per six-year election cycle, while Dodd is tied with Republican challenger and former Representative Rob Simmons, 66, according to a poll released on March 10 by Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut. </blockquote>

Be interesting to see what his haul is from his <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/party/8951/"">most</a> recent <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/party/9650/"">fundraisers</a>, the latter of which was held at the home of a lobbyist for financial firms <a href=""http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=79829761-c5d5-4293-987c-3e0016936733"">HSBC North America</a>, <a href=""http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=c9bb77bb-5da0-4324-a02c-6359bc182170"">Cigna Corporation</a> and <a href=""http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=0c3aaf88-d02f-4df9-b350-6f87b7043ee2"">Oz Management LP</a>. Still, with financial firms hammered or on the public dole and their executives worried about having their salaries capped and their bonuses taken away, will they be able to contribute (to all politicians, not just Dodd) as much as they <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=F"">have in the past</a>?

85	SF-LLL Update: Not for public inspection?	sf-lll-update-not-for-public-inspection	2	"My conversation with Department of Trasnsportation contracting officer Bob Robel (see the Moblity Technologies, Inc. post <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2007/07/09/fhwa-discouraging-foia-requests-from-potential-contractors/"">immediately below</a>) also yielded some interesting information on <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants/sflllin.pdf"">standard form LLL</a>, which contractors are supposed to file ""for each payment or agreement to make payment to any lobbying entity for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with a covered federal action."" (Covered federal action here refers to a federal contract or grant.)

Anu and I have been trying to see if we could get our hands on a big batch of SF-LLLs, with the idea that you could begin to separate companies that win contracts by going through the normal procurement process from those that hire lobbyists to attempt to influence members of Congress and administration officials outside that process to intervene on their behalf.

Sadly, we've had no success. I've been told by FOIA officers that agencies don't collect them, or aren't obligated to collect them, or that companies aren't asked to provide them. Anu has had much the same experience -- generally speaking, when we've inquired about the forms, we've known far more about them than the government officials who are supposed to be able to answer our questions.

My initial FOIA request to the Department of Transportation requesting information on Mobility Technologies asked for any SF-LLLs the company had filed in connection with the contracts it had won. The company and its various parents have lobbied quite a bit, as Kevin Bogardus <a href=""http://thehill.com/business--lobby/monopoly-continues-for-pa.-company-says-hatch-2007-06-26.html"">made clear</a> in the Hill:
<blockquote>The firm also has a substantial lobbying presence in Washington. Since 2000, the company, under its different names, has spent more than $900,000 on lobbying fees with at least 10 firms, according to Senate disclosure forms.</blockquote>
Though I requested them under the Freedom of Information Act, I've yet to receive any SF-LLLs filed by Mobility Technologies, and I suspect I might not, even though Transportation does appear to collect them. Take a look at the full solicitation, available in a Microsoft Word format at <a href=""http://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOT/FHWA/OAM/DTFH61-07-R-00123/Attachments.html"">this link</a>, which prompted my call to Robel -- requesting companies to submit proposals for the ""Deployment of Part II of the Transportation Technology Innovation and Demonstration Program Into the Dallas/Ft. Worth Metropolitan Area"" contract, worth about $2 million. On page 49, we read,
<blockquote><strong><standard></standard></strong>

Disclosure of Lobbying Activities must be completed and submitted as a part of your cost/price proposal. The Form (see Section J, Attachment No. 3) as revised in 1997 is available at http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do?formType=SF  under the forms section.</blockquote>
I asked Robel what happens to the forms when they're submitted as part of a proposal to get a contract. Here's what he told me:
<blockquote>The form along with any other documents submitted are kept confidential during pre-award process. The only people who have access are those with a need to know... We use those forms to evaluate if thereÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s some sort of conflict of interest or potential problem that our legal people need to know about.

Once weÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ve made an award, all that material from unsuccessful bidders is kept in a secure room here in our headquarters for a period of time, then we destroy it at the end of that time. The successful proposal is kept here about seven years, unsuccessful proposals are kept for about six months.</blockquote>
Robel told me that SF-LLLs are not available for public inspection -- that they're ""kept in a secure place so that no one has access to them."" Yet if one looks on the <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants/sflllin.pdf"">form itself</a>, on box 11, it clearly reads, ""This information will be available for public inspection.""

This raises a number of interesting questions; one thing I want to do is to look through solicitation notices from other federal agencies listed on <a href=""http://www.fedbizopps.gov/"">FedBizOpps</a> that mention SF-LLLs, contact the contract officers, and see if they handle the forms the same way Robel says Transportation handles them -- keeping them in a secure place so that no one has access to them."		2007-07-09 22:45:44	2007-07-10 03:56:01	2007-07-09 22:45:44	1	0	1

<blockquote>In 2005, former House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) stuffed a $207 million earmark in a federal highway bill to help pay for the road, estimated to cost $1 billion to build. The 37-mile highway would roll through Kane and Kendall Counties, linking I-80 and I-88, the Reagan Memorial Tollway.

Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.), who replaced Hastert, said Wednesday there is ""a near consensus in the area,"" that ""the first priority for money being spent on roads is probably not in that (Prairie Parkway) corridor but rather beefing up the existing north south corridors and so on.""

Since the earmark money was never spent, Foster wants to try to ""reprogram"" the money for other projects. Congress would have to approve, ""which is normally not done, but there may be a strong enough consensus to make that happen,"" Foster said.</blockquote>

In February, the House Appropriations Committee issued a new rule concerning FY10 earmark requests: Ã¢â‚¬Å“To offer more opportunity for public scrutiny of Member requests, Members must post information on the requests they have submitted to the Appropriations Committee on their official House website at the time the request is made.  The Appropriations Committee will consider funding only those requests that have been so posted.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not often that I praise the House Appropriations Committee, but they deserve some credit for this modest reform,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Flake.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I just hope that all Members making earmark requests have complied, and that the Appropriations Committee strictly enforces this rule by not considering earmark requests that have not been posted online by today.Ã¢â‚¬Â</blockquote>

<blockquote>Ask Wayne B.

""We're trying to stimulate good-quality research,"" said Jonas, a former chief of the Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) who directs the nonprofit Samueli Institute for Information Biology (SIIB) in Alexandria. ""There is a good case for looking at these things scientifically, because we don't know a lot about them.""</blockquote>

But are they looking scientifically?

<blockquote>Critics of the institute say that while they support rigorous research into alternative medical treatments, Samueli is not doing it.

""There is nothing of scientific value they're doing that I'm aware of,"" said Wallace Sampson, editor of the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine and clinical professor emeritus of medicine at Stanford. ""They're all ideologues trying to prove something that doesn't exist.""</blockquote>

The institute's patrons, Henry and Susan Samueli, contributed $20,000 to Moran's campaign committee and another $3,000 to Moran's leadership PAC, the Virginia Leadership PAC. Henry Samueli pled guilty to stock fraud, but Moran <a href=""http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13351.html"">stood by principle</a> and insisted on keeping the money."		2009-04-03 21:39:37	2009-04-03 21:39:37	2009-04-03 21:39:37	1	0	1

Tom Coburn has written to Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates requesting, among other things, SF-LLLs (good luck, Senator!). The full letter is <a href='http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/coburn21csi.pdf' title='coburn21csi.pdf'>attached</a>; here's an excerpt...

<blockquote>As you know, federal law (31 U.S.C. 1352) requires recipients of federal funding to complete a form, know as SF-LLL, to disclose lobbying activities.  The filing of a SF-LLL form is required of all recipients of federal contracts, grants, loans, and cooperative agreements.  The law requires Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºa certificationÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ that no federal funds were used to lobby the federal government.

This was passed, in part, to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not spent to hire lobbyists or lobby for additional taxpayer assistance.

When my office requested the SF-LLL form filed by a company receiving federal grants and earmarks from the Department of Defense, no such form could be produced for inspection by the Department.

On July 12, 2007, investigators from my office requested the SF-LLL form for 21st Century Systems, Inc. (21CSI), a Nebraska-based company, that has received more than $36 million in federal contracts since fiscal year 2000.  After nearly a week of back and forth, my office was told by a liaison of the Department on July 18, Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂº[W]hile we are aware of this form it is not something we are provided a copy of, so ESC (Hanscom AFB) does not have a copy on file.  My recommendation which may come from a lack of understanding of the real use of this document would be to go to the contractor and request a copy.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹</blockquote>

Now I don't feel so bad for getting almost the <a href=""http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/node/2246"">same answer</a> when I FOIAed Hanscom Air Force Base for an SF-LL (""We do not maintain these forms; therefore, we have no records to give you."").

Transportation keeps them under <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2007/07/09/sf-lll-update-not-for-public-inspection/"">lock and key</a>, the Coast Guard says <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2007/05/01/coast-guard-never-requested-deepwater-sf-llls/"">it doesn't request them</a>, and most agencies we've contacted--including the Office of Management and Budget, which is responsible for publishing the form--act like they've never heard of them.

Among the tariff suspension bills considered by the 110th Congress, which went out of business before passing any of the <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/realtime/XqKHOtUa"">them</a>, one stood out: the <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h3934/show"">Affordable Footwear Act</a>. Most tariff suspension bills--which temporarily reduce taxes on imported goods--have only one sponsor. This one drew 157 co-sponsors. Most tariff bills benefit one firm, or at most a handful of firms; this one was accompanied by <a href=""http://waysandmeans.house.gov/media/pdf/110/HR3934.pdf"">111 pages of letters</a>, all but three of which were from supporters. Most tariff bills cost the Treasury at most a couple of million while they're in effect; this one had at 2009 price tag of  <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/realtime/XqKHOtUa?keyword=H.R.+3934"">$810 million</a>; over five years, it would cost <a href=""http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/other/rel_doc/bill_reports/110c/hr3934.pdf"">$4.5 billion,</a> according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. 

Now, it's back. The <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s730/show"">Affordable Footwear Act</a> -- which on my first skim looks exactly like the last Affordable Foot Act -- was introduced in the Senate by Sen.

894	Links to House earmark disclosures in one database	links-to-house-earmark-disclosures-in-one-database	2	"House members had to post their earmark requests for fiscal year 2010 online this weekend; the original deadline was <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/04/03/earmark-requests-due-online-today/"">Friday</a>, but that was extended to <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/04/03/congress.earmarks/"">Saturday at 5 p.m.</a>, according to CNN.

So how many members made the deadline? I can't be sure, but I <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/seemembersearmarkrequests-1/ztqMeVhe"">tried to find out over the weekend</a>. I went through 430-some Web sites (there are a few vacancies right now -- Rahm Emanuel's seat, Hilda Solis' seat, and Kirsten Gillibrand's seat) looking for those disclosures (sometimes it was really interesting, sometimes it was thankless drudgery). On 116 Web pages, I couldn't find any earmark disclosures (some of these may be from members who don't disclose earmarks -- I used the Club for Growth's <a href=""http://clubforgrowth.org/2009/02/swearing_off_pork_in_2009.php"">list</a> of earmark abstainers, but found that some members on it -- like <a href=""http://www.hunter.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=126&amp;Itemid=60"">Rep. Duncan Hunter</a> -- did request earmarks. There were also four members who looked like they were set up to disclose earmarks, but hadn't posted any content.

As I <a href=""http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/04/03/earmark-request-disclosures-show-chaotic-inconsistencies/"">suspected</a>, the disclosures are useless if you want to aggregate them for the entire House. Some members posted unreadable pdfs (I indicated this sometimes in the notes). Some posted charts. Some have press releases for every single earmark, others have downloadable Word documents. Some members posted the complete request letters (again, I tried to indicate this), others posted the bare minimum amount of information.

Have a look at <a href=""https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/seemembersearmarkrequests-1/ztqMeVhe"">what I found</a>, and if I've missed things, please leave them in comments below. I suspect a lot of members will be adding disclosures to their sites today.

The most amazing thing (which I thought about as I did this) is that I believe this is the first time members have been required to use their official Web sites for disclosure. Next time, let's hope they plan a little better so that the information is easier to get to.

<strong>Update:</strong> You can download my data <a href=""http://realtime.dabbledb.com/publish/seemembersearmarkrequests-1/ac82c93f-ab87-4028-8c4d-dce0274cecba/mainview.xls"">here</a> in an Excel spreadsheet. Another note: in some of the comments, I noted whether or not the disclosure was hard to find. This was largely subjective, but basically, if I had to scroll to the bottom of a lengthy page that seemed to have nothing do with earmarks to find the disclosure, I labeled it hard to find. These were definitely hard for me to find, anyway...

<strong>Update 2:</strong> There are 292 members who had earmark disclosures online when I finished my work. That figure does not include an erroneous link to a Don Young disclosure, linked from his home page. That was for FY 2009 requests, not FY 2010.

<strong>Update 3: </strong>Rep. Allyson Schwartz's list of earmark requests is under a section titled ""Fighting For My Constituents' Priorities."" Just updated the database."		2009-04-06 18:19:43	2009-04-06 18:19:43	2009-04-06 18:19:43	1	0	1
902	Making sense of online earmark disclosures	making-sense-of-online-earmark-disclosures	2	"As noted <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/04/06/links-to-house-earmark-disclosures-in-one-database/"">immediately below</a>, House members started disclosing, on their official Web sites, their requests for earmarks (which members use to allocate federal funds for specific projects and recipients) last Friday. Over the weekend, I started looking at the disclosures, more to see what format the disclosures were in rather than whether they were online by a certain time. Since Roll Call <a href=""http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/01/06/inouye-obey-promise-earmark-reforms/"">first reported</a> the changes, this has been a <a href=""http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/01/06/inouye-obey-promise-earmark-reforms/#comment-49336"">concern</a> of mine. 

If members used the same format for disclosure, it would be a simple matter for us or anyone else to download all the data and put them into an online tool like <a href=""http://www.earmarkwatch.org"">Earmark Watch</a> that lets constituents research projects in their area and comment on them. Instead, there's no consistency at all in formats--we have everything from PDF image files (pictures of pages that can't be searched) to elaborate charts--pretty much what I predicted <a href=""http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/01/06/inouye-obey-promise-earmark-reforms/#comment-49336"">here</a>.  I'm happy to see that Joe Germuska <a href=""http://blog.germuska.com/2009/04/06/more-like-translucent-than-transparent/"">has tried to parse</a> a few of these. He proves that smart programmers can make with this data more useful than I thought. That said, I'd much rather see what he could do to make formatted data more accessible, rather than spending his time fixing the data out of the starting block.

In my review of Web sites over the weekend, I missed several I should have seen. The most embarrassing oversight for me was missing, on her <a href=""http://wassermanschultz.house.gov/"">home page</a>, the <a href=""http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/fl20_schultz/AppropsFY10.html"">disclosures</a> of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schulz. The one thing I tried to be meticulous about was that I'd read every single word on every single home page--there would be nothing worse than saying I couldn't find something when someone had a big red flashing button saying ""Earmarks here"" on their home page. Wasserman Schulz had part of the release on the page, but I missed it the first time and also couldn't see it after an aide told me about it. I think that's because she disclosed on March 20 -- much earlier than anyone else (of the members who dated their disclosures, a few came in on March 31, but  most were in April). I think seeing the March 20 date was enough to make my eyes ignore the text of the release, despite my vow to read whole home pages. My fault.

(On a few occasions I did have trouble spotting things on home pages -- for whatever reason, it took me a long while to spot the link to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's <a href=""http://www.house.gov/pelosi/CommunityFundingRequests/"">requests</a> on her <a href=""http://www.house.gov/pelosi/"">home page</a>. That said, for most sites it took me less than a minute of hunting around to find the disclosures.)

Others that I missed and shouldn't have (and that staffers were kind enough to forward links to me) were: <a href=""http://www.costa.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=454&Itemid=26"">Rep. Jim Costa</a>, <a href=""http://serrano.house.gov/Links.aspx?ID=38"">Rep. Jose Serrano</a>, <a href=""http://vanhollen.house.gov/HoR/MD08/Legislation/Issues/FY10+Projects.htm"">Rep.

They've all been added to the database. Note though some of the locations of those list. Rep. John Yarmouth links to disclosures of his appropriations requests at the bottom of an <a href=""http://www.yarmuth.house.gov/?sectionid=12&sectiontree=2,12"">inside page</a> that explains to constituents how they can apply for federal grants and assistance. I should have seen it, but I didn't. And I still can't find a link on <a href=""http://boccieri.house.gov/index.html"">Rep. John Bocciera's site</a> to his list. The URL -- http://boccieri.house.gov/district/investments.shtml -- suggests it would be on the district page, but when I look there, I don't see anything about appropriations requests, or anywhere else, for that matter.

909	WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s manning the TARP desk?	who%e2%80%99s-manning-the-tarp-desk	2	"Less than half a dozen people are responsible for making the final decisions about which banks get part of the $700 billion in bailout money available through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, according to Department ofÃ‚Â  Treasury officials. In response to a Freedom of Information Act request made by the Sunlight Foundation in January for the members of the TARP Investment Committee, a FOIA officer recently responded with just four names, including Assistant Secretary, Neel Kashkari; Chief Investment Officer, James Lambright; Acting Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets, Karthik Ramanathan and Acting Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy, Ralph Monaco, all holdovers from the Bush administration.

As of March 27, 2009, Treasury had disbursed $303.4 billion of the $700 billion in TARP funds, and yet taxpayers don't know who is making those decisions. The most recent <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09539t.pdf"">Government Accountability Office report </a>critiques TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s process as not being sufficiently transparent. In response to the report and <a href=""http://www.mcclatchydc.com/251/story/65195.html"">news stories</a> Treasury issued a statement saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Transparency and accountability are central to ensuring that taxpayer funds are spent wisely.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Yet even finding out how many people make decisions has required a FOIA request and multiple phone calls with dozens of offices in the federal government. And I still don't have a definitive answer. According to a <a href=""http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/hp1262.htm"">press release</a> from November, there are two more names on the list: Don McLellan, Capital Purchase Program Manager and Howard Scheitzer, Chief Operating Officer.

In a brief phone conversation, Ralph Monaco, one of the members on the committee said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think there are supposed to be more people than these. Sometimes if they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t available others are appointed.Ã¢â‚¬Â But according to a Government Accountability Office official, a few of these spots on the TARP Investment Committee are filled on an interim basis because they are administrative appointees and some may need Senate Confirmation. As of yet, the Obama administration still hasn't named those appointees.

According to a report by the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the applications made by banks is first reviewed by the one of the federal banking agencies which includes the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision (banks regulated by the FDIC have their applications reviewed by FDIC officials, ans so on).Ã‚Â  The evaluation process begins with an FBA consultation which includes a review of the bankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most recent financial statements and quarterly data. Once approved these applications are passed on to the TARP Investment Committee, which is made up of senior Treasury officials on financial markets, economic policy, financial institutions and financial stability. If it passes this committee it goes on to the Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability who has the final say.

I'm trying to get a comprehensive list of people involved in the decision making in all these banking agencies andÃ‚Â  so far IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve received a list of names handling TARP related applications only from the OTS which is available <a href=""http://files.ots.treas.gov/4811331.pdf"">online</a>. OCCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s press person said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are keeping the names confidential and not reveal the names keeping what we have told other reporters as well.Ã¢â‚¬Â

IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m still waiting to hear back from the Federal Reserve and the FDIC spokesperson said, they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a list they can make available. Still digging, more on these soon."		2009-04-10 17:54:00	2009-04-10 17:54:00	2009-04-10 17:54:00	1	0	1

[Ted] Stevens' career in public serviceÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ has failed to file registration documents or pay fees since 2004, according to the Alaska Department of Law. In response to a FOIA request to the department for all documents filed by the Ted Stevens Foundation (recently renamed the North to the Future Foundation), we received papers filed in 2003 and were told by department officials that none had been filed since then.<o:p> </o:p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Any organization that is raising funds in the state of <st1:state w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Alaska</st1:place></st1:state> has to file registration forms, a copy of its form 990 -- the tax return nonprofits file with the Internal Revenue Service -- and pay a registration fee to the state. Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºIf they are a charitable organization that is going to solicit funds they are supposed to file a registration form with the Alaska Department of Law,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ Linda Turrini, an investigator with the state Inspector General's office said.<o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">A former official of the Ted Stevens Foundation acknowledged not filing documents as an oversight in an e-mail exchange. Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºYour original e-mail alerted us that through an oversight our charitable registration has lapsed,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ wrote Timothy McKeever, who was the chairman of the foundation until last year and is currently treasurer for StevensÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ 2008 senatorial campaign committee. Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºWe have sent the state a new registration form and the fee.  We have also asked for guidance on how to resolve any issues for the years when we did not register and await the response.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹<o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">According to McKeever, the foundation was Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºoriginally formed in 2000 but did not become active until 2003.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/filings.pdf"">The documents we received</a> from <st1:state w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">A<st1:state w:st=""on"">laska</st1:state></st1:place></st1:state> indicate that in 2002, the Ted Stevens Foundation received a donation from the senator's 527 Committee, the Northern Lights PAC. Until the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act -- better known as McCain Feingold -- took effect in November 2002, members of Congress could have their own 527s, which could raise unlimited sums from individuals, corporations, or labor unions. Stevens' 527, for example, took in <a href=""http://forms.irs.gov/politicalOrgsSearch/search/generatePDF.action?formId='522222043-8872-0007'&amp;formType=P72"">$25,000 directly from Veco Corp.</a>, which has lately made headlines in <st1:state w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Alaska</st1:place></st1:state>. Two of the firm's top executives pled guilty to bribing a group of <st1:state w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Alaska</st1:place></st1:state> state lawmakers, including the Steven's son, Ben. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In 2002, the Ted Stevens Foundation had total revenue of $55,000, of which $45,000 came from Stevens' 527<st1:place w:st=""on"">.</st1:place> In keeping with McKeever's statement, the 990s that the foundation filed with the IRS reflect a sharp increase in the money coming into the foundation after 2003. The organization revealed their net assets to be at $1.7 million in 2004 and $2.3 million in 2005 compared to just over $144,000 in 2003.<o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It is impossible to identify who is contributing to a nonprofit like the Ted Stevens Foundation. The part of the 990 available for public inspection discloses information on the various disbursements made by a nonprofit during an accounting year, but does not disclose names of donors.</p>
The 990 forms for the Ted Stevens Foundation report that the foundation was set up Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºto assist in educating and informing the public about the career of Senator Ted Stevens, to make grants to other public charities and to provide programs which educate, encourage communication, relieve poverty and promote community welfare throughout the state of Alaska and the United States.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Between 2003 and 2005 the foundation has spent more than $380,000 on fundraisers but has given out only two grants: one for $40,000 to the Smithsonian Institute in 2004 and $10,000 to the Anchorage Rowing Association in 2005, according to the 990s.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In December 2006 the <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/ted-stevens_name-change.pdf"">Ted Stevens Foundation changed its name</a> to the North to the Future Foundation, this time its namesake being <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:state w:st=""on"">Alaska</st1:state></st1:place>'s motto, according documents filed with the Alaskan Department of Commerce. In the same year they also filed a <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/agent-change.pdf"">change of leadership</a>, with Tim McKeever handing over the reigns to Edith Opinsky. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºI am not involved in the Northern Lights PAC but I understand that it is legal for a PAC to donate to a charity... [Sen. Stevens] has no role in the activities of the foundation, has no say in what it does, the donations it makes and the like,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ McKeever wrote in response to our questions. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">McKeever is an attorney with Holmes, Weddle &amp; Barcott, a law firm in <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:state w:st=""on"">Alaska</st1:state></st1:place> and was a registered lobbyist until 2006.

Pete Visclosky, one of the most prolific recipients of campaign cash from and earmarker of federal dollars to PMA Group clients, had requested no earmarks--not a single one--for former clients of the firm for fiscal year FY 2010. Oddly enough, employees and PACs of former PMA Group clients donated <a href=""http://thehill.com/business--lobby/visclosky-donation-list-clear-of-pma-firms-2009-04-15.html"">nothing</a> to Visclosky's reelection campaign in the first quarter of 2009, according to Roxana Tiron of the Hill.

Chris Dodd's fundraising efforts for his reelection bid, and his tendency to raise it from interests with business before his committee: 

<blockquote>The special interest cash leaves Dodd vulnerable to charges that he's too cozy with the very people he's supposed to regulate, the same crowd many blame for the financial meltdown. It's a problem lawmakers who rely on Wall Street campaign cash face as Congress tackles a sweeping financial regulation overhaul.

One of the country's wealthiest hedge fund managers, John Paulson, recently hosted a New York fundraiser for Dodd. The event came as the banking panel considers whether new regulations are needed for hedge funds, the vast pools of capital that largely escape government supervision.</blockquote>

So do hedge fund managers hosting fund raisers for banking committee chairmen bring up hedge fund regulations?

<blockquote>Embattled Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) is bringing back a former chief of staff in hopes of bolstering his regulatory record as he battles for his political career.

Edward Silverman will become chief of staff for the Senate Banking Committee, according to several lobbyists close to the committee. Silverman currently heads public policy for Connecticut-Ã‚Â­based firm RBS Securities and serves as treasurer of DoddÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leadership political action committee. The Banking Committee declined to comment on the hire.</blockquote>

A few thoughts: Earmark season (why do I imagine a lobbyist dressed up like Elmer Fudd?) comes early in the year--requests had to be submitted to members by April 3 in the House; for the Senate they'll start rolling in at the end of this month. So the prime fundraising season for Appropriators (who decide which of those requests will end up in the final versions of the spending bills) may actually be in the next quarter. While Political Party Time doesn't have a complete set of fundraiser invitations by any means, assuming the sample we do get remains consistent, it will be interesting to see if there are more fundraisers in the second three months of 2009 than the first.

947	Still waiting for FOIA reforms to surface	still-waiting-for-foia-reforms-to-surface	2	"Roger Strother <a href=""http://www.ombwatch.org/node/9931"">writes</a> at OMB Watch's Fine Print blog about the latest noise coming out of the <a href=""http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/oip.html"">Office of Information Policy</a> about the ""sea change in the way transparency is viewed across the government."" That sea change is supposed to lift a lot of FOIA requests that, unlike boats, seem to sink the bottom with incredible rapidity, then burrow down into the muck at the bottom. We've found that the only way to surface those FOIA requests is the application of vigorous effort (including regularly calling FOIA officers to make sure they haven't forgotten us). Waiting--for months or years at a time--is also a necessary skill to master. In any case, Roger notes:

<blockquote>We are still waiting for agencies to begin acting on the proactive disclosure elements of the FOIA guidelines.  One of the Holder memo directions was to Ã¢â‚¬Å“not wait for specific requests from the publicÃ¢â‚¬Â but to act in advance of public requests in releasing information.  The recently released OIP guidance goes further to suggest that agencies implement systems to routinely identify and systematically post such information.</blockquote>

While I'm curious whether people are seeing proactive disclosure from government Web sites, I'm always more interested in how long it takes for government to release the information people <i>are</i> asking for. There's a line about a murder defendant wanting a parade of people who didn't see him strangle the victim to testify on his behalf. I wonder whether proactive disclosures will have that character.

951	The unbearable opacity of TARP: Government agencies can't tell us who's in charge	the-unbearable-opacity-of-tarp-government-agencies-cant-tell-us-whos-in-charge	3	"The new <a href=""http://sigtarp.gov/reports/congress/2009/April2009_Quarterly_Report_to_Congress.pdf"">report</a> to Congress from <a href=""http://www.sigtarp.gov/"">SIGTARP</a> -- the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program -- begins by noting that TARP has evolved into ""12 separate, but often interrelated,
programs involving government and private funds of up to almost $3 trillion"" of an ""unprecedented scope, scale, and complexity."" The report highlighted the possibilities of fraud and conflicts on interest in the bailout process and calls for better disclosure. We continue to find that even some of the most elementary details about the program -- like who is actually managing distribution of the bailout money to financial institutions -- is still shrouded in secrecy.

At Sunlight weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been contacting the agencies responsible for reviewing applications for TARP funds made by banks including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Thrift Supervision and the and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency to provide us a list of people involved in deciding which bank gets how much money under TARP. In <a href=""http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/04/10/who%E2%80%99s-manning-the-tarp-desk/"">""Who's Manning the TARP Desk""</a>, we documented the process bank regulators follow while deciding if a bank should get bailout money, and identified the officials--all holdovers from the Bush administration--who make the final decisions on disbursing TARP funds at Treasury. But they rely on analysis that come from the FDIC, OTC and the OCC. So we contacted those agencies to find out who does those reviews.

At first the FDICÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s press spokesperson refused giving out names of the people involved, telling us, ""There is no list of people that makes the decision, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made by the applications department."" Then they asked us to make a Freedom of Information Act request, which we did.

In answer to the FOIA, Sunlight received an email that might best be described as a hedged response. The email contained about 20 bios with a caveat: ""[W]hile it is assumed that some of these persons may participate in the oversight or coordination of some of the FDIC's activities with respect to 'TARP,' we have not confirmed and are not representing that all of these persons did, in fact, review, oversee or coordinate all of any of the applications about which your initial request pertains."" According to the FOIA officer, this information is not traditionally disclosed. They also noted that, under FOIA rules, they are not obligated to create lists (or documents or reports or anything else) -- only to release documents that already exist. Apparently the FDIC maintains no list of people authorized to review applications from banks requesting TARP funds.

As to the series of bios that the FDIC put together for us: a handful of the employees (who may or may not have something to do with TARP) come from banking firms or have worked on Capitol Hill as staffers for committees that oversee the banking industry. Sandra Thompson, Director of FDICÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection, worked with Goldman Sachs as an associate before moving to work with the FDIC. Martin Gruenberg, Vice Chairman, FDIC, served as Senior Counsel for Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., and on the staff of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Gruenberg's work on legislation included Sarbanes-Oxley, a bill that required more corporate accountability in the wake of the Enron scandal.

The FDIC was actually more forthcoming with information than other agencies that review bank applications for TARP funds. For example, the one person I was able to contact at OTS (by no means the only person I tried to contact) agreed to speak, strictly on background, about the process and detailed information that banks have to submit, but declined to name people involved and said that most of the decisions were made by ""senior management.""

Meanwhile, the composition of the TARP Investment Committee -- the body at Treasury that makes final determinations on TARP funds -- is changing. The Obama administration <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/13/AR2009041303257.html"">appointed</a> Herbert M. Allison Jr. -- who ran Fannie Mae for the Bush administration after the government seized the troubled institution in 2008 -- to replace Neel Kashkari as assistant secretary for financial stability. Kashkari has been in that position since November 2008.

Several of our calls and e-mails to TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s press offices remain unanswered and according to their Web site several of the positions in the public affairs office are still <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/offices/public-affairs/keypersonnel.shtml"">vacant</a>. During one of my myriad attempts to get someone with the Office of Financial Stability to speak to, one of the operators said, ""thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no office yet, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only a Web site."" And surely enough six months after the office was set up the <a href=""http://www.financialstability.gov/contact/index.html"">Web site</a> doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t list any contact phone number but directs calls to TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s press office."		2009-04-28 16:32:11	2009-04-28 16:32:11	2009-04-28 16:32:11	1	0	1

Ron Moore, <a href=""http://talkingunion.wordpress.com/2009/03/26/specter-took-250k-from-union-buster-in-2008-then-turned-back-on-workers/"">writing</a> at a labor union site, notes that Specter's <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=Career&type=I&cid=N00001604&newMem=N&recs=20"">top career donor</a> is the law firm of <a href=""http://www.blankrome.com/"">Blank Rome LLP</a>, which has a fairly broad-based practice which includes everything from lobbying for the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Knik+Arm+Bridge+%26+Toll+Authority&year=2009"">Knik Arm Bridge and Toll Authority</a> (which would toll and have its authority respected over one of the Alaskan bridges to nowhere), representing parties before the <a href=""http://www.blankrome.com/index.cfm?contentID=43&itemID=96"">International Trade Commission</a>, closing local <a href=""http://www.blankrome.com/index.cfm?contentID=43&itemID=295"">real estate deals</a>, advising <a href=""http://www.blankrome.com/index.cfm?contentID=43&itemID=298"">health care information technology firms</a> on securing venture capital, and representing a <a href=""http://fara.sunlightfoundation.com/registrant/Blank%20Rome%20LLP/"">foreign government</a>. While it's probably unfair to characterize Blank Rome LLP as a ""union busting law firm,"" they do <a href=""http://www.blankrome.com/index.cfm?contentID=14&itemID=39"">list</a> union avoidance as one of the services their specialists in employment law offer. 

Will Specter buck his top contributor on card check? In fairness, it's entirely possible that passing card check could end up meaning booming business for Blank Rome LLP -- from the <a href=""http://www.blankrome.com/index.cfm?contentID=37&itemID=1779"">above linked Blank Rome newsletter</a>:

<blockquote>Blank Rome Government Relations professionals and members of the Employment, Benefits and Labor group are monitoring developments on this issue closely.  We are available to assist both existing and potential clients with an understanding as to how the Employee Free Choice Act may affect your company and its business objectives.</blockquote>

Will union PACs get out their checkbooks for Specter? Will Specter need their money (he's got a pretty hefty <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary2010.php?type=I&cid=N00001604&newMem=N"">$6.7 million</a> in the bank). And how long will we have to wait until Senate campaigns <a href=""http://sunlightfoundation.com/pass482/"">digitally file</a> their campaign finance reports, so I can answer such questions without wading through 583 pages of raw filings at the FEC Web site?"		2009-04-30 20:12:59	2009-04-30 20:12:59	2009-04-30 20:12:59	1	0	1
972	Congress' family business, Chris Dodd edition	congress-family-business-chris-dodd-edition	2	"Edmund H. Mahony and Jon Lender of the the Hartford Courant <a href=""http://www.courant.com/news/politics/hc-jackie-clegg-dodd-0503.artmay03,0,4153099.story"">report</a> on Sen. Christopher Dodd's wife:

<blockquote>Since the low-profile family wedding on a rise above the Connecticut River in 1999, Jackie M. Clegg Dodd's income has quadrupled to the mid-six-figure range. All of the increase is due to her appointment as a highly compensated member of multiple corporate boards of directors.

Clegg Dodd, a former legislative aide and senior federal Export-Import Bank officer, was compensated at a rate of about $500,000 a year in 2007 and 2008 from seats on five corporate boards, according to the most recent filings by the companies to the federal Securities and Exchange Commission.</blockquote>

The first thing I think is: How many other congressional spouses have been added to boards of public and closely-held companies as their elected halves enter Congress or move up in the hierarchy? I'm guessing Dodd's wife isn't the only spouse so situated."		2009-05-04 16:02:03	2009-05-04 16:02:03	2009-05-04 16:02:03	1	0	1
974	Roll Call makes PMA Group articles available online	roll-call-makes-pma-group-articles-available-online	2	"In conjunction with the <a href=""http://www.c-span.org/Watch/Media/2009/05/04/WJE/R/18151/Monday+May+5.aspx"">appearance</a> of Paul Singer on C-Span's Washington Journal this morning (his bit starts about 1:03:30 in on the video), Roll Call has put online its <a href=""http://www.rollcall.com/news/pma.html"">amazing body</a> of work tracking the PMA Group, the defunct lobbying firm under federal investigation that, along with its clients, provided <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/03/pma-group-and-clients-paid-out.html"">oodles of campaign cash</a> to more than 100 members of the House while securing hundreds of millions in earmarks for its clients. 

Of all the stories there, <a href=""http://www.rollcall.com/issues/54_103/news/33201-1.html"">this one</a>, from March 17, still strikes me as the most interesting: 

<blockquote>...top PMA officials also had financial stakes in several of the companies that PMA was helping to obtain earmarks. ...

... on background, several sources agreed that it is unusual but not unheard of for lobbying firms to have ownership stake in clients that they represent. Some firms take an equity stake as part of their payment for representing the client, sources said, and there is no conflict of interest because what is good for the client is then also good for the lobbyist.</blockquote>

I'm curious to know more about what other investments PMA Group lobbyists had in their clients, whether equity was taken in lieu of lobbying fees (how exactly does one calculate the value of that for purposes of disclosing payments under the Lobbying Disclosure Act?), and to what extent lobbyists at other firms have done the same thing.

976	Looking up cram down opponents in Party Time	looking-up-cram-down-opponents-in-party-time	2	"This post is all research and no results -- that'll come later. I wanted to take a look at a vote my colleague Paul Blumenthal <a href=""http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/04/30/they-frankly-own-the-place/"">referred to</a> with the title (quoting Sen. Richard Durbin) ""They own the place."" The ""they"" in question are financial sector firms, the place is Congress; at issue is a bill, the <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s896/show"">Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009</a> -- or rather, an <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/articles/view/965-Durbin-s-Cramdown-Amendment"">amendment</a> to that bill -- that was voted down by a 51-45 margin.

The <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/articles/view/965-Durbin-s-Cramdown-Amendment"">Durbin amendment</a>, also known as the <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/30/mortgages-cramdowns-senate-business-cramdown.html"">cram down bill</a>, would have removed the mortgage exemption from bankruptcy proceedings, allowing bankruptcy judges some leeway to rewrite the terms of mortgages which in turn might prevent a lot of foreclosures. It's fairly clear that Wall Street opposed the measure (<a href=""http://www.fsround.org/policy/pstatements/pdfs/Bankruptcy_JointSenateLetter_042909.pdf"">here's</a> a letter from a bunch of financial industry, business and Wall Street trade groups that begins, ""The undersigned organizations are strongly opposed to a bankruptcy cram down amendment that is likely to be offered by Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL) to S. 896...""). 

Sadly, what we find out about the industry's efforts to influence members of Congress we only discover in retrospect. To go back to the Durbin amendment: The vote was on April 30, which falls squarely in the second quarter of 2009, so we won't see campaign contributions and lobbying activity until after the quarter ends. (Lobbying filings for the second quarter are due on July 20, 2009; campaigns file their contribution records on July 15, 2009). So the gaggles of lobbyists disclosing an interest in the bill won't turn up til later; neither will the PAC contributions or the bundles of individual contributions from interests that opposed the bill. 

So, I'm going to run the <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/roll_call/show/5519"">nay voters</a>, in alphabetical order, through <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org"">Party Time</a> to see what turns up. Did lobbyists and PACs of interests opposed to the cram down host fundraisers for members of Congress around the time of the vote? Some caveats, of course, are in order: Party Time, sadly, is not a complete database of fundraisers. Some of those fundraisers for which we do have information list hosts who can be tied to specific interests, but many of them list no host, or the hosts are lobbyists who represent many clients. Then again, just because agricultural interests are hosting a fundraiser for a member doesn't mean that employees or lobbyists of a financial institution can't show up. And, of course, two-thirds of our senators aren't in campaign mode -- they don't face voters again until 2012 or 2014 -- so we might not see fundraisers for them. Like many of the things we do, we're starting by saying, <i>we have no idea what value this adds, but it seems worth playing with a while to see what falls out.</i>

In addition to Party Time, I'm also going to check <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org"">OpenSecrets.org</a>, the <a href=""http://www.fec.gov"">FEC site</a> and the <a href=""http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=chooseFields"">Senate Office of Public Records lobbying database</a> to see what turns up there--again, none of those filings will cover the weeks leading up to the April 30 vote or its aftermath, but perhaps we can find a few clues there.

That said, let's take a look and see what we can see. I'll be fumbling through this the next couple of days or so, doing ten or so members at a time. Here's the first batch...

<strong>Sen. Lamar Alexander:</strong> Nothing in 2009. He's not up for reelection until 2014. He's raised all of $5,684 in the first quarter of 2009.
<strong>Sen. John Barrasso:</strong> Though he's not up for <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary2010.php?type=I&amp;cid=N00006236&amp;newMem=N"">reelection til 2014</a>, he's had a pair of fundraisers 2009. On March 12 he <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/party/10211/"">raised money</a> for his leadership PAC, Wyoming values. I took a look at the FEC's site, and they currently have <a href=""http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00442368"">no 2009 info</a> posted for the PAC -- worth keeping an eye on. Barrasso also had a fundraiser for his own reelection committee on <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/party/10208/"">March 5</a> hosted by Louis DuPart. There's a Louis DuPart who, according to <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org"">Open Secrets</a>, went through the <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=15882"">revolving door</a> and now represents <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lobbyist.php?year=2009&amp;ype=l&amp;lname=Dupart%2C+Louis+H&amp;id=Y00000200570"">a bunch of clients</a> -- not sure though whether the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame has a position on cram downs.
<strong>Sen. Max Baucus</strong> is the politician you want to contribute to if you're into <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Beneficiary/baucus/"">snow mobiling, fishing, camping or golf</a>. At three of the four events he's hosted or will host in 2009, Baucus is raising money for his leadership PAC, the Glacier PAC; sadly, the FEC has <a href=""http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00353953"">no info</a> on 2009 contributions. Baucus also raised, in the first quarter of 2009, <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary2010.php?type=I&amp;cid=N00004643&amp;newMem=N"">$216,534</a> for his campaign committee. The contributions can be accessed <a href=""http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00328211"">here</a> in a nonsearchable format -- I flipped through the first couple of pages and saw a lot of contributions from employees of Patton Boggs.
<strong>Sen. Michael Bennett:</strong> Has <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Beneficiary/Michael%20Bennett/"">three fundraisers</a> in 2009. One <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/party/8409/"">hosted</a> by (and at the offices of) law and lobbying firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, which represents, among <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?lname=Akin%2C+Gump+et+al&amp;year=2009"">others</a>, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which <a href=""http://www.fsround.org/policy/pstatements/pdfs/Bankruptcy_JointSenateLetter_042909.pdf"">opposes</a> the bill. Akin Gump didn't list it though among their <a href=""http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=ed97e761-6156-4f33-b138-ddfb3273de0b"">lobbying issues</a> in the first quarter of 2009; it will be worth looking it up in the second quarter though. Tony Podesta hosted another fundraiser for Bennett; he <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lobbyist.php?lname=Podesta%2C+Anthony&amp;id=U00000022361&amp;year=2009"">represents, among others</a>, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; again, worth checking that lobbying disclosure form in July...
<strong>Sen. Bob Bennett:</strong> Okay, <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Beneficiary/Bob%20Bennett/"">lots</a> to look at. We have ten fundraisers in 2009 -- Bennett's raising money for his 2010 reelection bid -- <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary2010.php?type=I&amp;cid=N00006347&amp;newMem=N"">$474,675</a> in the first quarter. I'd love to know who showed up at his <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/party/9983/"">April 29 fundraiser</a> which featured special guest Sen. Thad Cochran. The <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/party/11182/"">May 6 fundraiser</a> looks like it's being hosted by phone company lobbyists, while the <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/party/9383/"">April 11 breakfast</a> looks like it's been hosted by a group of lobbyists who represent health care (and other) interests--one of the hosts appears to be a <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=26732"">former Bennett staffer</a>.
<b>Sen. Christopher Bond</b>: Had an <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/party/8788/"">April 21 fundraiser. Bond is stepping down when his term ends in 2010 (thanks to Paul Blumenthal for the correction). On <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary2010.php?type=I&cid=N00005178&newMem=N"">2010</a>, and raised $14,317 in the first quarter, according to Open Secrets. His leadership PAC hasn't reported any contributions in 2009, according to the <a href=""http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00410357"">FEC</a>.
<b>Sen. Sam Brownback</b>: His term expires in 2010, and he's not seeking reelection.
<b>Sen. Jim Bunning</b>: No fundraisers for Bunning in 2009 from Party Time's database (of course, as noted above, that doesn't mean he didn't have any--just that our sources didn't get invited to any). Bunning raised <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary2010.php?type=I&cid=N00003437&newMem=N"">$262,980</a> in the first quarter of 2009. 
<b>Sen. Richard Burr</b>: A whopping <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Beneficiary/Richard%20Burr/"">13 fundraisers</a> in 2009; up for reelection in 2010, Burr raised <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary2010.php?type=I&cid=N00002221&newMem=N"">$702,600</a> in the first quarter. Note the <a href=""http://politicalpartytime.org/party/10788/"">April 22 fundraiser</a> hosted by the U.S. Chamber PAC -- the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is one of the opponents of the bill. 
<b>Sen. Robert Byrd</b>: Nothing in Party Time's database. Byrd isn't up for reelection until 2012.

981	Congress' family business, John Murtha edition	congress-family-business-john-murtha-edition	2	"From the &lt;a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/04/AR2009050403743.html?hpid=topnews""&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The headquarters of Murtech, in a low-slung, bland building in a Glen Burnie business park, has its blinds drawn tight and few signs of life. On several days of visits, a handful of cars sit in the parking lot, and no trucks arrive at the 10 loading bays at the back of the building.
<div id=""body_after_content_column"">

Yet last year, Murtech received $4 million in Pentagon work, all of it without competition, for a variety of warehousing and engineering services. With its long corridor of sparsely occupied offices and an unmanned reception area, Murtech's most striking feature is its owner -- Robert C. Murtha Jr., 49. He's the nephew of Rep. John P. Murtha, the Pennsylvania Democrat who has significant sway over the Defense Department's spending as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee.</div>
Robert Murtha said he is not at liberty to discuss in detail what his company does, but for four years it has subsisted on defense contracts, according to records and interviews. He said Murtech's 17 employees ""provide necessary logistical support"" to Pentagon testing programs that focus on detecting chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats, ""and that's about as far as I feel comfortable going."" Giving more details could give important clues to terrorist plotters, he said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There's more:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Murtha's power has had beneficial effects within his family. His brother, Robert C. ""Kit"" Murtha, built a longtime lobbying practice around clients seeking defense funds through the Appropriations Committee and became one of the top members of KSA, a lobbying firm whose contractor clients often received multimillion-dollar earmarks directed through the Appropriations chairman.

Robert C. Murtha Jr. of Murtech is Kit Murtha's son. He also is a former Marine who once served as a presidential security officer and aide to the president for White House functions. He worked for eight years for ACS, a defense and information technology contractor. When Lockheed purchased ACS in 2004, he started several companies, including Murtech, which he registered as a defense contracting firm.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
