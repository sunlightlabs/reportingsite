    <h2>
        Fundraising and spending by political leaning, 2011-12
    </h2>
<p class="tip">Totals on this page reflect money raised by super PACs, and money spent by super PACS, noncommittees and party committees in the 2012 election cycle. For a more complete accounting, see the <a href="/outside-spending/overview/">outside spending overview page</a>. Also see a breakdown of <a href="/outside-spending/by-spending/">spending by office sought</a>.</p>
<p><b>Sunlight researchers determined the political orientation of political groups by reviewing spending and public communications patterns. We are including a "political orientation" column in <a href="/outside-spending/csv/superpac-political-orientation/">our downloadable .csv file summarizing committee financials</a>. For more details, see our <a href="http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/super-pac/data/about/2012-june-update/#political_orientation">methodology</a>.</b></p>

<br><span class="amountLine">Cash on hand, all other Super PACs: </span><span class="amount">${{oth_coh|floatformat:0|intcomma}}</span>
<p>Cash on hand reflects the balance as of each super PACs most recent filing. Some file reports monthly: They are due on the 20th of each month. Some file quarterly. Those statements are due on the 15th of the month following the close of the quarter. Note that quarterly filers also have to file pre- and post-election reports, timed to the primary and general election dates.</p>
