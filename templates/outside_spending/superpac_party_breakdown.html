    <h2>
        Super PAC spending and fundraising by political orientation, 2011-12
    </h2>
<p class="tip">Totals on this page only reflect money raised and spent by Super PACs, which only reflect a part of the outside spending picture. For a more complete picture see the <a href="/outside-spending/overview/">outside spending overview page</a>.</p>
<p><b>Political orientation as used on this page is determined by researchers at The Sunlight Foundation based on a review of spending patterns and public communications--it does not reflect any official designation. In general, a conservative approach was used; if a PAC didn't fit neatly into party labels a label has not been applied. For more information see <a href="">the methodology</a>. The categorization currently used is available in the 'political orientation' column of <a href="/outside-spending/csv/superpac-political-orientation/">a downloadable csv file summarizing Super PACs.</a></b></p>

<br><span class="amountLine">Cash on hand, all other Super PACs: </span><span class="amount">$XXX,XXX</span>
<p>Cash on hand is as of each Super PAC's most recent filing. Monthly filers usually file on the 20th of each month; quarterly filings are due on the 15th of the month following the close of the quarter. Note that quarterly filers also have to file pre- and post- election reports aligned to the primary and general election calendar they are trying to influence.</p>
