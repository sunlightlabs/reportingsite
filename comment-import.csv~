24,18,120,"",17,"A Watcher","trmcdowell@yahoo.com","","My post which you kindly quoted above was probably misleading.

I wouldn't want you or your readers to put the three Udall related subpoenas out of your minds based on that one post.  In fact, I think what happened needs very close examination.  

It appears to me that Udall and his staff set the woman up to make Udall look moderate.  Think Sister Souljah.  

I'm a retired Army officer and would normally take Udall's side when anti-war activists occupied his office for three weeks, and did.   Then I discovered that while Udall's staff testified at her trial that she had interfered with their operation for three weeks, she and the staff had agreed beforehand what form the demonstration would take.  

She had followed that agreement until the last day when she announced that she would commit an act of civil disobedience.  She was allowed to stay for 10 minutes under the agreement, and as soon as she went over, Udall's staff called the cops.

Udall got subpoenaed, but asked the judge to quash it, which he did.  That might seem reasonable except that the judge then sentenced the woman to a year in jail, 330 days suspended and a $1,000 fine, half suspended.   My view is that a judge who is considering that kind of sentence has an obligation to let the defendant present her witnesses, even if they are Congressmen.  It would be very surprising if he didn't know of and approve of his staff's actions during a 3 week demonstration.

If a Republican congressman had pulled half of this, the Denver Post would be all over it.  Udall got special treatment.  The Post reported her sentence as a ""month"" in jail and a $500 fine.  It was careful not to write about the agreement and what the actual violation was.  

It took about a month for me to piece this story together because of the outright deceptive reporting.   I have written about what I found in two different blogs.  Recently a self described ""lefty"" left a comment gleefully observing that no one was paying attention.  He's right.

In any event, my intent with my short post which you linked to was to identify the probable source of the subpoenas, not absolve Mark Udall of wrongdoing.  I think the ethics committee should be looking into this.  It smells.

Later this evening, I will add another comment with links to a few posts I have written on it, assuming your site allows links.","2007-09-21 22:09:58","75.71.200.86"

Anu and I had looked into this ourselves. We didn't posted anything on it, but we did find some of the same overlap as Next Right did. One of Obama's bundlers identified by Public Citizen as a <a href=""http://action.citizen.org/content.jsp?content_KEY=3741&t=WhiteHouseForSale.dwt"" rel=""nofollow"">former lobbyist</a>, Frank Clark, turns up on the board of a few nonprofits for which Obama secured earmarks. <a href=""http://www.exeloncorp.com/aboutus/management/"" rel=""nofollow"">This page</a> lists some: ""Clark serves on the board of trustees of the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum, DePaul University, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, University of Chicago Medical Center, and The Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum.  He also is on the board of directors of Metropolitan Family Services, Governors State University Foundation, Illinois Manufacturers Association, Big Shoulders Fund, United Way of Metropolitan Chicago, the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation and the executive committee of The Chicago Community Trust."" Adler Planetarium got an earmark from Obama--can't recall which of the others did without my notes, but <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/11/AR2007101101573.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here's a list</a> from the Washington Post -- you can look for others yourself. 

So contra Connie and Anon, we did check this out ourselves. And prior to the posting on Next Right, I spoke to two reporters from main stream outlets who were looking into this, independently of one another, to see what I thought, and I pretty much said the same thing--that lawmakers end up knowing their districts or states not always through firsthand experience but rather through the eyes of their big contributors and lobbyists.

As for McCain, he doesn't ask for earmarks--at least not since earmark disclosure required Senators to be identified along with their earmarks. We have posted on McCain though.

Finally, if you're going to argue we can't link to any source that might have a partisan edge, that's going to eliminate a whole lot of the blogosphere, and I'm not willing to do that. 99 44/100s percent of campaign coverage and analysis from mainstream reporters will come from talking to partisans and folks with an axe of one kind or another to grind.

Also, if I read the House/Senate rules about lobbying reports correctly, the reporting person has to round up to the next $20,000 every 6 months.  So if someone reports $40K a year, that means the fees could be anything from the $10K threshold to $20K.  I seem to remember that our local paper said the city paid $2000 a month for the lobbyist, and it has received at least several million dollars back over the time period to which you refer.  (I wish my county would hire the same person!)
Maybe it's just me, but I would rather my congressman make decisions about how to spend our money than some beaurocrat in Washington.  At least I get to vote for, or against, the congressman if I dont like what they do.  I think y'all are off target on this earmark thing.","2008-02-24 00:34:29","24.96.179.85"
785,18,145,"",0,"Angela","ronandangie@gmail.com","","With the increase in the number of earmarks from Congress, maybe someone should evaluate â€šÃ„Ãºwhyâ€šÃ„Ã¹ there has been an increase instead of just labeling them as â€šÃ„Ãºbad.â€šÃ„Ã¹

First, a little perspective: 

The total amount of money â€šÃ„Ãºearmarkedâ€šÃ„Ã¹ for particular uses is a very small percentage of the overall federal spending each year â€šÃ„Ã¬ one percent or less.  To equate earmarking of federal dollars to out-of-control spending is not factually supported, and even if you wiped out every single earmark (begging the question of what an â€šÃ„Ãºearmarkâ€šÃ„Ã¹ really is) the financial impact upon the country would likely be unfelt.  If you doubt this, take a look at the FY2007 continuing resolution, which knocked out most earmarks.  Did anyone really notice?

The earmarks scrutinized by â€šÃ„ÃºTaxpayers For Common Sense,â€šÃ„Ã¹ the Sunshine Foundation, and others are all contained in appropriation spending bills.  They do not impact the total amount of funds spent, just where and how they are spent.  Think of it this way â€šÃ„Ã¬ during the budgeting process, Congress decides how big a pie to make. They decide how much of an ingredient to put in the pie (tax revenue) and when they finally pass a budget, itâ€šÃ„Ã´s like putting it in the oven to bake.  But once the pie is removed from the oven, they have to decide how to cut the pie and to whom it should be served.  Thatâ€šÃ„Ã´s the appropriation process.  Earmarking a piece of the pie in no way impacts the size of a pie already baked.  

Earmarking is part of a constitutionally directed responsibility of the Congress; it decides where money should be spent.   Isnâ€šÃ„Ã´t it ironic that no one complains about the President, Vice President, or executive agencies earmarking federal dollars?  Do we really feel so much more comfortable with bureaucrats who do not stand for election, or in the case of the president and vice-president, do so a maximum of two elections in eight years, having the sole ability to decide where money should be spent?  Or would we rather have 435 elected congressmen having to answer for their decisions every two years, and another 100 senators every six years?

So why do earmarks appear more popular?  

The bureaucratic process of utilizing federal resources is daunting.  The cost of applying for funding and the costs that are required to be incurred without any indication of the likelihood of success requires communities and other potentially worthy applicants to undertake significant financial risk.  Those persons, organizations, and communities most in need and often the most worthy, are also often the least able to afford the costs and risks the system has come to mean.  When that happens, who could blame a potential applicant from turning to the person or persons elected to helping them in our government?

Recipients of earmarked appropriations do not get a free pass.  The applicant is still required to meet program requirements and fit the legally mandated criteria.  The difference however, is that with an earmark designation in an appropriation bill, the applicant knows that its up front costs â€šÃ„Ã¬ planning, engineering, consulting, etc. â€šÃ„Ã¬ will be utilized and that the cost will not be wasted.  In short, the earmark lowers the risk of wasting time and resources to obtain the requested funding.  Lowering that risk gives smaller and less affluent communities and non-profit organizations the ability to invest their limited resources more intelligently.

Congressional representatives can serve as a single point of contact for a constituentâ€šÃ„Ã´s needs.  The federal government â€šÃ„Ã¬ rightly or wrongly â€šÃ„Ã¬ is huge, complex, and complicated.  There are many agencies and programs, often with overlapping jurisdictions and authority.  Unless one is knowledgeable about a particular program or resource, it is often difficult to know where to start.  Congressional staffs help serve as a clearing house of resources for communities seeking help.  For example, the community seeking help to revitalize its town, develop small business, and create new jobs, might find it interesting that the Department of Transportation, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Department of Commerce all may have programs to help -- but where to start?  Congressional offices can serve as that starting place.

More, not less, congressional involvement is needed to address the countryâ€šÃ„Ã´s overall spending habits.  Removing congress from the spending process also removes them further from accountability to each of us, the voters.  Alternatively, expecting members of congress to be more involved with the real consequences of their spending decisions puts some context on the votes for large number spending bills that may or may not mean anything to their own districts. 

A word about transparency.  Taxpayers For Common Sense, the Sunlight Foundation, and other media sources focused upon congressional spending should be applauded for helping to shine light on how our tax dollars are spent.  Indeed, one day perhaps Congress itself will make review of their spending decisions more easily done.  Until that day, however, the media continues to play an important, and at time singular, role as congressional watchdog.   Faith in the publicâ€šÃ„Ã´s ability to form its own conclusions about each transaction, assuming it has adequate information about the transaction, is made easier with greater transparency with the earmark process.  To pass judgment on the process itself, because of its misuse by some, however, is to declare the media efforts to improve that transparency a failure.","2008-02-24 02:40:54","24.96.179.85"

With earmarks generally, what interests me is the question of access, and the price of admission. There are all kinds of competing needs in any congressional district -- plenty of worthy projects. How do lawmakers--who say they know their districts--find out about them? Is it from personal knowledge, or is it because they bump into a paid lobbyist at a fund-raising event who says, ""Hey, we could really use some help with road improvement in Atmore.""

Here's your chance to help figure out who has been lobbying the White House during the early months of the Obama administration.

Details are at msnbc.com:

Help figure out who has been calling on Obama

A guessing game: Who visited White House in administration's early days?

Although President Barack Obama  has announced that he will make public the names of most visitors to the White House, there's a catch.

Under the new White House policy, names of visitors during the first eight months of the administration are not being released wholesale. Those visitors will be revealed only if a member of the public requests specific names to be checked against the visitor logs. 

It's a guessing game. The White House rules don't allow you to ask for ""everyone who visited on Feb. 3,"" or ""anyone who visited green jobs czar Van Jones ,"" but you can ask for all visits by specific people, whether former Sen. Tom Daschle or New York Times columnist David Brooks or an Obama campaign donor from your hometown.

I don't know about the rest of you, but I am tired of the Washington culture club.  It does not take someone of long tenure in the government to be leveheaded and be able to select qualified people to advise her.  It took Obama three tries to give a somewhat acceptable response to Russia's invasion of Georgia - evidently his foreign policy advisors did not know that going to the UN  would be useless - since Russia could VETO that action.  And, Joe Biden has yet to get a foreign policy issue right!

Besting three other local teams, Berkeley’s ELS and London’s Foster + Partners got the nod for one of the largest stimulus-bill projects to date in San Francisco: the $121 million renovation of 50 UN Plaza, a historic federal building in the Civic Center area.

But the General Services Administration (GSA)’s decision has left some scratching their heads. The other three firms on the shortlist—SOM, Architectural Resources Group with HKS, and Hornberger + Worstell with William McDonough—are all based in San Francisco, and the political wisdom of the choice has been a subject of debate since.

Warren alluded to it in his speech at the Democratic convention, but gave it the best possible spin.  He earned his money by speculating in spectrum licenses at the taxpayers' expense.  In the mid-1980s, the FCC allocated licenses by lottery.  Warren was the leading sales promoter who got doctors, dentists, and other high income individuals to submit lottery applications.  In return, Warren got a substantial cut of winning tickets (of which, through the law of large numbers, he had a lot).   In the end, after the licenses were sold to the major telecom players, Warren earned tens of millions of dollars, perhaps hundreds of millions.  The lottery itself was perfectly legal, even if it was a type of welfare for high income individuals at the general public's expense.  The dirty and most noteworthy part of the operation was that all the speculators had to pretend that they really did want to build out mobile telephone operations, when all they genuinely wanted to do was win the license and then flip it to a well heeled telecom company.  This was fraud; it was put in writing on FCC applications; and Warren was the ringleader.","2008-09-03 13:58:33","69.255.163.50"

You've looked into his tax records back to 1978 and found 28 mistakes-- wow!  Bet if you gave the same scrutiny to the Republican side of the aisle, you'd find that number to be minuscule.  Our tax code is not exactly easy.  This whole investigation seems to be motivated and promoted by the Republican side of the aisle who find Representative Rangel too liberal or perhaps a shade too dark to  hold the Chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee-- such power, in their estimation as revealed by the behavior of their leaders, can only be wielded by some crusty old white man with a conservative bent.  Wish you and the Press would investigate that angle.  All my representative seems to be guilty of is not having a good enough accountant or not having a good enough memory or professional help to fill out the disclosure forms correctly (I had to do one once and, believe me, it was daunting-- I finally had to give it over to my husband to do because I had no time to keep track of  our finances).

I've got 2200 pages of evidence and know what I am talking about here.
Social Security got privatized some years ago. My best guess is 1987. 
My proof goes as far back as 1991.
Fidelity Investments is receiving or has received Social Security money in my name since 1991 . They happened to mess up and start sending me proxy notices in 2006.
I am truly the only person in America who has been on Social Security ( disability) , got off because I could work WITH MY DISABILITY, but got sick again with the same illness long after the protective five year rule.
I worked eleven years so I got penalized, like you have never seen before.
For my efforts, I promise I have been severely abused.
But the bottom line is this....
AIG's largest shareholder is FMR, LLC. FMR,LLC owns Fidelity Investments. They also own Community CCRx, my Part D company who has extorted me to remain covered this year. Community CCRx has two of me in their system.
THEN, I have documents that show that my surrendered account became "" activated"" in the INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS OFFICE.
* Think London AIG please.... because FMR,LLC is the single largest shareholder of AIG at 5% or at least 4 billion publicly.
Investigations were stopped across every law enforcement agency out there and I sit here holding a fraudulent Inspector General report. This report was confirmed as fraud by Special Agent Roland Maye on June 13,2008 after I personally telephoned the Inspector General at his desk.
I believe it's pretty reasonable to assume that AIG is holding the full faith and credit of the United States government hostage.
Want proof?
I got it( you have my private email... use it if you're interested please.)
I am telling you that I've heard AIG people say that the older employees have to stay to fix this mess. Well, TARP people have to stay too.
They know where MY BODY is buried and I WANT MY IDENTITY BACK PRONTO&gt;
Fidelity, Community CCRx and SSA created a second me that has  truly due to my screaming and yelling for four years, caused the entire house of cards to fall in.
I got all the details and the time line will floor you.","2009-04-10 20:06:20","70.157.133.190"

This with this veteranâ€™s in-hand documentation could help the 77, e.g., â€œHad some trouble with hearing while working on warm-up crew for F-86 D with very high noise levels.â€ The physicianâ€™s 29 Jan. 54 USAF Cadet Wing Commander washout statement. All flight line personnel at Tyndall AFB, Panama City, FLA. were unprotected and subjected to the  â€œvery high noise levelsâ€. All worked well within a 50 feet radius and were injured in direct disobedience of  the AFR 160-3 required protection. For F-86D personnel it is the then 1952 known certain J47-GE-1 jet-engine injury, i.e., TR pages 68-75, â€œTest Group 10, Date of the Tests: 1952, Test Numbers 62-64"". This is an at 50 feet 158 dB noise level with an 87,381 X. Fifteen (15) of the 77 were repeatedly exposed to a â€œwarm-up crewâ€ 176 dB level of over 699,051 X vs. the AFR 160-3, 95 dB at 59 X! The AMA Family Medical Guide 3d edition, page 365 is the sound pressure multiple (X) source. Its 60 dB â€œNormal conversationâ€ is the base line for the calculated â€œ...sound pressure doubles with an increase of 6 decibelsâ€ 87,381 X to 699,051 X.

The question is not if these 77 unprotected individuals were injured but how badly!

I'm no good at prognostication (I keep picking the Eagles to win the Superbowl), so take this with a football-sized grain of salt, but I suspect Sarah Palin will be a story for a while, and that she'll likely have some measure of influence on politics even if she doesn't run for president in 2012. Whether she ends as a Dan Quayle-type figure, a Republican whose introduction to the media and subsequent bad press doomed him, or as a Ronald Reagan -- someone canny enough to make bad press into an asset -- I think it's way too early to say.

Though it does state that it is a non-connected committee and a non-connected committee is technically a Leadership PAC, but they haven't check it off yet so calling it a Leadership PAC is not correct as of right now. Sarah PAC isn't listed as a leadership PAC on the FEC web site. I agree with the statement above that this article is spinned. I think this is completely one-sided. You mention that donations under $200 are not known but you don't know how many people contributed to her who gave $199 or less it could be more than the donors who gave a larger sum. States such as NY, VA and CT have more money to give, because people generally are more affluent in those states but that doesn't mean people in Alaska don't support her in other monetary ways as well. They may not contribute a vast amount of money but that doesn't mean that they don't support her in other ways. You just looked at her mid-year report online, read the data and made these assumptions and you're making people believe that Alaskans don't support her. I'll argue that she probably shouldn't have left her term as Governor and she should have carried out her duties but we don't know why she left yet. I think she does care about people and she means well, she wasn't really qualified to be Vice President but she does stand true to her conservative beliefs.

It's so odd that conservatives, usually the same ones who helped Bush/Cheney start the Unnecessary Iraq War, fight getting fair taxes from the wealthy.  
THEIR war in fact will require an incredible amount!  By the time we pay back Red China in maybe 30-40 years, Iraq will have cost OVER $ 4 TRILLION, or $ 4,000 BILLIONS, or 4 Million Millions!!$$$$$$$$$$$
That's not counting taking care of many of the 31,000+ US troops seriously wounded, billions for them til about 2090-2100 !!$$$
So the Iraq War alone will cause a hugh tax increase, or sucking it from other Necessary Needs.  I'd like to stick this bill to the Republican Party, from McCain to Rep. Boehner!$
And if you simply look at zfacts.com, or other sites, you'll see that Democrats have done far better when it comes to federal borrowing vs. the GNP.  It's not even close, the GOP is the king of spending and borrowing!

So let's go after all taxes owed by the wealthy, as most of them voted Republican anyway.  Just like the sports stadium owners, mostly Republican and yet they force barely making it taxpayers to pay for them!  Sick !

I think we all think it's a good thing that the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board posted the contract online -- it's a huge step forward.

""What is clear is that the complaints process is, on its face, designed to protect one contractor from a corrupt or incompetent competitor, government agency or both, and that it’s also one of the layers of red tape that often mar contracting’s reputation, inflating costs and extending deadlines.""

Losing bidders would be debriefed on why they did not win and, therefore, would be able to protest -- a recent change to task orders under multiple-award contracts. How does that mar the reputation of the government contracting process? Just asking...

Also... you highlight Government Executive's coverage. While GovExec has done a very good job on this story, I would note that the Recovery and Transparency Board spoke first on Federal News Radio 1500 AM. We also spoke to GSA's David Drabkin on Friday.

I recently posted about the real issues behind the Recovery.gov contract...

It is important to note that the US federal contracting system is one of the most transparent in the world. That being said, half of government buys are going through multiple-award contracts -- and there is not enough transparency in that process yet.

From the contemporaneous reporting on the stimulus, we learn that the Obama administration was fiercely opposed to Dodd's amendment, which was approved by voice vote, and sought to water it down in conference, which Dodd would not be privy to, as he was not a conferee. 

The origin of this provision is likely, as Jane Hamsher points out, Geithner and the Obama economic team. Considering that Geithner and Summers were fiercely opposed to enacting retroactive caps on compensation and bonuses. Dodd included retroactive caps in his original amendment. Who took part in conference negotiations? Geithner and Obama team. Dodd wasn't a conferee. Now perhaps anyone could have put it in, but through my deductive powers it seems as though one group was in favor of retroactivity (Dodd) and one was opposed (Obama, et al). The opposition won.

I'm aware of millions in missing/unaccounted for funds from exploited elders in Illinois (over $3 million in just two cases, which courts appear to be covering up and which even ProPublica won't touch).

There is at least one bogus corporation plus out-of-country ""financial management"" firms involved.  Complex shell-game transactions have been tracked, some timed to the minute, but courts (Cook County Probate especially) refuse to press alleged perps or impose sanctions for failing to comply with orders to provide lawfully-required information - i.e., a blind eye to the ongoing damage to victims.  FBI and State's Attorney were hot on the trail - until visited by somebody with ties to the Chicago Police Dept.  Then they just stopped.

Where's the money going?  Laundering is suspected, and the large number of Corps using just one Cayman address is odd.  If the list could be searched, it might show a pattern and perhaps help identify court corruption (I'm not alleging that, though I'm not discounting it either) and the sink for exploited funds.

Not hard to do a search for elected politicians disclosures now online. I've see many outrageous things done in the name of co-operation over the years so it doesn't suprise me. I guess if co-operators had stuck to their roots none of this would be happening and the public would be more receptive to the idea of co-operatives in the health care industry. The Credit Unions were very supportive of the last bankruptcy bill which is a mill stone around the neck of all poor people. They also defend the exorbitant charges of Visa and Mastercard. So much for cutting out the middleman.","2009-08-25 21:19:32","72.95.104.171"

I would like to take this opportunity to recommend the following important website to Mr. Rosiak and readers:

www.NoPlaceForDenial.com.

In a nutshell, the Anti-Defamation League and some other (though not all) top Jewish American lobbying groups have colluded with Turkey to deny the Armenian genocide and defeat Armenian genocide resolutions in Congress.  

Please click there on Timeline and News Archive.

Most important, please navigate through the Q and A section to ""History of Lobbying...""  See here:

http://npfdinfo.blogspot.com/2007/10/press-kit-history-of-opposing.html

You will be shocked at the documentation there.

The collusion between the Jewish American lobby and Turkey dovetails in every detail with what former FBI translator and whistleblower Sibel Edmonds had said.  
Mr. Rosiak, your article above has rendered a valuable public service to the American people.","2009-09-10 14:37:47","63.118.13.131"

The fee for Smartech's services include hosting for 31 state parties' websites housed on the RNC's platform, email hosting for the RNC and 40 state parties, and hosting for a vast majority of the data stored on the RNC's voter microtargeting program Voter Vault. 

“The Republican National Committee shelled out $1.4 million dollars over the last six months for Web sites and services, much of which was spent on GOP.com?” Hardly. The impression you give, Luke, is that the RNC apportioned money for the relaunch of GOP.com with little regard for fiscal responsibility, when the reality of the situation is quite different. The bill for Smartech is one that is typically high, though admittedly elevated with the RNC’s recent endeavor in updating their online presence.
