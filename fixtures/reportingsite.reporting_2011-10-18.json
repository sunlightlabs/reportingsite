The rationale has been that releasing information about which banks and institutions seek temporary assistance from the Fed could cause runs on banks and panic in the markets.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNever has this secrecy faced a bigger challenge than during and immediately after the recent financial crisis, when the Fed, beginning in 2007, <a href=\"http://timeline.stlouisfed.org/index.cfm?p=timeline#\">launched</a> an unprecedented raft of programs with an alphabet soup of names&mdash;<a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/taf.htm\">TAF</a> and <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/talf.htm\">TALF</a> and <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/tslf.htm\">TLSF</a>--to help prop up ailing banks and other institutions hit hard when the subprime mortgage market crashed. It also ramped up traditional <a href=\"http://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/discountwindowbook.cfm?hdrID=14&amp;dtlID=43]\">&quot;discount window&quot;</a> lending, a permanent Fed program through which banks may borrow funds on a short-term basis, and set up currency swap lines with certain foreign central banks. Journalists and some members of Congress began to demand more information about the billions of dollars made available through these programs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn May 2008 Bloomberg News&#39; reporter<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=alcABq2uaBOc\"> Mark Pittman</a> filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with Federal Reserve requesting data about details of &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/discountwindowbook.cfm?hdrID=14&amp;dtlID=43]\">discount window</a>&rdquo; lending and collateral, an act with a certain amount of chutzpah, as the Fed had never made this information public. Unsurprisingly, the central bank <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/nyregion/14fed.html?pagewanted=print\">stonewalled</a> him.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMeanwhile, the crisis continued to worsen. In September 2008 the investment house Lehman Brothers collapsed. The following month, Congress <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h1424/show\">approved</a> $700 billion in bailout money for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), to be run by the U.S. Treasury, as opposed to the Fed. The Federal Reserve continued to increase its lending through various emergency programs. The Federal Reserve&#39;s balance sheet, made public <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/\">here</a>, showed enormous increases--but the public had no information about which institutions were benefitting.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn November 2008, Bloomberg News <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aKr.oY2YKc2g\">filed</a> a lawsuit challenging the Fed, which had not provided any records to Pittman in response to his request, and had not even provided an official denial that would have enabled him to file an appeal. Fox News Network <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/03/31/fed-names-banks-drew-loans-crisis/\">later</a> filed a similar lawsuit, and other news organizations joined in by filing legal briefs in support.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome in Congress, from the far left and right also wanted answers. In a May 2009 hearing, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I, Vt.), <a href=\"http://sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/media/view/index.cfm?id=316acc67-3f29-44bd-a38d-65011e1907e0\">questioned</a> Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke point blank about which institutions had received loans through the emergency programs. Bernanke said &quot;no.&quot; &quot;The reason that is counterproductive and will destroy the value of the program is that banks won&#39;t come to the table,&quot; continued Bernanke.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas launched a <a href=\"http://www.ronpaul.com/congress/legislation/111th-congress-200910/audit-the-federal-reserve-hr-1207/\">campaign</a> to require a public audit of the Fed, sponsoring legislation along with now former Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla. However, it was a similar <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00137\">amendment</a> by Sanders, which also required that the Fed disclose details of loans during the crisis, that made it into the final bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn July 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/show\">Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a>. The law <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/text?version=enr&amp;nid=t0:enr:12544\">mandates</a> that the Fed release data on emergency loans made from December 2007 through the date of passage of the law. However, the discount window data sought by Bloomberg and Fox News Network was not included in this requirement. The Fed must also release details of emergency loan facilities in the future--this time including &quot;discount window&quot; details--after a a certain time lag.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Dodd-Frank law also requires the U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) to issue two reports--one a general audit of the Fed&#39;s emergency loan programs--again excluding the discount window loans--and another that examines whether there were conflict of interest issues raised in the set up of these programs. It also <a href=\"http://pogoblog.typepad.com/pogo/2011/10/three-takeaway-lessons-from-the-gao-audit-of-the-federal-reserve.html\">requires</a> audits of new emergency loan programs in the future--but these will not be made public until one year after the program has ended.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn December 2010, the Fed<a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/reform_transaction.htm\"> released</a> massive data files about emergency lending programs throughout the crisis. (At the time, the Sunlight Foundation&#39;s Ryan Sibley <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/taxonomy/term/talf/\">reported</a> on one of them, the Term Asset-Backed Loan Facility (TALF).)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut the Fed did not release details of discount window lending during the crisis to the public until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was required to do so. In March 2011, the court <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/banking/2011-03-21-fed-bank-loan-disclosure.htm\">let</a> a lower court&#39;s orders stand that required the Fed to release the discount loan data in response to the lawsuits by Bloomberg and Fox News. In doing so, it overruled objections lodged by the Clearinghouse Association, an organization containing the largest commercial banks, which had appealed the lower court&#39;s decision. Later that month, the Fed <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-31/federal-reserve-releases-discount-window-loan-records-under-court-order.html\">released</a> the data, in the form of 894 PDF files on two CD-ROMS--an awkward format to manipulate and analyze.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBloomberg News later published an exhaustive analysis that included emergency loan and discount window data <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/data-visualization/federal-reserve-emergency-lending/#/overview/?sort=nomPeakValue&amp;group=none&amp;view=peak&amp;position=0&amp;comparelist=&amp;search=\">here</a>. It showed that the nation&#39;s largest financial institutions--Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, State Street Corp--benefitted the most from the extra help. Many foreign banks, such as Deutsche Bank, Barclays, and Credit Suisse Group also ranked near the top. Journalists also plumbed these data for stories such as <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-real-housewives-of-wall-street-look-whos-cashing-in-on-the-bailout-20110411\">this</a> one by Matt Taibbi, which showed how two wives of high level Morgan Stanley executives were able to profit from the TALF emergency lending program.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe GAO <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-696\">issued</a> its audit of the Federal Reserve Board lending programs in July 2011, and in October, a House Financial Services Subcommittee chaired by Rep. Paul held a <a href=\"http://financialservices.house.gov/Calendar/EventSingle.aspx?EventID=262034\">hearing</a> on the findings.

In contrast, the <a href=\"http://www.uaw.org/articles/uaw-statement-proposed-us-korea-free-trade-agreement\">United Auto Workers</a> supported the recent trade deal as &ldquo;a dramatic step toward changing from a one-way street to a two-way street for trade between the U.S. and South Korea.&quot;</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-10-14 16:12:05", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "lobbying-behind-us-korea-free-trade-agreement", "tags": "Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker, Foreign lobbying, FLIT, Lobbying, FARA, ", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2481, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-10-14 15:08:44", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 25, "timestamp": "2011-10-14 13:04:13", "image": "", "title": "Online poker lobby gives timely donations to pair of congressmen pushing its cause", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tCongressman Joe Barton, who is now&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1011/65823.html\" target=\"_blank\">lobbying the special deficit panel</a>&nbsp;to legalize Internet poker, got some not so subtle nudges from the Poker Players Alliance when he introduced his own online poker bill in June.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn June 20, just days before Barton, R-Texas, brought his bill to the floor, the PPA&rsquo;s PAC gave Barton&rsquo;s campaign committee $2,500, according to the group&rsquo;s Federal Election Commission report.

MacKinnon and his partner Joseph Vasapoli, who also lobbies to repeal the online poker ban, each gave $1,000 to Barton on Jan. 28, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Each had contributed a total of $3,400 and $1,000 in previous years. Another PPA lobbyist, Chris Giblin of Ogilvy Government Relations, also donated $1,000 on Jan. 28.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLast year, MacKinnon also hosted a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.politicalpartytime.org/2010/12/16/in-energy-and-commerce-lobbyists-fred-upton-has-fundraising-friends/\" target=\"_blank\">fundraiser</a>&nbsp;for super committee member Fred Upton, R-Mich., with whom Barton has discussed the online poker issue, Politico reported.

But the ECB does not name which banks or institutions are receiving these dollars. Who gets the money is anybody&#39;s guess.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the response of worsening economic conditions in Europe, in late June the Fed <a href=\"http://federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110629a.htm\">announced</a> that it was extending authority for such swap arrangements with the European Central Bank (ECB) and three other foreign banks. This swap line is similar to that set up during the 2008 financial crisis, which the Fed had <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/feds-growing-again/\">renewed</a> in May 2010.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA $1.353 billion draw on the currency line on October 13 over an 84-day term is the longest term swap of these recent arrangements, as the rest of the recent deals have been written for seven days. Longer term swaps are considered more serious, as they show that the foreign central banks want more time before returning the dollars.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnder such swap agreements, a foreign bank draws on dollars at the Fed in exchange for its own currency. The foreign bank agrees to buy back its currency at a certain date at the same exchange rate, plus interest. This gives the foreign banks, which have become dollar-starved as American investors pull out their money in European ventures, U.S. currency to lend out to banks and institutions.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile both the Fed and the ECB release up-to-date summary data on their websites about these exchanges, no details are provided on which specific banks benefit. When former Rep. Alan Grayson, D., Fla., <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0NYBTkE1yQ\">asked</a> Federal Reserve Chairman Bernard Bernanke in July 2009 point blank about who received the loans enabled by foreign currency swaps, the chairman replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&quot; Bernanke maintained that there is no need for the public to know such information because the swaps are collateralized with foreign currency and paid back with interest, and therefore risk to he Fed is low.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut critics say more transparency is needed. &quot;How do we protect against conflicts of interest...and how do we evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts, without knowing where the money went?&quot; says Mark Calabria, director of director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe banking industry has long opposed disclosure about the loans they receive from central banks, arguing that it could harm individual banks&#39; competitiveness and reduce the effectiveness of central bank policy. Recently the Clearinghouse, which represents the nation&#39;s largest banks, <a href=\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/2010/03/11/clearing-house-association-joins-board-of-governors-of-the-fed-v-bloomberg/\">made</a> this argument--but failed--in an attempt to stop a court-ordered release of &quot;discount window&quot; lending by the Fed during the financial crisis. (See also <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/Federal_Reserve_forced_to_say/\">this</a> story on the Fed&#39;s secrecy about its emergency loans.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe recently approved Dodd-Frank financial reform law mandates that certain loan data--including foreign currency swaps--be made available to the public. But there is no requirement that the loans made by foreign central banks in conjunction with the swap line be made public, nor does the ECB have a policy of making such information public.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile the foreign central banks are dipping into the currency swap line now in the face of deterioriating economic conditions, so far the levels of swaps are nowhere near what they were during the financial crisis. When the world&rsquo;s economy spun out of control in the fall of 2008, one of the main symptoms was the freezing of private foreign exchange markets, the means by which foreign economies usually obtain the dollars they need.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInto the gap stepped the Fed, which opened up credit swap lines to bring liquidity back to the private markets. At the height of the crisis, the Fed&rsquo;s outstanding dollar swaps <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorkfed.org%2Fresearch%2Fepr%2Fforthcoming%2F1008gold.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=%22federal%20reserve%22%20%24600%20billion%20currency%20swap%20research&amp;ei=WaGdTrnmN87F0AHrtvyGCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFvczmu5FT-T_vPCgNkxmk6KMePGg&amp;cad=rja\">rose</a> to $686 billion billion by the end of 2008, according to a recent paper published on the Federal Reserve Board of New York website, <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-696\">according</a> to an audit of Federal Reserve emergency programs recently released by the U.S. General Accountability Office</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEighty percent of the aggregate dollars swapped by the Fed went to the ECB. Nine other central banks also participated in the program, including the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank, and the Bank of Japan.

Kaiser. An investment&nbsp;by the Tulsa billionaire&#39;s family foundation in <a href=\"http://www.iwatchnews.org/environment/energy/solyndra\">Solyndra</a>, whose bankruptcy may leave taxpayers on the hook for $535 million in federal loans, has raised speculation that the administration acted in part to aid a financial supporter. But the impact on taxpayers of Kaiser&#39;s career goes far beyond the $535 million loss. Kaiser has built his fortune in part through shrewdly playing the Internal Revenue Code. In one six year period, during which he increased his net worth enough to land him on the Forbes list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, Kaiser reported taxable income to the Internal Revenue Service just once, totaling $11,699--equivalent to a full-time hourly wage of $5.62.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSolyndra&#39;s bankruptcy has led to multiple investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Treasury&#39;s Inspector General and a House subcommittee. Kaiser&#39;s role as a fundraiser for Obama&#39;s 2008 campaign--the Tulsa World reported that, in March 2007, the oilman hosted an event at his home for the candidate, where Obama raised about $250,000--has led to speculation that the administration intervened on behalf of the ill-fated Solyndra&#39;s loan application to benefit a campaign supporter.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition to Solyndra, the George Kaiser Family Foundation <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/white-house-visitor-logs/\">has investments</a> worth hundreds of millions in energy firms, most of them in the oil and gas industry. The Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/investment-in-failed-solar-firm-solyndra-raises-questions-about-nonprofits-purpose/2011/09/27/gIQAVByZ2K_story.html\">reported</a> that, in 2005, Senate investigators focused on the tax implications of the foundation, whose assets at the end of 2009 had grown to nearly $4 billion. GKFF has averaged more than $194 million a year in income from those assets over the last five years and issued grants that averaged about $53 million a year--or just 1.7 percent of its net assets.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat wasn&#39;t the first time Kaiser caught the attention of government tax officials. In 1997, the Internal Revenue Service sent Kaiser and his companies tax bills for more than $72 million in back taxes, interest and penalties, covering individual and corporate returns filed from 1986 to 1992. Kaiser filed returns showing his personal income averaging <i>negative</i> $860,000 between 1986 and 1991; his holding company, GBK Corp., and its subsidiaries reported an aggregate loss from 1989 to 1992 of $507,000--some years it made money and paid taxes, others it claimed losses and paid none.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThose figures come from a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/256011-cheating-of-america-excerpt.html \">chapter</a> in a 2001 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Cheating-America-Avoidance-Evasion-Billions/dp/0060084316\">The Cheating of America</a>, written by Charles Lewis, the Center for Public Integrity and this author. Cheating investigated how wealthy individuals and powerful corporations avoid taxes. Tax avoidance is legal--and the strategies Kaiser used to minimize his own and his company&#39;s tax burden were certainly legal--and in the end, the Internal Revenue Service settled both cases for pennies on the dollar. How he did it had as much to do with the economics of the domestic and international energy markets and those of the state of Oklahoma as it did with the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKaiser&#39;s first fortune came from domestic energy production. When he took over his father&#39;s business, Kaiser-Francis Oil, in 1969, it had all of ten employees. The 1970s energy shocks that resulted in lines at gas stations and natural gas shortages proved to be a boon for the domestic oil and gas industry, and Kaiser built his company up into Oklahoma&#39;s largest privately-held producer of natural gas. At the peak of the oil boom, when a popular bumper sticker in the state read, &quot;If you don&#39;t own an oil well, get one,&quot; Kaiser started to sell his--at peak prices.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen oil prices started to decline in the 1980s due to increased OPEC production, the boom went bust, and affected far more than the Oklahoma energy industry. Unemployment soared and real estate values dropped, leaving many homeowners with negative equity. Banks that had loaned wildly during the boom ended up with mountains of bad debt on their books backed by devalued assets, including empty office towers and bankrupt energy producers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDuring the bust, Kaiser changed course again, and started buying up bankrupt firms like Waterford Energy, which had all of $7 million in assets and some $151 million in losses on its books. The losses were valuable--under the Internal Revenue Code, a company can use past losses as credits, known as net operating losses, to reduce their tax burden in profitable years. In 1990, after Kaiser acquired the firm, Waterford filed a plan of reorganization in a Texas bankruptcy court that stated that one of the principal motivations of the plan was to &quot;preserve the tax attributes of the debtor in order to allow the debtor to realize the benefits of the tax attributes.&quot; Kaiser&#39;s company, GBK Corporation--the parent of Kaiser-Francis Oil--began claiming those losses on its tax returns.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 1997, the Internal Revenue Service disallowed the Waterford losses, arguing that &quot;losses resulting from acquisitions made to evade or avoid income tax are prohibited.&quot; The service sent Kaiser a bill for $24 million. Kaiser fought the IRS in U.S. Tax Court, ultimately settling the case for $3.7 million, or 15 cents on the dollar. &quot;During the desperate depression of the 1980s, there were no oil and gas companies without net operating losses,&quot; Kaiser said during an interview for the book in 2001. &quot;Any company you&#39;d buy had them. There was no indication that we didn&#39;t comply with the Internal Revenue Code.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 1991, the same year that Kaiser merged Kaiser-Francis Oil with Waterford, he bought the Bank of Oklahoma from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Bank of Oklahoma had largely avoided making rash loans during the state&#39;s oil boom economy that led so many other savings institutions--including savings and loans, 162 of which shut down during the crisis--from going broke. But in 1984, Bank of Oklahoma bought Fidelity Bank N.A., an Oklahoma City-based bank whose books were loaded with bad loans. Kaiser, who was a shareholder and served on Bank of Oklahoma&#39;s board of directors at the time, favored the deal, which didn&#39;t work out so well. Fidelity&#39;s bad loans were a drag on Bank of Oklahoma, which, after declaring a quarterly loss of $51 million in 1986, turned to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for a bailout. The FDIC deemed it essential to the state&#39;s economy, and rather than shut it down bailed it out the bank for $130 million. Five years later, after returning the bank to profitability, the FDIC sold it to Kaiser--for $61 million.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe deal was a profitable one--by 1998, his shares in the company were worth some $917 million; on April 26, 2011, when the bank issued its last proxy statement, Kaiser&#39;s shares were worth more than $2.1 billion, while his foundation held another $251 million of its stock.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe IRS questioned where the money came from when Kaiser purchased the bank. In 1991, when he bought it, he filed a tax returns claiming no income, but instead losses of $2.3 million. The year before, in 1990, when he submitted his $61 million bid to the FDIC, he told the IRS he had lost $115,000. Kaiser&#39;s total income taxes paid those years: zero.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe money came from GBK Corp., the same company that claimed millions in losses from bankrupt energy firms like Waterford Energy, which loaned Kaiser $100 million. The IRS concluded that the money was actually a dividend paid by the company to Kaiser, and in 1997 sent him a bill for $48.6 million in back taxes, interest and penalties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;There are about 11 things you have to show to disprove that,&quot; Kaiser said of the IRS&#39;s contention that the $100 million was a dividend, &quot;and the only one I didn&#39;t have was the corporate minutes. I&#39;m the only director and I hold all the directors&#39; meetings in the shower.

But while the commission gathers post-employment information from former employees, it does not make this information readily available.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEven when these records of the SEC&#39;s so-called &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; are requested through the Freedom of Information Act, they tend to be incomplete and heavily redacted, according to <a href=\"http://www.pogo.org/pogo-files/reports/financial-oversight/revolving-regulators/fo-fra-20110513.html\">a report</a> by the Project on Government Oversight.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf an employee leaves the SEC and within two years and decides to work representing a company before the SEC, that employee must send a statement to the SEC that discloses the new job. POGO obtained those statements for a 5-year period, 2006 through 2010, and used the records to created a searchable online database.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn about a month, POGO plans to update its data with more than 5 years of additional former SEC employee statements it requested from the FEC, POGO investigator Michael Smallberg said. The data will include 2001-2011 information, and &ldquo;it will let us look at a longer 10-year trend in these revolving door movements,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the POGO data, the most active former employees from 2006 to 2010 had previously worked in the SEC&#39;s enforcement division. For example, within two years of leaving the enforcement division at the SEC, <a href=\"http://www.stblaw.com/bios/PBresnan.htm\">Peter Bresnan</a> took a <a href=\"http://pogoarchives.org/tools-and-data/fo/sec/bresnan-20091116-180-181.pdf\">lawyer job</a> at Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett and worked on the <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21407.htm\">SEC v. Bank of America Corp. case</a>. Bank of America settled for $150 million in the case, which alleged that before the bank merged with Merrill Lynch, it did not disclose employee bonuses or financial losses to shareholders.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;There are no laws or regulations that would generally prevent a former SEC employee from going to work for a regulated entity immediately after leaving the Commission,&rdquo; according to POGO&#39;s report. &ldquo;However, when a former employee appears before the SEC on behalf of an outside client just days after leaving the Commission, it raises questions about whether they might have shown favorable treatment to their new employer during their time at the SEC.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFormer SEC securities compliance examiner Matthew Beller left that job for at <a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=29780953\">GPS Partners</a>, which provides hedge fund support mostly for corporations and the wealthy. He now is the chief compliance officer at <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/company/cor-capital-llc\">COR Capital</a>, another investment advisory <a href=\"http://www.corfunds.com/\">company</a>. In his required <a href=\"http://pogoarchives.org/tools-and-data/fo/sec/beller-20080303-153-154.pdf\">statement to the SEC</a>, Beller asked that his letter receive &ldquo;confidential treatment &hellip; because it may refer to an ongoing nonpublic investigation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=36549\">Margaret &ldquo;Mitzi&rdquo; Moore</a>, previously senior counsel in the <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie.shtml\">Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations</a> division of the SEC, sent one <a href=\"http://pogoarchives.org/tools-and-data/fo/sec/moore-20060313-236-238.pdf\">statement to the commission</a> to cover a wide range of topics she planned to discuss with then SEC chairmen Christopher Cox on behalf of the &ldquo;Financial Services Roundtable.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to Moore&#39;s letter, &ldquo;The Roundtable represents 100 of the largest integrated financial services companies providing banking, insurance, and investment products and services to the American consumer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Roundtable member companies provide fuel for America&#39;s economic engine, accounting directly for $40.7 trillion in managed assets, $960 billion in revenue and 2.3 million jobs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese SEC statements were given to POGO in pdf files, so the government watchdog group had to enter pertinent information into a database by hand, Smallberg said. On each form, the SEC allowed POGO to see the name of the firm the former SEC employee went to work for, but the agency redacted which companies those firms represent. Some of the files also appear to be missing, based on information POGO gathered about former SEC employees and the date that former employee spoke before the commission.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe reasoning the SEC gave for redacting client names was often that the client is involved in an ongoing investigation. In that case, when the SEC is redacting client names on records from 2001, &ldquo;it kind of makes you wonder what&#39;s going on with these investigations,&rdquo; Smallberg said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe SEC has faced criticism for being less like a regulatory agency and more like a <a href=\"http://www.all-about-forensic-science.com/support-files/fraud-schemes.pdf\">&ldquo;sleeping watchdog&rdquo;</a> that has <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2009/oig-509-exec-summary.pdf\">failed to crack down</a> on the Wall Street corruption.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlong with its report that came out with the 2006-2010 data, POGO issued a recommendation that Dodd-Frank financial reform rules include requiring the SEC to post all of its former employee statements online<strong>. </strong>That has yet to happen.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>About the data</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>What: </b> Disclosure documents former SEC employees are required to send the FEC if their new job involves representing clients that the SEC oversees. The statements include the statement sender&#39;s current employer and the issues the sender will address before the commission she or he used to work for.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Where: </b> The SEC does not make this data available online despite requests. However, the Project on Government Oversight has requested the records and turned them into a <a href=\"http://www.pogo.org/tools-and-data/sec-revolving-door-database/\">searchable online database</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Availability: </b> The data can be obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request but the SEC redacts some information, including the name of the company the former SEC employee represents. The FOIA request also only returns pdf files, not an actual data set. The easiest way to access the data is through POGO&#39;s website. POGO is considering making a bulk version of its dataset available upon request.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Usability: </b> Through the SEC, the records are pdf files and cannot be analyzed in a database. Through POGO&#39;s website, the information from the records has been turned into a searchable online database that does not yet allow users to download raw data.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-10-11 10:48:44", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "government-watchdog-group-offers-sec-revolving-door-data-online-", "tags": "", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2476, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-10-07 15:36:18", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 28, "timestamp": "2011-10-06 12:25:32", "image": "", "title": "Sunlight Live Team Prepares for Oct 11 Debate", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tTuesday, Oct. 11, will mark the 9th Republican presidential debate, two weeks after a string of debates in Florida, California and South Carolina.

A <a href=\"http://img.ibtimes.com/www/articles/20111007/227265_herman-cain-leads-mitt-romney-zogby-poll-republican-presidential-race.htm\">recent Zogby poll</a> put candidate Herman Cain, initially regarded by a longshot as many, in first place and ahead of former Massachusett&#39;s Gov. Mitt Romney by 20 percent. Cain&#39;s ascent comes as an early standout,&nbsp;Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., a favorite among evangelical voters and the Tea Party crowd,&nbsp;has seen her support drop nearly in half. Two weeks ago, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20115655-503544.html\">CBS poll among likely Republican primary voters</a>&nbsp;showed her at 7 percent in the polls. That number is now at 4 percent. The drop may have to do with her&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/michele-bachmann-continues-perry-attack-claims-hpv-vaccine-might-cause-mental-retardation/2011/09/13/gIQAbJBcPK_blog.html\">controversial</a>&nbsp;statement that the HPV vaccine, which is designed to protect against cervical cancer, caused mental retardation. The Center for Disease Control refutes that claims.&nbsp;The comment was made in response to Texas Gov. Rick Perry&#39;s defense of his decision as Texas governor to require girls in Texas receive the vaccine. Since 2001, the HPV vaccine&#39;s manufacturer,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/15/opinion/krumholz-beckel-perry-pharmaceutical/index.html\">Merck</a>, contributed nearly $30,000 to his gubernatorial campaigns; Perry&#39;s former Chief of Staff, Mike Toomey, went to lobby for Merck.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen Perry entered the Presidential race nearly two months ago, many saw him as Romney&rsquo;s biggest competitor. The two clashed during previous debates, with critics agreeing that Perry&#39;s performance was weak. The Texas governor got into the race as an almost instant frontrunner, but has fallen back in the pack, and now faces questions on a range of issues, including an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/rick-perry-familys-hunting-camp-still-known-to-many-by-old-racially-charged-name/2011/10/01/gIQAOhY5DL_story.html\">offensively named hunting spo</a>t that his father rented in the 1980s.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwo weeks ago the CBS News poll showed Perry beating Romney with 23 percent, but that number now stands at 12 percent. The dip in poll numbers is hardly the end for Perry. He received endorsements from several influential Republicans including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rick-perry-picks-endorsement-sen-jim-inhofe-climate/story?id=14407804\">Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla.</a>, and <a href=\"http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2011/08/jeb-hensarling-endorses-rick-p.html\">Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas</a>, co-chair of the so-called super committee on debt reduction. In addition Perry impressively raised over $17 million in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/us/politics/17-million-in-donations-buoy-rick-perrys-white-house-run.html\">campaign contributions</a>&nbsp;in 49 days.&nbsp;Last financial quarter Perry&#39;s rival, Romney, raised over $18 million but was only predicted to bring in between $10 million and $13 million for the summer quarter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA recent poll showed Texas Congressman Ron Paul capturing only <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/us/politics/17-million-in-donations-buoy-rick-perrys-white-house-run.html\">8 percent of the vote</a>, however the proud Libertarian&#39;s financial record shows a potentially stronger candidate prepared to stay in the race for the long haul. During the spring financial quarter Paul raised over $4 million. During the summer quarter, which ended September 30, Paul doubled his previous donations and brought in over $8 million.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoining Paul in the middle of the pack is former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who according to the CBS poll secured seven percent of primary voters. &nbsp;Gingrich&#39;s campaign has not sailed smoothly, his performance in previous debates and mass exit of staff proved trying. Gingrich, who participated in the famous &quot;Contract for America&quot; during his tenure as a Congressman recently promoted a revised,<a href=\"http://savannahnow.com/news/2011-10-06/gingrich-pitches-contract-america-sun-city#.To4Zxc3O4zw\"> &quot;21st Century Contract with America</a>,&quot; in Sun City, S.C.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMeanwhile, former Godfather&rsquo;s Pizza CEO, Herman Cain, who had been lagging since he entered the race due to his vague foreign policy stances and inflammatory statements about Islam and immigration, has leapt to the top. He was a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/09/24/perry-says-rivals-made-mistake-by-skipping-florida-test-vote/\">surprise winner</a> of the Florida straw poll over Perry, who had just turned in another poor debate performance two days before.&nbsp;Recently, though, he has gotten a boost, with CBS News showing him&nbsp;tied with Romney at 17 percent, and Zogby finding him the clear frontrunner. For a candidate who faced calls from several&nbsp;<a href=\"http://somosrepublicans.com/2011/07/national-hispanic-gop-groups-wants-herman-cain-to-quit-presidential-race/\">groups to leave the race</a>&nbsp;after his comments on Islam, its a remarkable turnaround, one that he&#39;s relishing.&nbsp;On the campaign trail, Cain multi-tasks not only his run for the Republican nod but also the promotion of his new book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/10/herman-cain-skips-out-on-early-states-to-push-his-new-book/246260/\">&quot;This is Herman Cain!

His foundation is also heavily invested in the energy sector--according to its <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1265376/000095012311073482/c21037e13fvhr.txt\">most recent Securities and Exchange Commission</a> filing, it held more than $750 million worth of investments in oil and natural gas producers, including a $371 million state in Unit Corp., a Tulsa-based oil producer and pipeline operator.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKaiser&#39;s role as a fundraiser for Obama&#39;s 2008 campaign has led to speculation that the administration intervened on behalf of the ill-fated Solyndra&#39;s loan application due to political influence. The Tulsa World reported that, in March 2007, the oilman hosted an event at his home for the candidate, where Obama raised about $250,000. In addition to bundling for Obama, Kaiser boosted his donations to candidates in the 2010 election cycle, giving more than $180,000 to state and federal candidates--mostly to Democrats--more than double the $79,850 he gave in the 2008 cycle, according to <a href=\"http://transparencydata.com/contributions/#Y29udHJpYnV0b3JfZnQ9R2VvcmdlJTIwS2Fpc2VyJmNvbnRyaWJ1dG9yX3N0YXRlPU9LJm1zYV9mdD1UdWxzYQ==\">data</a> from the Center for Responsive Politics and the National Institute for Money in State Politics, downloaded from TransparencyData.com.

Farrell, who left the NEC in January 2011, co-authored a <a href=\"http://www.issues.org/26.3/farrell.html\">paper</a> outlining the administration&#39;s approach to technology--including energy--in&nbsp; Spring 2010. She also gave the keynote address at the <a href=\"http://www.energyinnovationnetwork.org/~/media/Files/WH_summary_report.ashx\">White House Energy Innovation Conference</a> in May 2010. Knowles said the purpose of the meeting was &quot;to brief her on the broad scope of our energy policy analysis,&quot; which set as its goals reducing U.S. oil consumption by four million barrels per day by 2030 and the elimination of more than 12 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions. The analysis rated 35 different policies for achieving those goals.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn June 25, 2010, Kaiser, Knowles, Levit and <a href=\"http://influenceexplorer.com/politician/brad-carson-d/8e10f248f130418ca5ee3bb0f70aee77\">Brad Carson</a>, director of NEPI and a two-term Democratic Congressman from Tulsa, met with White House counsel Peter Rouse, according to Knowles, and <a href=\"http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Heather_Zichal\">Heather Zichal</a>, deputy assistant to the President for energy and climate change. White House visitor logs misreport the meeting, instead listing Caitlin Naidoff, an aide to Rouse, as an attendee.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe meeting with Rouse and Zichal was to discuss energy policy. &quot;By this time the NEPI/RFF report was finished but not yet published,&quot; he said in an email, adding that they wanted to share the findings with the administration.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCarson told Sunlight that, &quot;Cap and Trade was still alive in Congress then,&quot; and described the conversations as being, &quot;Just general chatter about what was going on in energy policy.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn April 14, 2011, Kaiser, Knowles and Levit met with Rouse and Dan Utech, an energy special assistant in the White House. Knowles said the meeting was to follow up on the report, which concluded that a tax on oil use or carbon emissions, or a cap and trade policy, would be the most effective policies. &quot;Given that these have been shown to not be politically viable,&quot; Knowles wrote, &quot;we pointed out alternative policies that were effective but more costly.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKaiser is on the board of directors of NEPI, and the George Kaiser Family Foundation disclosed making $1.9 million in grants to the organization in 2008 and 2009.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition to Solyndra and Unit Corp., Kaiser&#39;s foundation has multimillion dollar investments in domestic energy producers <a href=\"http://influenceexplorer.com/organization/anadarko-petroleum/e50c563abf124e69a99f4822d55ff6c4\">Anadarko Petroleum</a>&nbsp;($205 million), Sandridge Energy ($33.6 million) and <a href=\"http://influenceexplorer.com/organization/apache-corp/60ef78c755554136bc6340771bce84e9\">Apache Corp.</a>&nbsp;($18.5 million), as well as a $6.7 million stake in SolarReserve, which won a <a href=\"https://lpo.energy.gov/?projects=solarreserve-llc-crescent-dunes\">$737 million loan guarantee</a> from the Department of Energy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe nonprofit&#39;s latest SEC filing also showed a $124 million stake in Petroleo Brasileiros , or Petrobas, the Brazilian oil company.

Sixty percent more noninterest accounts carry fees and balance requirements than they did last year. ATM fees are at an all-time high for the seventh consecutive year. Maintenance fees for checking accounts have increased.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMeanwhile, many consumers will have a hard time getting information from their banks about these very fees. Fewer than half of nearly 400 banks surveyed by researchers at U.S. PIRG, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, provided paper copies of fee schedules the first time they were requested, according to the group&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.uspirg.org/home/reports/report-archives/financial-privacy--security/financial-privacy--security/big-banks-bigger-fees-a-national-survey-of-bank-fees-and-fee-disclosure-policies2\">report</a>, published last spring.

Most prominently they compare only a few basic features of the accounts. While fee schedules are sometimes available, they are often buried in links at the bottom of long pages, then downloadable only as ponderous multi-megabyte pdf files.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder the 1991 Truth in Savings Act, banks are <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6500-3300.html\">required</a> to supply customers with a fee schedule of charges. The types of fees banks must report include: maintenance fees, such as monthly service fees; fees to open or close an account; fees related to deposits or withdrawals, such as ATM fees; and fees for special services, such as stop-payment fees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in practice it&rsquo;s hard to hunt down this information. PIRG&rsquo;s findings are similar to those in a 2008 General Accounting Office (GAO) <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08281.pdf\">survey</a> of 185 bank branches which found that one out of four did not provide information on checking and savings account fees.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPIRG is lobbying the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to make disclosure better, by requiring that banks post fees on the Internet in a searchable, machine-readable format, &quot;which would encourage the establishment of local online bank shopping guides by community groups.&quot; The group also asks that the disclosure format be simplified in a tabular format, and that the Federal Reserve should go back to publishing an annual survey of bank fees, among other recommendations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut in an interview, <a href=\"http://influenceexplorer.com/individual/edmund-m-mierzwinski/edff4a0c9ff24a109a20e8b7ecc507a0\">Ed Mierzwinski</a>, PIRG&#39;s federal consumer program director, says that with the fledgling consumer agency under attack in Congress, there has been no action yet. PIRG has <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000058093&amp;year=2011\">reported</a> spending $159,000 on federal lobbying efforts so far this year.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs we <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/data-lacking-on-overdraft-fees/\">wrote</a> earlier this year, information is also spotty on how much money banks make on individual fees, as the quarterly &quot;call&quot; reports they file with federal regulators lump this information into broad categories.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>About the data</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>What</strong>: Bank fees on checking and savings accounts</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Where: </strong>The 1991 Truth in Savings Act requires banks to disclose fees to customers</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Availability: </strong>Banks are supposed to supply information on fees upon request, but a recent survey showed that fewer than half do.

Both Israel and Palestine have a long history of lobbying the U.S. and in the past year alone, the Palestinian Liberation Organization spent over one million on public relations. During the same time, Israel spent over $13 million on lobbying, public relations and related costs. Both interests contacted important policy makers and set up a vast PR campaign.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the last few months as the issues of statehood began to be more widely discussed and in the run up to the General Assembly convening in New York this week, both parties have upped their lobbying portfolio, hiring two lobby shops each.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Palestinian Liberation Organization has a long history of lobbying and has recently decided to supplement its efforts by expanding their lobbying contracts. The PLO delegation to the United States hired Bell Pottinger on <a href=\"http://www.fara.gov/docs/6056-Exhibit-AB-20110823-2.pdf\">August 10</a> for a monthly fee of $30,000, according to the contract.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPast lobbying disclosures filed with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agent Registrant Act (FARA) show that the <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/country/Palestine/\">Palestine Liberation Organization</a> contacted top decision makers, media and academia, and list meetings with <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/palestinian-lobbyists-meet-key-decision-makers/\">up and coming policy leaders</a>.

The PLO is the only Palestinian political outfit that is recognized by the UN.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the General Delegation of the PLO, in their advocacy, they &ldquo;spend large amounts of time addressing misinformation on the Hill.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/lobbying/fara/1106\">Palestinian American Chamber of Commerce</a> (PACC) is the newest Palestinian client to register under FARA in September. PACC contracted with Qorvis Communications for public relations support.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne of the new Israeli contracts is with World Likud, an organization that pursues international grassroots organizing in support of Israel. World Likud could play an important part in the UN recognition debate with their very strong assertion that, &ldquo;A Palestinian State within existing Israeli territory is not feasible.&rdquo; This is clearly at odds with Palestinian statehood recognition. World Likud hired <a href=\"http://www.fara.gov/docs/6049-Exhibit-AB-20110721-1.pdf\">Rubenstein Public Relations</a> in June of this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe World Zionist Organization also registers with FARA and engages in various education and exchange programs to encourage Jewish immigration and culture.

Israelis elect a parliament through a <a href=\"http://www.knesset.gov.il/elections16/eng/about/electoral_system_eng.htm\">proportional representation</a> system, so for Margalit to be elected, he needs to make it on to the list of Israeli Labor Party <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=235999\">primary</a> candidates and then the party would need to win seats in the election.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tQorvis Communications is a large public relations firm that has represented both Israeli and Palestinian interests in the past. Military hardware manufacturer Plasan Sasa Ltd. had a contract with PR firm Qorvis Communications from 2009 to March 2011 and now Qorvis represents the PACC.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\tFor more information on the foreign lobbying go to Sunlight Foundation&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/\">Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker</a> which digitizes information that representatives of foreign governments, political parties and government-controlled entities must disclose to the DOJ.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Israeli Embassy also contracts with Arnold &amp; Porter LLP for advice on taxation, trade and &quot;holocaust-era assets litigation.&quot; The State of Israel also has Sidley Austin LLP on its payroll.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\tIsraeli and Palestinian interests have an extensive history of lobbying the U.S. since FARA was established in the late 1930s.

UN Ambassador <a href=\"http://usun.state.gov/briefing/statements/2011/169092.htm\">Rosemary DiCarlo</a> has made U.S. opposition clear, saying, &ldquo;Let there be no doubt: symbolic actions to isolate Israel at the United Nations in September will not create an independent Palestinian state.

(You can look up what we do know about spending on issue ads and independent expenditures using this &ldquo;Follow the unlimited money&rdquo; tracker <a href=\"../../../../outside-spending/\">here</a>.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast summer, Congressional Republicans rejected the DISCLOSE Act, which would have required more corporate disclosure of political contributions&mdash;legislation that the Sunlight Foundation <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2010/09/22/voters-will-be-victims-of-disclose-act-defeat/\">supported</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe 2010 elections saw an <a href=\"../../../../2010/did-outside-money-pay/\">explosion</a> of spending by so-called 501(c)(4) organizations&mdash;otherwise nonprofit groups that may engage in some political activity&mdash;which are not required to report their donors. &quot;Super PACs,&quot; groups that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on running campaign ads, were also created.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlready, many of these organizations have <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/09/09/crossroads-groups-double-fund-raising-goals/\">begun</a> raising money for the 2012 elections. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be tremendous pressure to start sending money through c(4)s,&rdquo; says Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Public Accountability (CPA), an organization that advocates for transparency in corporate political spending.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe eight-year-old organization has pushed for corporations to disclose such spending voluntarily, with some success. But a look at these disclosures shows how much we still don&#39;t know.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor example, in 2010, during the thick of the debate over the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and its immediate aftermath, the nation&rsquo;s<a href=\"http://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/top50form.aspx\"> tenth largest</a> bank, U.S. Bancorp, voluntarily reported spending nearly $700,000 in dues to trade associations such as the Financial Services Roundtable and the American Bankers Association that in turn used such funds to help run their huge lobbying operations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere is no legal requirement that companies publicly report their contributions to such trade associations--which typically are organized under the <a href=\"http://www.muridae.com/nporegulation/documents/exempt_orgs.html\">501(c)(6)</a> section of the tax code. Only 45 major companies voluntarily disclose their payments to trade associations, according to a <a href=\"http://www.politicalaccountability.net/index.php?ht=d/ContentDir/pid/2960\">database</a> maintained by CPA.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to a recent <a href=\"http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/baruchindex/launchreport.htm\">analysis</a> by Baruch College of New York, which rated corporations on the level of their political disclosure, only 22 percent of S&amp;P 100 companies voluntarily publicly disclose their political spending, and on average, those companies that contribute the most disclose less. CPA is preparing its own index report, which will be released in October.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe mega-bank Bank of America (BOA) does <a href=\"http://investor.bankofamerica.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=71595&amp;p=irol-govpac\">not</a> disclose political activity it is not required to report elsewhere. Yet an analysis by CPA points out that public sources show that BOA is a member of such powerful trade association as the Business Roundtable, the American Bankers Association, and the Financial Services Roundtable.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd even when companies have relatively good disclosure policies, there can be big holes. Marriott International has a <a href=\"http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/MAR/0x0x479813/B4463784-ECD8-4AEB-99C2-2A1F8555C7F5/Political_Policy_Document_6-29-11.pdf\">policy</a> dated June 2011 that says it will disclose a wide range of political activities, including PAC contributions, payments to trade associations, contributions to so-called &quot;527&quot; organizations and independent expenditures. However, the curious shareholder would find no mention on the report that CEO J.W. Marriott and his brother Richard Marriott had <a href=\"http://hotel%20executives%20j.w.%20marriott%20and%20richard%20marriott/;\">given</a> $500,000 apiece to the &quot;Super PAC&quot; formed by GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney. There is no mention in Marriott policy of contributions to 501(c)(4) organizations, which do not disclose their donors.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFinally, because there is no standardized format for disclosure, companies that do provide information do so in indiosyncratic formats that must be read individually, as opposed to databases or spreadsheets that are easily analyzed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>About the data</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>What:</b> Corporate campaign contributions</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Where: </b>Currently corporations must disclose some of their political spending, but is scattered in different locations.

Please read the note at the bottom, and comments, for further clarification.]</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tReporters&#39; and consumers&#39; groups are protesting the Obama administration&#39;s decision to remove from the web a database of disciplinary actions and malpractice suits against physicians. The file, which has been online and publicly available since 2001, hides the names of individual doctors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that hasn&#39;t stopped reporters over the past decade from doing just that, using court cases and other public records to identify doctors who allegedly <a href=\"http://articles.courant.com/2000-04-30/news/0004290208_1_national-practitioner-data-bank-malpractice-settlements-dangerous-doctors\">caused a woman&#39;s death </a>through botched plastic surgery, <a href=\"http://www.healthjournalism.org/uploads/10contestscans/Metro-Papers/82_St.LouisPost-Dispatch_Bernhard_WhoProtectsthePatients.pdf\">prescribed </a>lethal doses of drugs and other alleged offenses. The reporters uncovered many cases where doctors continued to practice medicine, often without sanction, after multiple allegations of misconduct or incompetence.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrandon Stahl, a reporter for the Duluth News-Tribune, used the file, known as the Public Use File of the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB), to <a href=\"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/200289/\">discover</a> that one of the most highly-paid doctors in town had racked up nine malpractice suits and an official sanction in a few years. &quot;I think the public benefited from our use of that database,&quot; Stahl said. &quot;It was crucial for our story.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe information is now available by request only to researchers and others who say they won&#39;t use it to find doctors&#39; names. Martin Kramer, a spokesperson with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the agency that maintains the data, says that officials were legally bound to remove the file once it was brought to their attention that it could be used to violate physician confidentiality.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe data went offline earlier this month after a reporter with the Kansas City Star <a href=\"http://www.kansascity.com/2011/09/03/3119465/bad-medicine-doctors-with-histories.html\">identified </a>a doctor who allegedly caused the wrongful death of a local woman. Before printing the story, the reporter received a <a href=\"http://media.kansascity.com/smedia/2011/09/13/18/27/4IvBI.So.81.pdf\">letter</a> from the agency threatening fines of $11,000 per offense for revealing the doctor&#39;s identity.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe physician names are redacted in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, which protects personally identifiable information collected by federal agencies. But the 1986 law that created the file stipulates that as long as the individuals can&#39;t be identified, the information must be given out if requested.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked if the file will be put online again, Kramer said, &quot;There will be information online. It will be available as quickly as possible.&quot; But he couldn&#39;t confirm that it will be available in the same form that it was previously, nor whether any additional information would be redacted. Kramer said that while the agency will provide &quot;as much information as we possibly can,&quot; staff are legally bound to ensure that doctors can&#39;t be identified.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReporters&#39; groups and consumer advocates issued letters and statements last week protesting the decision. Charles Ornstein, president of the Association of Health Care Journalists, <a href=\"http://www.healthjournalism.org/about-news-detail.php?id=126\">said</a> he was puzzled by the sudden withdrawal of the data that reporters had used so many times before.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInvestigative Reporters and Editors is making the&nbsp;<a href=\"\">data available onine</a>, and has joined the protest of the&nbsp;<a href=\"\">Association of Health Care Journalists</a>&nbsp;and the Society of Professional Journalists. IRE&#39;s data is current through August 2011.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Obama administration has repeatedly announced its commitment to the sharing of information online. President Obama released a <a href=\"http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-1777.pdf\">memorandum</a> calling for an Open Government Directive on his first day in office, which <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/open/raw\">launched</a> later that year, requiring each agency to make <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/data-gov-opinion/\">&quot;high value&quot; datasets</a> available on its website.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLisa McGiffert, director of the Consumers Union&#39;s <a href=\"http://safepatientproject.org\">Safe Patient Project</a>, said this information is vital to consumers. &quot;This database is really the only source of information about physicians&#39; discipline and medical malpractice history,&quot; she said. Without it, reporters looking for a national perspective or for doctors who move to different states after being sanctioned would have to go to each state agency individually--and the quality of the data varies from state to state.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor its part, the American Medical Association (AMA), the nation&#39;s largest physician trade <a href=\"http://www.ama-assn.org/\">group</a>, issued a statement &quot;welcoming&quot; the decision. According to the AMA, &quot;duplicate entries, inaccurate data, and inappropriate information in the NPDB provide, at best, an incomplete and haphazard indicator of a physician&rsquo;s competence or quality. Providing the public with unreliable or misleading information on physicians will encourage patients to make ill-informed decisions about their health care.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMcGiffert, however, thought patients would benefit from the data. &quot;The oversight of physicians, many of us believe, is inadequate,&quot; she said. &quot;Doctors who have repeated problems over time are not dealt with in a timely manner.&quot; McGiffert added that reporters are most likely to get onto the trail of a doctor with particularly egregious conduct. &quot;Those doctors who have a long enough rap sheet are easy to identify so we&#39;re talking about doctors who have a long history of problems,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t*--[<strong>Editor&#39;s note</strong>: In the original version of this story, this line continued to say that, &quot;...in fact, reporters are forbidden from publishing any names that they discover on their own accord.&quot; In fact, unlike many other federal health care data sets, including several Sunlight has requested, the NPDB public use file did not require users to agree in advance to restrictions in how they used the data. HRSA maintains that it is forbidden from releasing the data in a format that allows for the identification of doctors, and argued the entire database had to be removed because one doctor was identified. The Reportng Group regrets the error.]</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-09-20 10:09:12", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "consumer-groups-protest-disappearance-doctor-discipline-data", "tags": "data mine, accountability, NPDB, healthcare", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2467, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-09-19 14:24:02", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2011-09-19 12:15:33", "image": "", "title": "George B.

He turned a disastrous acquisition of an Oklahoma bank--which he approved as a director--into a billion dollar score, thanks in part to a taxpayer-financed bailout. His venture capital firms--owned by his tax exempt foundation--have offices in tax havens like Mauritius, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands. He has stakes in firms that drill for oil on federal lands, use fracking technologies to unlock natural gas, and a pair of solar energy firms that have received hundreds of millions in federal loan guarantees. He&#39;s George B. Kaiser, one of the 100 wealthiest men in America, and the Obama campaign bundler whose investment in Solyndra, the bankrupt solar energy firm that benefited from $535 million in federal loan guarantees has launched inquiries from Congress, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Inspector General of the Treasury Department.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Department of Energy approved Solyndra&#39;s loan deal in Sept. 2009, after Obama administration officials <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/obama-admin-reworked-solyndra-1182334.html\">hurried</a> career officials who expressed <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/emails-obama-white-house-monitored-huge-loan-connected/story?id=14508865&amp;singlePage=true\">reservations</a> about the company&#39;s soundness. In February 2011, the terms of the loan were restructured to ensure that private investors in Solyndra--including a firm called Argonaut Ventures I LLC--would be first in line to be reimbursed if the company&#39;s assets are liquidated. The majority owner of Argonaut Ventures is the George Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit set up by Kaiser, a Tulsa, Okla.-based banker, oil and gas man and philanthropist.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo date, much of the coverage of Solyndra has focused on <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-administration-e-mails-giving-more-taxpayer-money-to-solyndra-was-risky/2011/09/15/gIQAPacpVK_story.html\">administration efforts</a> ill-fated effort to bail out the company and its biggest investor. But beyond Kaiser&#39;s role as an Obama campaign bundler----the Tulsa World reported in March 2007 that the oilman hosted a fundraiser at his home for the candidate, where Obama raised about $250,000--little attention has been paid to the man who once told Forbes that the oil and gas business was the only one where one could &quot;legally steal.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition to Solyndra, the George Kaiser Family Foundation has an investment in SolarReserves Inc., which <a href=\"https://lpo.energy.gov/?projects=solarreserve-llc-crescent-dunes\">received a $737 million commitment</a> from the Energy Department in May 2011 from the same program as the ill-fated Solyndra to build a solar generation and storage facility in Nevada. Like Solyndra, Steve Mitchell, Argonaut&#39;s managing partner, <a href=\"http://www.solarreserve.com/aboutUs-BOARD-SteveMitchell.html\">sits</a> on the board of SolarReserves. But despite the investments in alternative energy, Kaiser&#39;s foundation is far more invested in the oil and gas industries.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSecurity and Exchange Commission filings show that, at the <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1265376/000095012309011730/c86502e13fvhr.txt\">end of the year in 2008</a>, the George Kaiser Family Foundation owned stakes worth $100 million or more in six oil and gas firms, including Anadarko Petroleum, EOG Resources and XTO Energy. Its <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1265376/000095012311073482/c21037e13fvhr.txt\">most recent ownership disclosure</a> with the SEC shows a $371 million investment in oil and gas firm Unit Corporation, a $205 million investment in Anadarko Petroleum and a $124 million stake in Petroleo Brasileiros, a Brazilian energy company.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat shouldn&#39;t be surprising. Kaiser&#39;s initial fortune came from oil and gas. When he took over his father&#39;s business, Kaiser-Francis Oil, in 1969, it had all of ten employees. The 1970s energy shocks that resulted in gas lines and natural gas shortages proved to be a boon for the domestic oil and gas industry, and Kaiser built his company up into Oklahoma&#39;s largest privately-held producer of natural gas. When energy prices started declining in the 1980s, plenty of domestic energy producers went bankrupt.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut not Kaiser. He acquired firms that went bankrupt--companies with names like Waterford Energy (which had $7 million in assets and $151 million in losses) and MGF Oil. For Kaiser, the acquisitions made sense--as Waterford&#39;s plan of reorganization, filed in a Texas bankruptcy court in 1990, made clear. One of the principal motivations of the plan was to &quot;preserve the tax attributes of the debtor in order to allow the debtor to realize the benefits of the tax attributes.&quot; Waterford&#39;s losses ended up lowering the tax bill of Kaiser&#39;s company.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 1997, the Internal Revenue Service disallowed the Waterford losses, sending Kaiser a bill for $24 million. Kaiser fought the IRS in U.S. Tax Court, ultimately settling the case for $3.7 million, or 15 cents on the dollar. Documents produced in the case showed that, from 1986 to 1992, his company--Kaiser-Francis Oil&#39;s parent, GBK Corporation--had filed returns from 1986 to 1992 claiming a net of $507,000 in losses. Yet during this same period, GBK Corporation had enough cash to loan Kaiser $100 million.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 1991, Kaiser bought the Bank of Oklahoma, an institution that had largely avoided making rash loans during the state&#39;s oil boom economy that led many other savings institutions--including savings and loans, 162 of which shut down during the crisis--from going broke. That is, until 1984, when the Bank of Oklahoma bought Fidelity Bank N.A., an Oklahoma City-based bank whose books were loaded with bad loans. Kaiser, who served on Bank of Oklahoma&#39;s board of directors at the time, favored the deal, but it didn&#39;t work out so well: after a second quarter loss of $51 million, the bank turned to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for a bailout. The FDIC deemed it essential to the state&#39;s economy, and rather than shut it down bailed it out the bank for $130 million. Five years later, after returning the bank to profitability, the FDIC sold it to Kaiser--for $61 million.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe deal was a profitable one--by 1998, his shares in the company were worth $917 million. Even more surprising, Kaiser bought the bank at a time when he filed tax returns showing his income to be negative $2.3 million. In 1990, the year he submitted his bid for the bank, he told the IRS his income was about negative $115,000. Kaiser&#39;s total income taxes paid those years: zero. From 1986 to 1991, Kaiser&#39;s reported personal income averaged negative $860,000 a year.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe IRS audited Kaiser, and in 1997 sent him a bill for $48.6 million in back taxes, interest and penalties. Kaiser went to Tax Court again, and fared even better. He settled with the IRS for $11,891. The IRS had claimed that the $100 million he&#39;d received from his company, GBK Corporation, was dividend income, not a loan. Kaiser argued that he was paying back the amount--and was even able to deduct the interest paid on the loan from his personal income tax return.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterviewed a few years after settling with the IRS, Kaiser explained his success by saying, &quot;There was no issue. The Internal Revenue Service on occasion will raise spurious issues to increase its leverage.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKaiser still owns the Bank of Oklahoma--its <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/875357/000087535711000010/proxy.htm\">most recent proxy statement</a> notes that, &quot;George B. Kaiser currently owns approximately 60.4% of the outstanding common stock and plans to vote in person at the meeting&quot; He&#39;s also continues play a prominent role in the nonprofit foundation that bears his name--its most recent Form 990 notes calls him &quot;a substantial contributor the George Kaiser Family Foundation.&quot; What percentage of the foundation&#39;s tax deductible gifts he&#39;s given is uncertain, but since the year 2000, the average amount of donations received has been $325 million a year.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs the Solyndra, SolarReserves and oil and gas investments attest, the foundation is also an active investor. In its 2009 tax return with the IRS, the foundation notes, &quot;&hellip;all investments are reviewed, both at the time the investment is made and as part of ongoing monitoring, to ensure the legality of the investment and the effect such an investment might have on the foundation&#39;s tax exempt status. The directors are very familiar with the requirements for tax-exempt status&hellip;&quot; Kaiser is one of the directors, but the 990 cites two attorneys who serve on the board and &quot;are well qualified to make these assessments.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAmong the investment vehicles the foundation uses are a number located in tax haven countries: GKFF Limited in Gibraltar, Argonaut Ventures in Mauritius and Enterprise Venture Fund LP, which lists its address as <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/raising-their-ugland-house-cayman-islands-lobbies-to-keep-haven/\">Ugland House</a> in the Cayman Islands.

The group is in talks with DC Vote for one project, he said, and worked with three social and employment justice groups for another.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn August, the Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/virginia-politics/post/labor-backed-group-hits-frank-wolf-on-st-elizabeths-funding/2011/08/12/gIQAb0nOBJ_blog.html\">first reported</a> on some of the group&rsquo;s ties. A story about Our DC&rsquo;s protests at the offices of Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., said the group was backed by labor, received seed money from the SEIU and shared an office with the union. Adams confirmed that in a second interview, but said the group had plans to move to a separate office on Martin Luther King Junior Avenue.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn closer inspection, however, the union links go deeper. Kendall Fells, identified by Our DC as an executive director, was listed last year by SEIU&rsquo;s DC headquarters as an organizing coordinator, drawing an SEIU paycheck, in documents <a href=\"http://unionreports.gov/\">filed</a> with the Labor Department. When this reporter asked for Fells at SEIU Organizing&#39;s listed phone number earlier this week, he was transferred to an extension, and after several rings, a recorded message thanked him for calling Our DC. Yesterday within the space of a few hours, &ldquo;Kendall Fells, OurDC.org,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kendall Fells, SEIU,&rdquo; sent two separate emails both titled &ldquo;Call Mayor Gray: Demand Mayor Gray Enforce the Living Wage Law&rdquo; to a list for Our DC supporters.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img alt=\"An e-mail alert from Kendall Fells\" src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/kendall-fells-action-alert-wide.png\" style=\"width: 580px; height: 419px\" /></p>\r\n<div style=\"font-size:90%\">\r\n\tThis email alert, urging recipients to call DC Mayor Vincent Gray, was sent to this reporter from &quot;Kendall Fells, OurDC.org&quot; and &quot;Kendall Fells, SEIU.&quot;</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;Kendall works for Our DC,&rdquo; Adams said when asked about Fells&rsquo; current employer.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOther links indicate the closeness of the rest of the group. For example: the HTML source code for Our DC&rsquo;s website is littered with references to the SEIU (13 refences on the front page); many of the photos on the group&rsquo;s Flickr account are credited to an SEIU photographer; and the name of an Our DC organizer quoted in <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/09/the-supercommittee-meets-niceties-shouting-and-business-as-usual/244749/\">The Atlantic&rsquo;s account</a> of the Super Committee protest, Valerie Bachelor, also shows up in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://cqrollcall.photoshelter.com/image/I0000St_bCCkoj0M\">caption of a photo</a> taken in August by CQ Roll Call: she&#39;s identified as an SEIU political assistant, sitting in the union&#39;s war room for health care and jobs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition to SEIU Locals 1 and 615, a slew of similar websites share the Our DC website IP address, including <a href=\"http://fightforphilly.org/\">Fight for Philly</a>, <a href=\"http://goodjobshouston.org/\">Good Jobs Great Houston</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mnfaireconomy.org/\">Minnesotans for a Fair Economy</a>, <a href=\"http://onepittsburgh.org/\">One Pittsburgh</a>, and <a href=\"http://ourfuturemontgomery.org/\">Our Future Montgomery</a>. The websites share similar design elements and advocate for similar goals. Several of those groups disclose SEIU as a coalition member, but others say only that labor groups are involved.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe &quot;Call Mayor Gray&quot; campaign illustrates why groups without clear SEIU affiliation could be useful to a union representing service employees, many of whom work in the health care field. The email, introducing an Our DC campaign demanding the city to enforce a law guaranting living wages, cites health care workers as a group effected by lax enforcement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe SEIU has also&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.seiu.org/2011/04/protect-medicare-dont-let-republicans-pull-the-woo.php\">been vocal</a> in their efforts to protect Medicare, a possible source of cuts for the Super Committee. And the SEIU has long supported Obama politically, with <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/09/09/service-employees-international-union-seiu-backs-american-jobs-act\">support</a> for the American Jobs Act another example.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;We had 100 people at the [Boehner speech], the vast majority of them unemployed or under-employed, and that&#39;s who we represent,&rdquo; said Adams in response to the idea that the group represents the SEIU.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn an <a href=\"http://kpft.org/wpfw_archive/mp3/wpfw_110908_093008metrowaiminott.mp3\">episode</a> of DC radio program Metro Watch, aired August 8 on WPFW, Fells, the executive director,&nbsp;said his group wants to bring some of the misery of joblessness to congressional Republicans and other members of Congress who weren&#39;t telling corporations to pay a fair share of taxes or to give people jobs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe identified Reps. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., Wolf, and Cantor as Congressmen that had yet to respond to Our DC&rsquo;s attempts to reach them through their offices, and he outlined a strategy to get through: &ldquo;When you start having block captains and rapid response members that are every single place that they are? That they can&rsquo;t get any sleep, because every time they look in the rear view mirror, we&rsquo;re there? Oh, I think they&rsquo;re going to get the message.&rdquo;</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-09-16 12:03:47", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "super-committee-protest-was-organized-seiu-linked-group", "tags": "Health care reform, health care, Jobs, super committee, Supercongress, supercommittee, ", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2463, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-09-16 10:23:46", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 27, "timestamp": "2011-09-15 10:28:04", "image": "", "title": "How do lobbyists snag front-row seats at hearings?", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tAs the 12 members of the &ldquo;super committee&rdquo; scour the nation&rsquo;s budget searching for at least $1.2 trillion in federal cuts, Washington lobbyists are watching their every move, hoping to protect the interests of their clients.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome attend <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/supercommittee/\">fundraisers</a>, ponying up as much as $1,000, $2,000 or $5,000 for face time with a member.

The position limits rule received one of the highest number of public comments in the agency&#39;s history. Advocates for the rule argue that excessive speculation in markets dealing with everyday consumer goods can drive up the cost of gas and food.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile considering the rule, agency officials <a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/Rulemakings/DF_26_PosLimits/index.htm\">held</a> 161 meetings with outside groups.

These groups, however, apparently did not orchestrate comment-writing campaigns. In fact, the overwhelming majority of comment letters sent to the agency were in favor of tough position limits.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Sunlight Foundation analyzed the comment letters using a new tool in development by Sunlight Labs. The tool helps identify documents that contain similar or identical language and should be ready for public release soon. The research showed:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;More than 6,050 public comments came from a <a href=\"http://www.stopoilspeculationnow.com/Pages/action.aspx\">form letter</a> distributed by a group called <a href=\"http://www.stopoilspeculationnow.com/home.aspx\">Stop Oil Speculation Now</a>, which is <a href=\"http://www.stopoilspeculationnow.com/Pages/aboutus.aspx\">backed</a> by the airline and petroleum marketing industries. The letter states: &ldquo;Time is of the essence, and I urge you to act quickly. Our pocketbooks and the broader economy depend on it.&rdquo; The contact organization for the coalition is the Air Transport Association, which has <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000545&amp;year=2011\">reported</a> spending $1.8 million on lobbying so far this year on a host of issues.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;More than 2,230 comments came from a letter started by silver market analyst <a href=\"http://www.butlerresearch.com/index.asp\">Ted Butler</a>. He argues that the position limits on silver in the new regulation still are not stringent enough. In the <a href=\"http://news.silverseek.com/SilverSeek/1298557244.php\">form letters</a> originally written by Butler, those leaving public comment ask: &ldquo;Please institute a 1,500 contract (7.5 million ounce) position limit for silver.&rdquo; Another 182 comments also ask for Butler&#39;s stricter limits for silver at 1,500 contracts or 7.5 ounces, but the form letter is worded differently.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At least 802 comments were modeled after a form letter distributed by <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:drNdMiHKcdoJ:ourfinancialsecurity.org/+americans+for+financial+reform&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=www.google.com\">Americans for Financial Reform</a>, a broad coalition that includes consumer groups such as <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000044738&amp;year=2007\">Center for Responsible Lending</a> and <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000049701&amp;year=2011\">Consumers Union</a> as well as union lobbying powerhouses including the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000088&amp;year=2011\">AFL-CIO</a> and <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000061&amp;year=2011\">AFSCME</a>.

This group&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wdm.org.uk/blog/stop-wall-street-undermining-food-speculation-rules\">form letter</a>&nbsp;states that&nbsp;&quot;while many factors contribute to today&#39;s highly volatile commodity prices, it is clear that excessive speculation is partially responsible.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At least 80 comments came from the student-led advocacy group <a href=\"http://www.aidemocracy.org/\">Americans for Informed Democracy</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.aidemocracy.org/students/st-patrick%E2%80%99s-day-stop-gambling-green-on-grain/\">group&#39;s site</a> directs users to a form letter posted on&nbsp;the website Democracy in Action, an e-advocacy site that small and medium-sized nonprofits can use to further their causes. That form letter stated: &ldquo;As an American citizen, I think that regulating the excessive speculation on commodity markets is incredibly important in making market prices less volatile.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe CFTC gave the comment letters to the Sunlight Foundation in electronic format. There were 11,858 letters in all that the agency had received at that time. While the comment letter period officially ended in March, the agency has continued to accept letters. The analysis covers 90 percent of the letters that the agency has received as of September 8.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe airline industry would have something to gain from this particular Dodd-Frank rule, said David Berg of the Air Transport Association, which is associated with Stop Oil Speculation Now.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Jet fuel is the single largest cost component for jet liners,&rdquo; Berg said. &ldquo;High oil prices drive high fuel prices. That&#39;s one reason why we are interested. More germane here is that most airlines engage in hedging programs and hedging is done to reduce the risk of high jet fuel prices.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSpeculation can increase the volatility of the market, and that affects an airline&#39;s ability to hedge because the risk is too great, Berg said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&ldquo;Speculation in and of itself if not bad,&rdquo; Berg said. There was one time when the balance of speculators and hedgers were 30 percent and 70 percent, respectively. Those numbers have flipped so that speculation now makes up about 60 to 70 percent of the market, he added.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStop Oil Speculation Now is comprised of 98 members, which are listed on the group&#39;s website. Those members are almost&nbsp;entirely&nbsp;petroleum marketing and airline industry groups.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tButler, the silver market analyst, has been advocating for stricter position limits for the past 20 years, he says.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;I ran no big campaign to get folks to write in &ndash; this was it,&rdquo; Butler said in an email, linking to the form letter he put on his website. Seeing the number of people who submitted comments based on his letter &ldquo;was impressive,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tButler owns Butler Research LLC, and runs a website with information on the precious metals market that members pay a subscription to access. According to the website, Butler Research provides &ldquo;fundamental and expert analysis of the gold and silver markets.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen an agency proposes a rule, the public is invited to comment. In recent years, some groups have become experts in flooding the agencies with comments about controversial rules, by providing sample letters on the Internet and encouraging people to send in similar letters. The groups can be citizen organizations soliciting assistance from their supporters, but often they are backed by big monied interests.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn June, the Administrative Conference of the United States <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-08-09/html/2011-20138.htm\">recommended</a> that agencies should consider using content analysis software to &quot;reduce the need for agency staff to spend time reading identical or nearly identical comments.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"1200\" scrolling=\"NO\" src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/reporting/clustering/clusteringTool.html\" width=\"580\"></iframe></p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-09-14 10:40:48", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "position-limits", "tags": "CFTC, Dodd-Frank", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2461, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-09-13 15:46:07", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 4, "timestamp": "2011-09-12 16:46:56", "image": "", "title": "bank of america", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tBank of America, the troubled mega-bank that recently announced thousands of job cuts, has plenty of capital invested in Washington in the form of campaign contributions and lobbying.

The Federal Reserve still has not released data on all of its emergency lending programs.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe Federal Reserve loaned the bank $91.4 billion from 2007 through 2009 through a variety of emergency lending programs, according to analysis by Bloomberg News. These included the &quot;discount window,&quot; which the Federal Reserve made public only after Bloomberg News brought a lawsuit and the Supreme Court ruled in the news organization&#39;s failure, plus an alphabet soup of programs such as the Term Auction Facility and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tFor example, the bank also benefitted from $2.83 billion&nbsp; from a Federal Reserve lending program known as TALF, or the <span class=\"st\">Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, as the Sunlight Foundation&#39;s Ryan Sibley previously <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2010/12/13/nations-biggest-banks-benefit-most-from-fed-program/\">reported</a>.</span></li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tBank of America also received a total of <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/briefing-room/reports/tarp-transactions/DocumentsTARPTransactions/9-8-11%20Transactions%20Report%20as%20of%209-7-11_INVESTMENT.pdf\">$45 billion</a> through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), all of which has been repayed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPressure could also be on members of the super committee to avoid closing tax loopholes that benefit companies like Bank of America. For example, the bank is one of the top donors to super committee member Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R., Texas. As Bill Allison reported <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/big-donors-super-committee-members-have-stake-outcome/\">here</a>, The bank has <a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=AB0D30CC-051A-420C-9B37-943228BDDF91\">disclosed lobbying</a> on a <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h749/show\">House bill</a> that would permanently exempt from taxation some foreign earnings of corporations.

Those interests might come into play as the members of the super committee craft $1.5 trillion in debt reduction measures--spending cuts, revenue increases, or both--that can win a majority of their votes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe went through the most recent lobbying disclosures for each of the top five donors to the three Democratic House members of the super committee, all appointed by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and highlighted one or two issues that might come up as the members consider ways to cut spending, raise revenues--or both. Not every big donor had an identifiable interest that might figure in the committee&#39;s work, but these filings were made before the bill that authorized setting up the super committee had been passed into law.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwo of the labor unions among the top donors, the United Auto Workers and the International Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union, lobbied for continued Defense Department spending; the latter, a top donor to Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., also lobbied for full funding for a replacement for NASA&#39;s space shuttle program. Those priorities differed from another top Clyburn career donor--the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or AFSCME. That union lobbied against cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, two programs that train and benefit nurses, and other domestic spending.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLobbying disclosures for large organizations can list dozens or even hundreds of bills and issues that they try to influence or monitor, and the big donors to super committee members are no exception. The companies, trade groups, universities, labor unions and other organizations whose political action committees, employees and their family members have contributed the most to the dozen members charged with addressing the nation&#39;s debt lobby on a wide range of issues.

Its lobbying disclosures list numerous bills with tax consequences that the company is following, ranging from a bill that would exempt repatriated offshore earnings from federal corporate income taxes to measures that would extend research and development tax breaks or change taxes on telephone service providers.

AT&amp;T is also following a bill that would repeal a not yet enacted provision of a 2006 law, the&nbsp;Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act, that would require federal agencies, state and local governments with expenditures of more than $100 million to <a href=\"http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0211/020111rb1.htm\">withhold taxes amounting to 3 percent</a>&nbsp;of the payments they make to outside vendors of goods and services costing more than $10,000.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<b>American Association for Justice:</b> The trade group for trial attorneys--who generally charge their clients nothing while representing them, instead sharing whatever monetary awards they win from defendants--is <a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=CE368E5F-AA30-4AE3-BFF4-3881417C9978\">lobbying</a> for tax changes that would allow expenses and court costs paid by attorneys in contingency cases to be tax deductible.

Clyburn &ldquo;has clearly stated his priorities for achieving fairness through the process by utilizing a combination of job creation, spending cuts, and revenue raisers. He considers that nothing is off the table, and believes any specific programmatic proposals should be discussed directly with committee members during their negotiations.&quot;</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p2\">\r\n\t\t\tOne of the many lobbyists that is well positioned to make those proposals is Jaime Harrison, a young, &ldquo;rising star of the Democratic party,&rdquo; according to his Podesta Group bio, who worked for the South Carolina legislator from 2003 to 2008. That tenure included time as Clyburn&rsquo;s floor director, one of his most senior aides, while he was Majority Whip.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p2\">\r\n\t\t\tNow Harrison represents companies in virtually every sector of the economy, including defense firms such as Boeing and General Dynamics&mdash;two of the four largest recipients of <a href=\"http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/defense_ethics/resource_library/dod_top_100_fy2010.pdf\">Pentagon contracts</a>&mdash;and oil and gas giant BP. The contractors would be hurt if the committee cannot come to an agreement by Thanksgiving, triggering a cut of up to $600 billion to defense spending over 10 years. Oil industry lobbyists will be <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Deficit-panel-may-aim-at-oil-tax-breaks-2156548.php\">pressing</a> committee members to preserve their special tax benefits.</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\t\t\tHarrison also represents the National Association of Broadcasters, which also sent its lobbyist, Mike Mullen, to golf at the event and has sponsored the tournament for at least the past five years, NAB executive vice president Dennis Wharton said. The NAB will be lobbying the deficit panel against the Federal Communication Commission&rsquo;s plan to auction off spectrum currently used by local broadcasters, Wharton said. But he maintained that the lobbying has nothing to do with donating to Clyburn&rsquo;s charity and pointed out the Clyburn&rsquo;s appointment came after the tournament.</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\t\t\tSince leaving Clyburn&rsquo;s office in late 2008, Harrison has contributed $3,400 to Clyburn&#39;s campaign, more than any other lobbyist identified on the list of golfers, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Employees of the prestigious Podesta Group were Clyburn&rsquo;s fifth-largest source of campaign contributions in 2010, according to <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2010&amp;cid=N00002408&amp;type=I\">CRP</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\t\t\tHarrison, like many other lobbyists on the list of golfers, did not return an email asking about his relationship with the congressman and if he plans to lobby the super committee.</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p2\">\r\n\t\t\tOf all the industries represented in Santee, the pharmaceutical industry may have made the biggest splash, with five companies snagging <a href=\"http://canzaterclassic.com/2011-sponsors\">sponsorships</a> worth at least $10,000. A dozen industry lobbyists, including Amgen&rsquo;s Chaka Burgess, Jesse Price of Eli Lilly and Chris Porter of Novo Nordisk all planned to tie off. Burgess sits on the board of the <a href=\"http://www.cbcfinc.org/about-cbcf/board-of-directors.html\">Congressional Black Caucus Foundation</a> with Clyburn&rsquo;s chief of staff, Yelberton Watkins, who also golfed at the charity event. Amgen was a $5,000 sponsor of the tournament, and its PAC was one of the many health care industry PACs that maxed-out with a $10,000 contributions to Clyburn&rsquo;s campaign for the 2010 election.</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\t\t\tAll three companies are members of industry trade group PhRMA, a $20,000 tournament sponsor, which <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/many-members-of-debt-supercommittee-have-ties-to-lobbyists/2011/08/23/gIQANiLr4J_story_1.html\">opposes a proposal</a> to allow the government to negotiate with companies over Medicare prescription drug prices (known as Medicare Part D). Burgess has already been lobbying on the issue this year, <a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=76ADDBB6-2FE5-4E1B-B813-D1F3692B5457\">filings show</a>.</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\t\t\tAnother lobbyist on the list of golfers is Microsoft&rsquo;s lead congressional advocate, Matt Gelman, one of The Hill newspaper&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/4071-top-lobbyists-corporate\">top corporate lobbyists</a> in 2009. Gelman briefly took a leave of absence to serve as a senior advisor to Clyburn in 2007. He contributed $500 to Clyburn&rsquo;s campaign a decade ago, and $500 to his leadership PAC last year. A spokesperson for Microsoft declined to comment for this article.</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\t\t\tAt the tournament, Microsoft and Dell were the event&rsquo;s top sponsors, donating software and laptops to students receiving scholarships. Last year, the value of those donations <a href=\"http://thetandd.com/news/local/article_41d251dc-a3fc-11df-896b-001cc4c002e0.html\">exceeded $200,000</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\t\t\tTwo influential lobbyists for AT&amp;T also golfed at the event. One is Clyburn&rsquo;s cousin William Clyburn, who runs Clyburn Consulting, LLC, and was put on the same team as Watkins, Clyburn&rsquo;s chief of staff, at the tournament. He also lobbies for the US Telecom Association and the American Public Transportation Association.</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\t\t\tThe other is in-house AT&amp;T lobbyist Lyndon Boozer, who contributes to many Democratic candidates and <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Host/boozer/\">hosts Washington, D.C. fundraisers</a> for them. Boozer gave $500 to Clyburn&rsquo;s campaign in 2008, according to the CRP.</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\t\t\tAmong D.C. lobbyists, Boozer is not alone in his support of both Clyburn&rsquo;s charity and his re-election effort. Another lobbyist golfer, <a href=\"http://www.sewardsquare.com/lobbyists/james-jamie-pericola.html\">Jaime Pericola</a> of the Seward Square Group, also helps Clyburn fundraise in Washington, he said, and has sent $1,000 to the Assistant Democratic Leader&#39;s campaign over the years.</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\t\t\t&ldquo;[Clyburn] provides real scholarships for kids in need. He is by far one of the best public servants I&rsquo;ve seen in my time in Washington,&rdquo; Pericola said.</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\t\t\tPericola said he is not sure how he will lobby the super committee.</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\t\t\t&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s kind of a wait and see attitude for most people to see how much they&rsquo;re going to get done,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\t\t\tHarrison, Clyburn&rsquo;s former lead aide, also helps his former boss raise campaign cash, according to a report in <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/issues/55_146/-47250-1.html\">Roll Call</a>. Last year, he sent out an e-mail to his K Street colleagues asking them to attend upcoming &ldquo;Fundraisers with Jaime,&rdquo; including Clyburn&rsquo;s annual barbecue event.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\t\t\tAnother D.C. insider who showers money on Democrats, <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Host/berzok/\">Matthew Berzok</a>, a partner at Ryan, McKinnon, et al, also golfed at the event. Berzok, who has donated $2,000 to Clyburn over the years, represents clients across many sectors, including many companies and associations who sponsored the golf event: the Association of American Railroads, Novo Nordisk and tobacco company Altria. He also represents the Edison Electric Institute, the main trade group representing electric utilities in Washington.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-09-08 14:10:30", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "lobbyists-close-to-clyburn", "tags": "Super Committee, Rep.

He also supported President Bush&rsquo;s Medicare prescription drug plan, one of a minority of Democrats to vote for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSen. Pat Toomey, R., Penn., comes across as a bit of a maverick. As a member of the House, he voted against Bush&rsquo;s Medicare drug plan, one of just 25 GOP members to do so. He&rsquo;s also the only Republican member of the super committee who voted against the continuing resolution last April that averted a government shut down.

He also voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; on both April&rsquo;s continuing resolution and the summer debt ceiling vote. His &ldquo;no&rdquo; streak also marks him as the only House member of the super committee to vote against this year&rsquo;s defense spending bill. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D., S.C., joined Becerra in voting against April&rsquo;s continuing resolution but was a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on the debt ceiling vote. Rep.

Already, a preview of the speech shows proposals consistent with the positions of influential groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO. Both groups have spent millions to influence elections and policies. With that in mind, the Sunlight Foundation will cover the speech with live video, data and commentary at <a href=\"http://sunlightlive.com\">sunlightlive.com</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome of the glimpses into Obama&#39;s plan were provided by the president himself during a Labor Day speech in Detroit. Obama said he would seek to rebuild infrastructure, open up markets and extend some tax cuts, the setting framing all three ideas as being in line with labor&#39;s desires.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;If you want to know who helped lay [the] cornerstones of an American middle class,&rdquo; he said, while standing in front of supporters in bright-colored AFL-CIO-affiliated union shirts, &ldquo;you just have to look for the union label.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt the same time, Obama seemed to moderate his tone to appeal to business groups. Several ideas he previewed had as much in common with a jobs plan released that day by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as it did with union positions.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn his Monday speech, Obama promised to expand on three proposals when he speaks to Congress:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Rebuild Infrastructure</strong> - Obama cited this as an issue on which labor and business can agree, and it appears that they do. The Chamber supports building infrastructure would benefit from construction spending. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who spoke before Obama at the event on Monday, has had more than 60 scheduled appointments on White House grounds, according to <a href=\"http://opendata.socrata.com/Government/Trumka-Visits/2bck-q9uf\">White House records</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>&ldquo;Open Up New Markets&rdquo;</strong> - This phrase, used by Obama with little explanation in the Labor Day speech, has been used to promote free trade agreements stalled by Congress. The Chamber supports the agreements; the unions, less so. The AFL-CIO has said it has &quot;grave concerns&quot; over a proposed Korean free trade pact, unless labor rights and American jobs are better protected. Korea itself has been lobbying heavily on this issue, foreign agent registration <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/client/Embassy%20Of%20Korea%2C%20The%20Korean%20Government/\">records show</a>. Lobbyists working on behalf of the Korean government held scores of meetings with decision makers on the free trade agreement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Extend Middle Class Payroll Tax Cuts</strong> - The Chamber&rsquo;s plan recommends a one-time tax break for companies returning overseas profits &mdash; known as a repatriation holiday &mdash; and a break on capital gains taxes, but it probably won&rsquo;t argue with a middle class tax cut. The AFL-CIO may not benefit directly from the cuts, but its members do.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnother measure, which the president didn&rsquo;t mention on Monday, but that the White House supports, may also make an appearance on Thursday:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Re-Authorize the FAA</strong> - Along with infrastructure spending, the White House has been pushing Congress to fully re-authorize the FAA. The AFL-CIO and the Chamber both support this. Getting the Chamber&rsquo;s support, or at least avoiding their ire, could be useful to Obama and other Democrats. In the 2010 cycle, the Chamber contributed or spent $33 million, according to <a href=\"http://transparencydata.com/contributions/#Y3ljbGU9MjAxMCZ0cmFuc2FjdGlvbl9uYW1lc3BhY2U9dXJuJTNBZmVjJTNBdHJhbnNhY3Rpb24mb3JnYW5pemF0aW9uX2Z0PXVzJTIwY2hhbWJlciUyMG9mJTIwY29tbWVyY2U=\">data provided</a> by the Center for Responsive Politics. Almost all of that sum was <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/outside-spending/2010/committee/us-chamber-of-commerce\">spent</a> on electioneering communications, often eleventh-hour television attack ads.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tObama will likely encounter opposition from the Tea Party and other like-minded groups, including Americans for Prosperity (AFP), which would prefer lower taxes and fewer government programs. AFP spent or contributed $1.5 million in the 2010 cycle, much of it <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/outside-spending/2010/committee/americans-for-prosperity\">on electioneering ads</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, tune in at 7 p.m. Thursday as we cover the speech &mdash; and the influencers behind the scenes &mdash; live on <a href=\"http://sunlightlive.com\">sunlightlive.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-09-07 12:40:43", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "sunlight-live-cover-hidden-influence-obama-jobs-address", "tags": "AFL-CIO,chamber of commerce, sunlightlive, Sunlight Live, Congress, obama, Obama Administration, Barack Obama, ", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2454, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-09-07 13:45:19", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 28, "timestamp": "2011-09-07 11:01:48", "image": "", "title": "Sunlight Live to cover first \"Supercommittee\" hearing", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tAfter a quick summer recess, Congress returned this week with the newly formed &ldquo;Supercommittee&rdquo; scheduled to hold its first debt reduction meeting this Thursday at 10:30 a.m. EST.

Other top donors include a hedge fund run by a top Republican donor that invests in, among other things, defaulted debt of sovereign nations, corporations trying to shield income earned overseas from U.S. taxes, and utility firms seeking to avoid regulation of greenhouse gases.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs we noted in our previous posts on the <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/big-donors-super-committee-members-have-stake-outcome/\">three House Republicans</a> and the <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/donors-super-committee-senate-dems-lobby-tax-breaks-federal-fund/\">three Senate Democrats</a> on the super committee, the dozen members of the Joint Select Committee on Debt Reduction all have private interests backing them who are far more concerned with their own bottom lines than they are with broad public policy. Those interests might come into play as the members of the super committee craft $1.5 trillion in debt reduction measures--spending cuts, revenue increases, or both--that can win a majority of their votes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe went through the most recent lobbying disclosures for each of the top five donors to the three Republian Senate members of the super committee, all appointed by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and highlighted one or two issues that might come up as the members consider ways to cut spending, raise revenues--or both. Not every big donor had an identifiable interest that might figure in the committee&#39;s work, but these filings were made before the bill that authorized the Joint Select Committee on Debt Reduction had been passed into law.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLobbying disclosures for large organizations can list dozens or even hundreds of bills and issues that they try to influence or monitor, and the big donors to super committee members are no exception. The companies, trade groups, universities, labor unions and other organizations whose political action committees, employees and their family members have contributed the most to the dozen members charged with addressing the nation&#39;s debt lobby on a wide range of issues. Here are a few:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.:</b> His third term will be his last: Kyl, the minority whip, is retiring at the end the current Congress. He also serves on the Senate Finance and Judiciary Committees. Over the course of his career, his <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=Career&amp;type=I&amp;cid=N00006406&amp;newMem=N&amp;recs=20\">top donors</a>, according to the Center for Responsive Politics,&nbsp;are the Club for Growth (nearly all of the donations came in Kyl&#39;s last reelection effort), law firm Snell &amp; Wilmer, marketing and tourism firm Viad Corp., utility owner Pinnacle West Capital Corp. and Citigroup.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<b>Club for Growth:</b> Like Emily&#39;s List, the Club for Growth contributes to candidates who fit the profile of their ideological interests, but there the similarities end. Kyl&#39;s fellow super committee member Toomey (see profile below) served as the Club&#39;s president. The organization has a <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/outside-spending/2010/committee/club-for-growth-action\">Super PAC, Club for Growth Action</a> that was active in the 2010 elections, spending more than $4.9 million to influence races, as well as a <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00432260\">traditional political action committee</a> that contributes to federal candidates. Club donors also contribute to candidates directly. The Club for Growth does not actively lobby Congress, but its website lists several of the organization&#39;s priorities, <a href=\"http://www.clubforgrowth.org/philosophy/\">many of which involve lowering taxes</a>. The organization favors permanently extending all of the reduced income tax rates passed during the Bush administration and extended until 2012 by President Obama (the two year extension alone will cost more than $186 billion, according to the <a href=\"http://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=3715\">Joint Committee on Taxation</a>, lowering or eliminating the capital gains tax (the two year cut to capital gains taxes set to expire in 2012 reduces federal revenues by more than $25 billion), lowering or eliminating the taxes on dividends (the two year dividend rate cut costs more than $27 billion), and lowering or eliminating the corporate income tax rate (corporate income taxes are estimated to bring in a total of more than $527 billion in 2011 and 2012, according to the <a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/eop/2011/xls/ERP-2011-table80.xls\">Economic Report of the President</a>.) The Club also <a href=\"http://www.clubforgrowth.org/philosophy/?subsec=0&amp;id=19\">favors</a> eliminating the estate tax, which in 2009, according to the <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/10esesttaxsnap.pdf\">Internal Revenue Service</a>, raised $21 billion. In addition to cutting or eliminating taxes, the organization also <a href=\"http://www.clubforgrowth.org/philosophy/?subsec=0&amp;id=25\">advocates</a> reining in--or cutting--entitlement spending, freezing domestic discretionary spending, and eliminating, transferring to the states or privatizing some federal programs.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<b>Viad Corp.:</b> The company hasn&#39;t lobbied Congress since <a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=D0D84F4C-9B0B-40C2-8FA0-A50F98236B0B\">July 2005</a>.

In the same report, the company notes that the Obama administration and Congress have discussed lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rates--generally, such proposals are accompanied by discussions of closing loopholes that allow profitable companies to avoid taxes, The annual report states, &quot;While Citigroup may benefit in some respects from any decreases in these corporate tax rates, any reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate would result in a decrease to the value of Citi&#39;s DTAs, which could be significant.&quot; DTAs--deferred tax assets--include net operating losses, tax credits and other write-offs that the company can use in future years to offset its tax liability.

Those interests might come into play as the members of the super committee craft $1.5 trillion in debt reduction measures--spending cuts, revenue increases, or both--that can win a majority of their votes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor some interests, achieving a plan is critical--if the super committee fails to agree on a proposal by November 23, or if Congress rejects it, defense and discretionary domestic spending will be cut by $1.2 trillion over ten years. Others seek to avoid reforms to the tax system that would raise revenues by closing loopholes or seeking cuts from entitlement programs, neither of which would occur if the super committee fails to reach an agreement. Some lawmakers have top donors pushing in opposite directions.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tConsider super committee co-chair Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. Among her top donors is Boeing, a major Washington state employer and a major Pentagon contractor--some 43 percent of its income came from government contracts, according to its most recent annual report. Cuts in the Defense budget would mean cuts for Boeing. For Microsoft, another top Murray donor, cuts to discretionary spending could mean less funding for hospitals and doctors to purchase health information technology--which the Redmond, Wash.-based software company makes. On the other hand, Emily&#39;s List, a major donor to progressive women seeking office, has said preserving entitlements like Social Security and Medicare are key issues.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne Murray donor, the University of Washington, has already seen funding increase for a program it lobbies for. The Budget Control Act, which raised the debt ceiling and created the super committee, <a href=\"http://www.rules.house.gov/Media/file/PDF_112_1/S-627-Sec-by-Sec-Summary(1).pdf\">provided $13 billion for Pell Grants</a>, financial assistance for those earning undergraduate degrees.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe went through the most recent lobbying disclosures for each of the top five donors to the three Democratic Senate members of the super committee, all appointed by Majority Leader Harry Reid, and highlighted one or two issues that might come up as the members consider ways to cut spending, raise revenues--or both. Not every big donor had an identifiable interest that might figure in the committee&#39;s work, but these filings were made before the bill that authorized the Joint Select Committee on Debt Reduction had been passed into law.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLobbying disclosures for large organizations can list dozens or even hundreds of bills and issues that they try to influence or monitor, and the big donors to super committee members are no exception. The companies, trade groups, universities, labor unions and other organizations whose political action committees, employees and their family members have contributed the most to the dozen members charged with addressing the nation&#39;s debt lobby on a wide range of issues. Here are a few:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.:</b> Head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the fundraising committee for Senate Democrats, Murray is the co-chair, along with Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, of the super committee.

On its website, the organization says it has raised more than $85 million for candidates since 1985. Emily&#39;s List does not lobby Congress. In the blog on its website, it has expressed a preference for <a href=\"http://emilyslist.org/blog/women_in_congress_take_stand_for_women_everywhere/\">preserving entitlement programs</a>, including Medicare and Medicaid.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<b>Microsoft:</b> The Washington state-based software maker <a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=6C90CB12-01DE-4CA6-BEFE-61A719C06B59\">lobbied</a> on federal health information technology programs.

One of its biggest selling points was the idea that we could lower costs and improve care by encouraging doctors to band together and coordinate a patient&#39;s treatment. Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), as these groups of physicians are called, got a push forward in March when Medicare issued a <a href=\"http://www.ofr.gov/(X(1)S(aoughu3lyuvjoq0w5fs4azsg))/inspection.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1\">proposed rule</a> describing the incentives these organizations will receive if they lower costs while maintaining high quality care.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile ACOs can take many forms--not all of which involve doctors working together for a hospital--employing doctors is increasingly seen as a way to prepare for the change.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.hschange.com/CONTENT/1230/1230.pdf\">study</a>, released Aug. 18 by the Center for Studying Health System Change, found that costs can be higher because physicians are often pressured by hospital employers to increase the volume of procedures they perform. Hospitals that employ most of the physicians in town can also negotiate for higher prices from insurance companies, and often charge doctors facility fees that are then passed on to patients and insurers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDr. Melissa Walton-Shirley, a cardiologist in Glasgow, Ken., works in private practice, but many of her colleagues work for hospitals. She said doctors at some hospitals work on a point system: the more productive they are, the more points they accumulate, which translates to more dollars earned by the hospital.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you&#39;re not able to make [enough points], you may feel pressure to do more procedures, do more tests, and see more patients,&quot; said Walton-Shirley. She hastened to add that not all doctors who work for hospitals are in the same boat; salaried physicians, for example, may feel less pressure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDr. Ann O&#39;Malley, one of the authors of the study, said the problem is that physicians in this country are currently paid by the procedure or visit. &quot;Right now payment for services in this country has nothing at all to do with whether these services are effective,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccountable Care Organizations were conceived as a way to address this problem, by rewarding quality rather than quantity. O&#39;Malley said they may do so, but the key is getting the doctors involved to truly work together--and making sure that they aren&#39;t being rewarded for the number of procedures they perform.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut changing the way we pay for our entire health care system is no easy task.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;How we move to a different payment method is not clear right now,&quot; said O&#39;Malley. &quot;We don&#39;t want to be disruptive to patients. It&#39;s got to be an incremental process.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDr. David Goodman, one of the principal investigators at the <a href=\"http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/\">Dartmouth Atlas</a>, which was instrumental in developing and popularizing the accountable care concept, agrees that if change came too quickly it would be devastating to some institutions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA lot of hospitals in New Jersey, Goodman said, spend a lot on health care and receive relatively poor marks on quality. At the other end of the spectrum are places like the Mayo Clinic, heralded for its excellent low-cost care.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If a hospital in New Jersey were to suddenly start behaving like the Mayo Clinic, they would be bankrupt next year,&quot; said Goodman. &quot;They&#39;ve built their organization in response to where the institutional rewards are.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA hospital might need to hire a battery of nurse practitioners to call chronically ill patients and make sure they are taking their pills, for instance, and cut back on expensive spine surgeries that are of questionable use.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccountable Care Organizations were envisioned as a way to soften the landing for hospitals looking to make these changes, which can be expensive in the short run. But to work well, doctors will have to work closely with hospitals--in many cases, as employees, according to Goodman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s hard to imagine a well-functioning ACO without very strong formal ties between the medical staff and hospitals,&quot; Goodman said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhether employing doctors turns out to be an efficiency godsend or a cost headache may differ wildly depending on the environment and the motivations of the individual hospitals and physicians involved. These accountable care groups are still largely untested--only a few pilot projects and test cases already exist--but at the rate the health care landscape is changing, their mettle will likely be tested soon enough.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-08-29 11:43:27", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "shrinking-private-practice-may-drive-up-health-care-costs-study", "tags": "health care, medicare, aco, accountable care", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2445, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-08-26 12:17:18", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 22, "timestamp": "2011-08-26 09:14:11", "image": "", "title": "Canadian government, oil interests keep close watch on oil pipeline verdict", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tEnvironmental protesters gathered Wednesday in front of the White House calling to stop the extension of a crude oil pipeline, from the midwest to the Gulf coast ahead of a State deparment environmental study due to come out today.

Last May, Canadians <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/business/energy-environment/07pipeline.html\">reelected conservatives</a> with a history of promoting the oil sands industry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnother well-connected partner at Nelson Mullins, <a href=\"http://www.nelsonmullins.com/attorneys/philip-lader\">Philip Lader</a> served as on President Clinton&rsquo;s Cabinet as the Administrator of the Small Business Administration.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.nelsonmullins.com/attorneys/leo-coco\">Leo Coco</a>, an attorney at Nelson Mullins, served as former chief of staff to former South Carolina Congressman Butler Derrick&nbsp; and <a href=\"http://www.nelsonmullins.com/attorneys/chris-cushing\">Chris Cushing</a> was a principal advisor to former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole in the 80s.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOil sands lobbying involves some other large players.

Its lobbying disclosures list numerous bills with tax consequences that the company is following, ranging from a bill that would exempt repatriated offshore earnings from federal corporate income taxes to measures that would extend research and development tax breaks or change taxes on telephone service providers.

That he did so with the aid of Western lobbyists, intellectuals and former heads of state is less well known.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile the public recalls <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i8dczPTHpeFKqN7TYeXGDgD54GYA?docId=67067a9dce124a9abb877a80d3e7a3d1\">Gaddafi</a> for Libya&rsquo;s role in the Lockerbie bombing, which killed 250 people, for his flamboyant costumes and bizarre statements, and dismantling his weapons of mass destruction program, his use of organizations like the <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/registrant/Livingston%20Group/\">Livingston Group</a> and the latter&rsquo;s client, the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation, is less well known.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tConsider the United Nations. The U.N.&rsquo;s close relations with Gaddafi have instigated criticism that the UN was enabling the regime. Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi, who has been captured by the rebel forces and has a warrant outstanding at the I<a href=\"http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099329.pdf\">was the president of the Gaddafi Charity that once promoted the idea that Libya was concerned about human rights for its citizens and others.</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099329.pdf\"> </a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099329.pdf\"> One of the ways that Libya ingratiated itself with the humanitarian operations of the U.N. was through the charity. In 2008, the Gaddafi Foundation entered to a </a><a href=\"http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/ngo657.doc.htm\"> with the U.N. department of public information in order to, &ldquo;diversify the geographical representation of the non-governmental organizations.&rdquo; </a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/ngo657.doc.htm\"> </a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/ngo657.doc.htm\"> The U.N. delayed a report that was</a><a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFLDE72224620110303?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true\">praising Libya&rsquo;s Human Rights</a> record. The U.N. Security Council has since affirmed a <a href=\"http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10200.doc.htm\">resolution</a> &nbsp;&ldquo;condemning the gross and systematic violation of human rights&rdquo; in Libya, <a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2014375436_apeuunescolibya.html\">cutting of ties</a> with the Gaddafi Charity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Gaddafi Foundation has been an overt lever of Libyan foreign policy. &nbsp;It posted an interview by a Russian journalist about Russian- Libyan relations. Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi stated on the charity website, which is currently not online, &ldquo;We have good relations with the West and Russia. However Libya chose Russia for a strategic partner; of course, Russia is a strategic partner, we cannot compare it to any other state in terms of proximity.&rdquo; Statements like these, show the way the charity, legitimized buy the U.N., enhanced the prestige if Libya and acted as an instrument of a corrupt state.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe foundation&rsquo;s website spoke of reforms to come in the new Libya. It published a 2005 interview with &nbsp;Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi&nbsp;stating, &ldquo;[W]e will open the old files of past violations, the files of the Revolutionary courts and the People&#39;s Court, and the people will be compensated. All these files will be opened; this means facts on the ground, and not merely talks on the media.&rdquo; Since rebels took over the city of Benghazi, the regime abandoned its reformist language, adopting a sinister tone. The foundation&rsquo;s president said, on state TV, as reported by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/21/gaddafi-son-muammar-libya\">Guardian</a>, &quot;Our army will be in Libya, and Muammar Gaddafi will be in it until the last moment ... We will eradicate them all.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGaddafi&rsquo;s daughter, a defense lawyer for Saddam Hussein, held a <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/aisha-gaddafi--goodwill-hunting-2228987.html\">U.N. Goodwill Ambassador</a> title but they have revoked her status since the Libyan crackdown.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn interesting cast of characters ran the foundation. The Council of Trustees for the organization included Chung-Hwan Keak, a founder of the Church that in 2004 held a<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/06/21/moon\"> coronation ceremony</a> in the capitol for its Reverend Sun Myung Moon, owner of the Washington Times newspaper.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnother former board member, Nobel Prize winner Sir Richard Roberts, found himself surrounded by controversy. &nbsp;He resigned from the prestigious London School of Economics in March after people found out that he accepted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/mar/06/gaddafi-charity-lse-donation-not-approved\">1.5 million pounds</a> from the Gaddafi Charity without transparency or approval.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe board also featured the former Prime Minister of Italy, Giulio Andreotti. His tenure was riddled with scandals and he was nicknamed &ldquo;The Black Pope.&rdquo; In 2003, he was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/31/world/court-clears-andreotti-of-murder-charge.html?ref=giulioandreotti\"> acquitted of murder </a>charges in the 1979 death of a journalist that was investigating him.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGeorge Papandreou, the embattled Prime Minister of Greece also served on the board of the Gaddafi Charity. Director Dr. Youssef Sawani, who has appeared in various FARA filings <a href=\"http://www.benjaminbarber.com/Benjamin%20Barber%20Qaddafi%20Foundation%20Press%20Release%202-22-11.pdf\">resigned</a> his post along with Benjamin Barber. Professor Hernando DeSoto <a href=\"http://www.ild.org.pe/images/stories/01_news/desotosletterofresignationgicdf.pdf\">resigned</a> in February.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Livingston Group, which <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/libya-and-algeria-rocked-protest-have-history-us-lobbying/\">lobbied for Gaddafi&rsquo;s regime</a> and his foundation in the United States, features a <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/search_result.php?searchby=P&amp;searchtext=livingston+group\">host of former government officials</a>, including former members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. On behalf of their clients, Livingston Group lobbyists met with members of Congress and their staff, the State Department and heads of Washington think tanks.

In some cases, these payments were made in honor of many members of Congress&mdash;not only those on the Super Committee.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe industries doing the giving include pharmaceutical, energy and defense&mdash;all of which have a big stake in the upcoming negotiations to slash at least $1.2 trillion from the country&rsquo;s deficit.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn Aug. 6, days after a deal was struck to raise the nation&rsquo;s debt ceiling and create the super committee, many company executives and lobbyists hit the links with one of the newly-named members: Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C. Dozens of corporations, including many whose PACs back Clyburn&#39;s congressional campaigns, spent thousands of dollars to sponsor his 21st annual charity golf tournament&mdash;called the<a href=\"http://canzaterclassic.com/\"> Rudolph Canzater Classic</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong the <a href=\"http://canzaterclassic.com/2011-sponsors\">highest-level sponsors</a>&mdash;who all chipped in $20,000&mdash;was defense contractor Fluor Corp. a perennial Clyburn contributor to which Clyburn helped <a href=\"http://www.clyburnforcongress.com/news/in-the-news/23-clyburn-reaps-ample-earmark-bounty.html\">steer $1.6 billion</a> in stimulus funds. The other top sponsors were the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, the industry&rsquo;s main trade group, drug maker AstraZeneca, and the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America.&nbsp; All of these companies&mdash;except AstraZeneca&mdash;were listed as sponsors to <a href=\"http://canzaterclassic.com/2010-sponsors\">last year&rsquo;s tournament</a> too. Defense, Medicare and Medicaid, and the home mortgage interest tax deduction could all potentially face cuts from the super committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo varying degrees, the donations&mdash;to lawmakers&#39; charities, to nonprofits holding galas honoring lawmakers, paying for meetings or conferences held by lawmakers&mdash;are another way, other than lobbying and PAC donations, that corporations can attempt to sway lawmakers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClyburn spokeswoman Hope Derrick wrote in an email that the &ldquo;[c]ongressman views his interactions with sponsors and attendees at the Canzater Classic as being no more or less than their visits to his office, interactions with him at Washington events or his visits to their offices and tours of their facilities.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe added that, &ldquo;Many of the corporations you mentioned have been coming to the event for years. This year&rsquo;s event was held before he was named to the Super Committee.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCyburn&#39;s event drew just short of 600 golfers, according to Derrick, and the event raised about $400,000 for college scholarships for needy students.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn disclosures released so far this year, lobbyists and companies reported paying about $130,000 for the tournament, a number that will likely increase when more donations are reported early next year. That number does not include some of the biggest sponsors, Dell and Microsoft, who contributed <a href=\"http://thetandd.com/news/local/article_41d251dc-a3fc-11df-896b-001cc4c002e0.html\">over $200,000</a> in computers and software to students last year, nor many others that have been listed in the past two years. These corporate donations helped make him the third most honored lawmaker in 2009 and 2010, according to a <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/lobbyists-pay-millions-honor-congress-executive-branch/\">Sunlight Foundation analysis</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Other Super Committee members</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t*During the committee&rsquo;s negotiations, <strong>Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich.</strong>, the chair of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, may be pushed to advocate for corporate tax reform, something championed by the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/61398.html\">Chamber of Commerce</a> and lobbied on by <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/client_reports.php?id=D000000720&amp;year=2011\">IBM</a>. The Chamber spent over $1,000 honoring Camp and a host of other lawmakers for an event in March, although the report does not say what the event was for. IBM contributed $10,000 to the pro-trade Emergency Committee for American Trade (ECAT) in <a href=\"http:// http://www.ecattrade.com/content.asp?ID=877\">March for an event</a> presenting Camp and Jim Matheson, D-Utah, with awards.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t*<strong>Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.</strong>, also received plenty of accolades during the first half of the year. When he was <a href=\"http://www.bryceharlow.org/awards/highlights.cfm\">honored by</a> the Bryce Harlow Foundation, a nonprofit promoting ethics in lobbying, in April, Chevron, Marathon Oil, Shell, the American Petroleum Institute, were among the companies and organizations being generous.

The American College of Physicians paid for a $139 plaque in April for the senator. AARP bought Baucus and other <a href=\"http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-02-2011/2010_congressional_award_recipients.html\">2010 congressional award recipients</a> plaques&mdash;at a cost of about $1,500.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn one case, the American Medical Group Association reported over $500 in meetings costs related to an event with Baucus.

Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas</strong>, and <strong>Patty Murray, D-Wash.</strong> have each received just one honorary contribution so far this year. Energy Future Holdings disclosed a $370 payment in honor of Hensarling; it&rsquo;s unclear what the nature of the event was. Defense contractor SAIC donated $2,500 to <a href=\"http://www.petsforpatriots.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=TezyWDNUmn4%3D&amp;tabid=116\">Pets for Patriots</a> in honor of Murray and a host of other lawmakers, the company reported.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, lobbying companies did honor Murray with about $120,000 in donations in <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/lobbyists-pay-millions-honor-congress-executive-branch/\">2009 and 2010,</a> according to a Sunlight Foundation analysis that divided the donation amount if it went towards honoring multiple people.

Sharply rising health care costs and their centrality to the political discourse make health care a certain target, in spite of the intense <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/61398.html\">lobbying</a> <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/11/us-lobby-groups-idUSTRE77A6JG20110811\">onslaught</a> that&#39;s already begun.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt&#39;s not just wonks who believe it: health care stocks <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/01/us-healthcare-stocks-idUSTRE77042H20110801\">plunged</a>, in many cases <a href=\"http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20110808/NEWS/308089886\">much further</a> than the rest of the market, over the last couple of weeks, in part due to the looming debt battle. No one knows yet which, if any, health care programs will be targeted, although some have been repeatedly <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/60868.html\">bandied about</a>, including bits and pieces of the <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h3590/text\">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a>, the health care overhaul passed in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut what happens if the bipartisan committee can&#39;t come to an agreement -- or Congress won&#39;t pass their recommendations? At least one long-time Washington insider thinks it&#39;s unlikely that they will. Stan Collender, a former congressional budget staffer, <a href=\"http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2011/August/03/debt-deal-FAQ.aspx?utm_source=khn&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=viewed\">told Kaiser Health News </a>that he gives less than a five percent chance that Congress will pass any of the committee&#39;s recommendations. &quot;In an era of hyper-partisanship have you seen any other special committee of elected officials come up with some broad-based deficit reduction package looking at tax increases and spending cuts?&quot; he asked.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne thing is certain: if Congress doesn&#39;t pass the committee&#39;s recommendations by December 23, Medicare providers will see their payments cut by an automatic two percent. Some doctors&#39; groups and seniors&#39; advocates worry this will lead more doctors to restrict their Medicare practices -- or to stop seeing Medicare patients altogether.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt isn&#39;t an idle worry. A <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/25/AR2010112503638.html\">spate</a> of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/02/business/retirementspecial/02health.html\">news</a> <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2010-06-20-medicare_N.htm\">articles</a> in the last couple of years warned of a Medicare doctor shortage, especially among primary care physicians. Surveys conducted by doctors&#39; groups seemed to bolster the concerns: the American Medical Association, among the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/reports/supercommittees.php\">top 100 donors</a> to the Super committee members, found that more than 30 percent of primary care doctors in their survey limited the number of Medicare patients in their practice.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt makes sense that Medicare might be losing doctors, since the program pays health care providers an average of about 80 percent of what private insurers shell out, and has for years. But has that already started happening?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA couple of recent studies tried to answer this question, with surprising results. A recent <a href=\"http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/found-doctors-who-take-medicare/\">study</a> based on CDC surveys found that a small percentage of doctors were leaving Medicare, but not as many as were dropping private insurance patients. (Almost 93 percent of doctors still accepted new Medicare patients, the survey found, down from 95.5; private fee-for-service acceptance slipped from 97 percent to under 90 percent over the same period, 2005 - 2008.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA recent <a href=\"http://medpac.gov/chapters/Mar11_Ch04.pdf\">report</a> by MedPAC, the independent panel that advises Congress on Medicare costs, came to similar conclusions. Not only did patients with private insurance (aged 50 - 64) report more difficulty getting an appointment with a new primary care doctor in 2010 than did Medicare patients, they also were more likely to report having to wait too long for an appointment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Essentially, the percent of physicians taking Medicare is still extremely high,&quot; said Miriam Laguesen, a professor of health policy and management at Columbia University. &quot;We&#39;re not at a crisis point right now.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are a few reasons why doctors might choose to accept Medicare even though it pays less than the private companies. Researchers with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in 2009 <a href=\"http://www.rwjf.org/files/research/48408physician.pdf\">found</a> that slightly more doctors thought Medicare gave them more autonomy to make decisions and made it easier for them to get the services their patients needed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut there might be a simpler reason. &quot;If you&#39;re not going to take Medicare patients in the next two decades and you&#39;re not a pediatrician, who are you going to take?&quot; said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and author of the book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Political-Medicare-American-Politics-Economy/dp/0226615960/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1313696403&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=wwwsunlightfo-20\">The Political Life of Medicare</a>. &quot;Most physicians cannot turn down Medicare patients simply because they&#39;re too reliant on [them].&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf doctor participation in Medicare generally remains high, the numbers among family doctors are more troubling. The MedPAC study found that only 83 percent of primary care physicians accepted new Medicare patients in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPartly, this is because these doctors make much less than specialists and have narrower profit margins to protect, even after a recent set of Medicare fixes that boosted their earnings. Specialists are also able to <a href=\"http://healthcarecostmonitor.thehastingscenter.org/wesleyboyd/narrowing-the-pay-gap-between-primary-care-physicians-and-specialists/\">perform more procedures</a>, and under the current system, doctors receive more money the more individual procedures they perform.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s hard to imagine [a two percent pay cut] would have much of an effect on physicians accepting Medicare patients,&quot; said Bradley Herring, director of the health economics and policy program at Johns Hopkins.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDr. Roland Goertz, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said that while he thinks a two percent pay cut would cause a small number of doctors to reach their tipping point and to halt or restrict their Medicare practices, there&#39;s a much bigger bogeyman on the horizon.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince 1997, Congress has been required to keep Medicare payments to doctors at or below the economy&#39;s growth rate. Since 2002, payments have outstripped that rate, known as the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR), but rather than take the politically toxic step of cutting off money to doctors, Congress puts it off -- every year -- with something called the &quot;doc fix.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy now, those required cuts have grown to almost 30 percent of doctors&#39; current payments. They&#39;re worth nearly $300 billion.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDr. Goertz said there&#39;s &quot;no question&quot; we&#39;ll see massive changes if this sword of Damocles falls: many family practice doctors will limit the number of Medicare patients they see or leave the program altogether, leaving seniors scrambling to find doctors. But most experts say it&#39;s unlikely that will happen any time soon.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;The bottom line is the SGR is a useful political fiction,&quot; said Oberlander, the University of North Carolina professor. &quot;Ending the fiction is costly.&quot; Oberlander said he would be &quot;stunned&quot; if the super committee ended the annual doc fix. &quot;[My] best guess is they find another patch and maintain the fiction.&quot;</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-08-19 10:08:31", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "medicare-and-super-committee-can-docs-afford-lose-two-percent-th", "tags": "Super Committee, health care, lobbying, Medicare, Medicaid, campaign contributions, Sen.

From January to June of 2011, the<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/lobbying/fara/803\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.fara.gov/docs/5356-Supplemental-Statement-20110728-14.pdf\">Livingston Group</a><a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/lobbying/fara/803\"> </a>penned 80 emails, placed 30 phone calls, engaged in 27 meetings in the U.S. and a few in Cairo and sent a text message on behalf of the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Egyptian embassy hires the PLM Group who then subcontract with the Livingston Group, Moffett&nbsp; Group and Podesta Group. PLM Group reported that Egypt paid them <a href=\"http://www.fara.gov/docs/5825-Supplemental-Statement-20110728-8.pdf\">$555,000</a> so far this year while in 2010 Egyptian Embassy spent $1.3 million for PLM lobbying the U.S. government. While the Egypt Information Office <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/egypts-pr-shop-terminates-their-us-operation/\">terminated their lobbying contract</a> in February 2011 there are six other Egyptian entities that did not report terminating their lobbying contracts, forms submitted with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act show.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the beginning of January, the Livingston Group emailed the State Department, military officials, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Central Command regarding the political unrest that the Mubarak regime was facing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMilitary officials were contacted frequently during the protests to discuss security issues and then, after Mubarak resigned to discuss the transition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Livingston Group lobbyist, David Dumke contacted <a href=\"http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=10793\">Maj. Gen. F.C. Williams</a>, the Director of the U.S. office of military cooperation, six times before arranging a meeting with Williams in Cairo on Jan. 17, 2011.&nbsp; Williams serves as the principle military official at the American Embassy in Cairo. After the transition, Williams was again contacted regarding the political transition.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEarly in the lobbying campaign, the heavyweight-lobbying firm headed by former Louisiana representative, Bob Livingston, R-La., started supplementing their military and state department contacts with congressional contacts. Livingston called the staff of Speaker John Boehner R-Ohio, Rep. Eric Cantor R-Va., and Rep. Rodger Wicker R-Miss. about the political unrest in late January.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn Feb. 11, the day Mubarak resigned, Livingston Group contacted U.S. Africa Command.&nbsp; Three days later, Livingston Group reached out to three of Rep. Cantor&rsquo;s staff regarding the status of political transition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Livingston Group refused to provide any comment for this story.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLobbying records show a stark similarity in the people contacted during and after the political revolution where the Livingston group continued to fulfill its obligations to the State of Egypt, regardless of the internal turmoil.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe only thing that changed on the <a href=\"http://www.fara.gov/docs/5825-Supplemental-Statement-20110728-8.pd\">forms</a> during the six month period was that the crisis situation was later described as a transitional one. For example, on Feb. 9 and Feb. 11, the day Mubarak decided to step down, the description of his contact with U.S. Africa Command stated it was about, &ldquo;the current status of U.S./Egyptian relations and the political crisis in Egypt.&rdquo; And on Feb. 10 and 12, the U.S. Office of Military Cooperation was contacted about, &ldquo;the current status of U.S./Egyptian relations and the political transition in Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA week later, the focus quickly shifted to appropriations and getting money for Egypt, only this time it was the transitional military regime taking over the reins. Lobbying focused on limits and conditions for military aid to Egypt&nbsp;On Feb. 16 Robert Livingston contacted senior advisors for six congressmen to strike funding for the U.S. Military Financing Program.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn April, Livingston lobbyists pushed for the defense appropriations bill, which had a line in it which called for securing &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h1473/text?version=enr&amp;nid=t0:enr:1666\">up to $250,000,000</a>&rdquo; for electoral, civil society and poverty assistance to Egypt.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">\r\n\tOnce that was accomplished, the lobbying group turned focus on debt relief for the country between March 29 through April 21. It kicked off its lobbying with the majority and minority directors of the House Committee of Foreign Affairs. Bob Livingston then called Rep Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y. and Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBillions of dollars in debt relief was not an easy sell, a staffer at the time described the endeavor as, &ldquo;<a href=\"http://origin-www.congress.org/news/2011/04/12/congress_split_on_egypt_relief\">a tough row to hoe</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Livingston Group helped solidify support for Egyptian debt relief by repeatedly contacting congressional offices. Livingston Group even coordinated meetings with key congressional leaders and Abdol Naga, the Egyptian Minister of International Corporation. A month after a series of meetings about debt relief, President Obama announced the U.S. plan to forgive a <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/05/19/remarks-president-middle-east-and-north-africa\">billion dollars</a> of Egyptian debt on May 19.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn June, Livingston Group continued congressional, business and military correspondence.&nbsp; A surprising military contact in Livingston&rsquo;s log was Christian Westermann part of the Biological Chemical Weapons Section of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, Department of State. Livingston contacted Westermann on June 6. The only description of this email was that it was to &ldquo;discuss the current status of U.S./Egyptian&nbsp; relations and the political transition in Egypt.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOver the years, <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/registrant/Livingston%20Group/\">Livingston Group&rsquo;s</a> foreign clients have included Libya, The Republic of Congo and <a href=\"http://www.fara.gov/docs/5356-Supplemental-Statement-20040731-I5J4JW05.pdf\">Morocco</a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPodesta Group, another lobbying firm hired by Egypt continued to lobby in a similar manner to Livingston Group. They met with the office of House Foreign Affairs Committee in January, to discuss &ldquo;U.S.-Egypt relations.&rdquo; In the two months before the fall of Mubarak, <a href=\"http://www.fara.gov/docs/5926-Supplemental-Statement-20110730-5.pdf\">Podesta Group</a> emailed or called the offices of Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., Sen. Robert Casey, D-Pa., Joe Lieberman, Ind-Conn., Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere is a brief break in lobbying by the Podesta group between the Feb. 11 resignation and the Feb. 16 contacts made by the <a href=\"http://www.fara.gov/docs/5926-Supplemental-Statement-20110730-5.pdf\">Podesta Group</a> to the U.S. embassy in Cairo, the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Moffett Group has not yet released their lobbying filings for the first half of this year.

Over the next several days, we&rsquo;ll be taking a look at each of the major groups of contributors to the economic crisis, who the major players were, what political influence they brought to bear on Congress and regulators, how Dodd-Frank intends to regulate them, and, using our new Dodd-Frank Meeting Logs tool, what rules these groups are trying to influence as agencies implement the legislation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Group: </strong>Credit Rating Agencies<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Members: </strong>Standard and Poor, Moody&rsquo;s Investor Service, Fitch&rsquo;s Ratings<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Regulators:</strong> Securities and Exchange Commission</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Political Influence: </strong>Compared to investment banks, commercial banks, government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and the mortgage mills like Countrywide Financial, the three credit ratings agencies seem like minor players. Altogether, lobbyists for the three agencies have reported spending a total of $9 million to influence federal policy since 2001, and collectively, campaign contributions from their employees and family members amount to less than $300,000 over the past two decades. By contrast, in the first six months of the 2012 election cycle, Goldman Sachs&rsquo; PAC, employees and their family members have contributed more then $512,000, and over the same six months, securities and investment firms have reported spending $49.5 million on lobbyists, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut when Standard &amp; Poor downgraded U.S. debt from the highest rating, AAA, to the second highest, AA+, they demonstrated a kind of influence that corporate CEOs, the hapless investors who plowed their money into mortgage-backed securities, leaders and citizens of Eurozone countries including Greece and Italy have already learned quite well. By offering their opinions of the soundness of debt, credit ratings agencies can make fortunes for some and break them for others.<br />\r\n\t<strong>How They Helped Cause the Crisis:</strong> Starting around 2004, credit rating agencies offered the highest ratings to financial instruments that were far riskier than advertised; investors bought the triple-A-rated bonds believing they were putting their funds in low risk investments. Specifically, the rating agencies issued investment grade ratings for tens of thousands of residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) peddled by Wall Street firms. In return, the rating agencies saw an increased revenue stream from these firms.<br />\r\n\tLater in 2007, when the first mortgage delinquencies started to get reported, the rating agencies began downgrading the RMBS and CDOs. Some institutional investors who are barred from owning low rated securities had to dump the holdings, an investigation by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found earlier this year. The independent committee poured over tens of thousands of pages of internal documents and conduced several dozen interviews as part of the <a href=\"http://hsgac.senate.gov/public/_files/Financial_Crisis/FinancialCrisisReport.pdf \">investigation.</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne focus of investigators was the inherent conflict of interest that ratings agencies presented. While rating agencies were required to provide accurate ratings, they were dependent on the firms selling the assets they were rating for payment. Giving their products low ratings was potentially bad for business. After the financial crisis played out in 2007 and 2008, evidence that emerged showing that credit rating agencies continued to ignore several signs&mdash;including the high-risk nature of many of the loans packaged to investors, including evidence of fraudulent mortgages&mdash;and continued to assign them investment quality ratings.<br />\r\n\t<strong>How They Fared: </strong>Despite giving inflated ratings to assets that turned out to be toxic, the credit ratings agencies continue to rate corporate and public debt, and have preserved their position of influence in the economy.<br />\r\n\t<strong> How Dodd-Frank Regulates Them:</strong> The new law created the Office of Credit Ratings at the SEC to examine the agencies&mdash;which are designated Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSRO)&mdash;and release a report at least once a year. It also called for the NRSROs to disclose their methodologies&mdash;disclosures that are due next month&mdash;and reduces the dependence on ratings goading investors to take on more independent reviews.<br />\r\n\tTo eliminate conflicts of interest, under Dodd-Frank compliance officers were barred from working on ratings, methodologies or sales and added a liability clause for &ldquo;reckless failure to conduct a reasonable investigation.&rdquo; It also gives the SEC the authority to deregister a rating agency.<br />\r\n\tBut despite these changes, one of the main conflict of interest features continues to plague the credit ratings agencies, where there has been no change to the business model where the raters are still paid by the investors whose products they rate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>How They&rsquo;re Reacting to Dodd-Frank: </strong>According to our Dodd-Frank meeting log tracker, officials from Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/doddfrank/agency/sec/4e160c314f90d41c6f0002e9\">met with SEC </a>officials on Oct. 20, 2010, and April 17, 2011, to <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/doddfrank/agency/sec/4e160c314f90d41c6f0002e3\">discuss various issues</a> relating to oversight of credit ratings agencies. Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s sent a 84-page <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-18-11/s71811-32.pdf\">response</a> to the SEC&rsquo;s proposed rules governing NRSROs, arguing that, while neither Dodd-Frank nor the 2006 Credit Agency Reform Act intended to tamper with the independence of the agencies, the SEC&rsquo;s rules could. In one passage, Deven Sharma, president of S&amp;P, argued that the SEC&rsquo;s attempt to define what is a significant error would substitute the judgment of regulators for those of S&amp;P. &ldquo;Credit ratings reflect the subjective opinions of committees of rating analysts and incorporate both quantitative and qualitative factors, we believe it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Commission to establish a principled definition of what might constitute a &lsquo;significant error.&rsquo;&rdquo; The Treasury Department <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Just-the-Facts-SPs-2-Trillion-Mistake.aspx\">claimed</a> that S&amp;P made a $2 trillion <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/sp-explains-why-2-trillion-error-irrelevant\">error </a>when evaluating U.S. budgets and debt; S&amp;P disputed<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFitch Ratings had <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/doddfrank/agency/sec/4e160c314f90d41c6f0002ec\">one meeting</a> with the SEC, on Oct. 12, 2010, and filed three pages of comments in response to the SEC&rsquo;s proposed rules for oversseing NRSROs.

It will be the first debate since the latest campaign finance reports have been filed, showing Mitt Romney with a substantial financial lead over his competitors.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough FOX News, the cable channel sponsoring and airing the debate, has not officially announced which candidates will take the stage on Thursday, we expect to see:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tMichele Bachmann, U.S. representative from Minnesota</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tHerman Cain, former executive of Godfather&#39;s Pizza and former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tRick Santorum, former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tNewt Gingrich, former speaker of the House and representative from Georgia</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThaddeus McCotter, U.S. representative from Michigan</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tJon Huntsman, Jr., former governor of Utah</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tRon Paul, U.S. representative from Texas</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tTim Pawlenty, former governor of Minnesota</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tMitt Romney, former governor of Massachusetts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen it comes to campaign contributions, Romney has raised more than $18.2 million as of July 15 and spent about $5.5 million, according to the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/summary.php\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRestore Our Future, a Super PAC started by Romney backers has raised another $12.3 million so far, according to <a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/cancomsrs/?_12+C00490045\">Federal Election Commission reports. </a>The Super PAC made news recently when an anonymous Romney supporter founded a company named W Spann LLC, made a $1 million donation to the Super PAC through that company, and then dissolved the company. Politico and other sources <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/60776.html\">reported that donor was Edward Conard</a>, a former executive at Bain Capital, an asset management firm co-founded by Romney. Super PACs, or independent-expenditure-only committees, can accept contributions of unlimited amounts from individuals, corporations and labor unions as long as the Super PAC does not make contributions to candidates or coordinate with the official campaign.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen there are the Republican candidates who have spent more than they&#39;ve raised on their campaigns. As of July 15, <a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/pres/2011/Q2/C00494393.html\">Pawlenty&#39;s campaign</a> was more than $1,000 in debt, <a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/pres/2011/Q2/C00497511.html\">Bachmann&#39;s campaign</a> had a deficit of more than $364,000, and <a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/pres/2011/Q2/C00496497.html\">Gingrich&#39;s campaign</a> was more than $1 million in the red.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTraditionally, candidates who do well during the Iowa debate and the subsequent straw poll and caucus on Aug.13, usually have a better shot at gaining their party&#39;s presidential nomination. But the 2008 elections <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/whither-iowa/2011/05/18/AFcvpZ6G_blog.html\">raised questions about this notion</a>. In 2008, Romney won the Ames straw poll, Mike Huckabee won the caucus, but it was John McCain who won the Republican nomination.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTopics of interest to Iowa voters include corn subsidies, ethanol, and issues of concern to Christian conservatives, like gay marriage and abortion, so expect to see candidates touch on those subjects during Thursday&#39;s debate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStates that hold earlier primary elections or caucuses sometimes receive more federal money following a competitive election, according to a <a href=\"http://prq.sagepub.com/content/63/2/398.abstract\">recent study out of North Carolina State University</a>. After wondering whether &ldquo;presidential candidates pledge more federal spending per capita to these states because doing well in their contests is critical to capturing the nomination,&rdquo; researchers found that to indeed be the case.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThursday&#39;s debate is being hosted by FOX News and the Washington Examiner.

He <a href=\"http://www.clotureclub.com/2011/07/member-week-rob-portman-senator-ohio/\">has received </a>$4 million in contributions from the financial services and real estate sector and another $1.8 million has come from lobbyists and lawyers.

First, at the U.S. Trade Representative from 2005 to 2006 and then as director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) from 2006 to 2007. In 2008 Portman took a hiatus from public service at which time he formed two PACS and had his name tossed around as a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/22/us/politics/22veep.html?ref=robportman\">possible running mate </a>for John McCain. <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=70007\">Before entering politics</a>, Portman worked at several prominent D.C. law firms including Patton Boggs, Graydon, Head &amp; Ritchey and Sanders, Squire &amp; Dempsey. Portman&#39;s campaign committee as well as his two PACs, America&#39;s majority Trust and Ohio&#39;s Future PAC, have raised over $22 million. His former employers, Graydon, Head &amp; Ritchey and Sanders, Squire &amp; Dempsey were two of Portman&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00003682&amp;type=I\">top 20 contributors</a>.

During his time in Congress, the two firms donated nearly $200,000 to the Ohio Republican.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">\r\n\tPortman voted in favor of the legislation that created the &ldquo;super congress&rdquo; of which he could potentially be a member, given his former experience on budget committees and OMB Director. In his official statement he touted the bill to raise the debt ceiling as a, &ldquo;Step in the right direction because it begins to address Washington&#39;s addiction to higher spending and dangerous levels of debt.&rdquo; In terms of budget cuts, Portman suggested in a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article that the <a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/government-in-columbus/ohio-sen-rob-portman-make-the-dollar-for-dollar-rule-permanent\">&ldquo;dollar-for-dollar&rdquo;</a> rule be made permanent, matching debt ceiling increase with spending cuts.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-08-05 17:04:06", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "dc-insider-sen-portman-another-possible-pick-super-congress", "tags": "super congress, Supercongress, debt ceiling, budget, super committee", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2428, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-08-05 11:08:49", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 20, "timestamp": "2011-08-05 09:26:56", "image": "", "title": "Hybrid committee is both Super PAC, traditional PAC", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tA new type of Super PAC has <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/outside-spending/letters/C00500033\">filed registration papers</a> with the Federal Election Commission, saying it plans both to accept unlimited contributions for independent expenditures and, using a separate bank account, to take in limited donations to be used for direct contributions to candidates.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUntil now, Super PACs and traditional PACs have been separate.

The FEC voted on two draft Advisory Opinions, but neither got enough votes for approval.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNational Defense PAC then <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/docs/?id=205040-complaint-carey-v-fec\">filed its lawsuit</a>. In June, a U.S. District Court <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/docs/?id=229985-carey-v-fec-court-order\">granted a preliminary injunction</a> allowing National Defense PAC to proceed with its plan.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe founder of Efficient America PAC, Lee O&#39;Neal, said the organization was formed to support energy-efficiency legislation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tO&#39;Neal said the group does not plan to explicity support or oppose candidates with its independent expenditures. &quot;Independent expenditures will be to make people aware of bills that are showing up,&quot; he said. &quot;We will be making donations to candidates that are supporting or sponsoring the legislation.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMost contributions will be made online, he said, with separate forms for each bank account.

All they had to do was fill out a few forms and in return they could expect to receive checks of up to $50,000. The only problem was, the plan was a sham.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd earlier this year, Riverside county authorities finally caught up with the ploy and arrested <a href=\"http://www.nctimes.com/business/article_5767acc3-7081-58c2-9138-dd4650733f13.html\">Jose Ochoa</a> and others accusing them with grand theft for the purported <a href=\"http://www.nctimes.com/business/article_5767acc3-7081-58c2-9138-dd4650733f13.html\">mortgage fraud</a>. He was accused of misusing information from people with good credit to take out as many as 50 mortgages. And for Ochoa, it was mighty profitable. He made at least $5.4 million renting or selling them, according to the North County Times.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe &quot;investors&quot; didn&#39;t know Ochoa&#39;s mortgages had been taken out in their names; some even found that Ochoa had signed them up for five mortgages in a single day.&nbsp;And Ochoa did not keep up with the mortgage payments. Eventually, the properties fell in to foreclosure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRiverside, the southern California county <a href=\"http://www.fincen.gov/mlf_sar_data/\">ranked</a> fifth for suspicious mortgage activity in 2011, according to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which is part of the Treasury Department. FinCEN recently released five years of <a href=\"http://www.fincen.gov/mlf_sar_data/index.html\">data</a> on reports of mortgage fraud suspicious activity, including the abuses in Riverside. FinCEN collects data on the number of reported mortgage fraud cases in each county across the country and publicly releases aggregate data.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd now Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) are on the rise again. In the first quarter of 2011, suspicions of mortgage fraud are up 31 percent from the same quarter last year, according to <a href=\"http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/nr/html/20110628.html\">FinCEN</a>. The total SARs reflect the number of people or organizations suspected of making suspicious loans not the number of suspicious loans.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/mortgage-fraud\">As this map</a> shows, mortgage fraud is far more common than one conman or one county. It&#39;s a problem that&#39;s been sweeping through the country.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/mortgage-fraud\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/reporting/uploads/mortgage.jpg\" style=\"width: 590px; height: 379px;\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe data have been released because the Treasury Department and local authorities find SAR reports to be useful investigative tools. For example, officials pulled together this <a href=\"http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/sar_case_example_list.html?catid=00002\">list</a> of Bank Security Act Data exposing criminals and winning convictions using this data. In 2006, <a href=\"http://www.fincen.gov/law_enforcement/ss/html/044.html\">100 SARs</a> uncovered a huge mortgage elimination fraud.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEach SAR report is listed in the quarter that the suspicious activity began. As new reports of mortgage fraud emerge, totals for the year of the scam increase.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSuspected mortgage fraud hotspots correlate with places hardest hit by the housing bubble. Large numbers of foreclosures create opportunities for fraud, which in turn can lead to increased foreclosures. Nevada, Florida and California states with the highest foreclosure rates also have the highest rates of suspicious mortgage fraud.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n\tSeveral counties stood out in our analysis:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b>: Had the most SARs in 2010 with more than 2,000 reports.

Nobody knows yet who will take on this task, but it&rsquo;s a sure bet that whoever it is will already be in debt themselves -- to the lobbyists and industries who fund their campaigns and who have a huge stake in the outcome of the deal. That debt will only grow bigger as monied interests use all the tricks of their trade to influence the deal.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere is a list of a dozen lawmakers with highlights of their close ties to industries and lobbyists. We make no claim that these will be the anointed ones. We&rsquo;ll be watching along with everyone else and will update profiles as we learn the identities of who will serve on this powerful committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., </strong>is Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, a key committee regulating tax, trade, Social Security and Medicare issues. Over the course of his his career in the House, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00008086&amp;type=I\">his major donors</a> have been healthcare interests, the insurance industry, and pharmaceutical companies. His top contributors include Dow Chemical and Blue Cross Blue Shield.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a <a href=\"http://waysandmeans.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=241690\">press statement</a> in May, Camp toed his party&rsquo;s line in calling for the administration to &ldquo;demonstrate the leadership America expects from Washington and work with the Congress to enact significant reductions in government spending &mdash; including entitlement programs like Medicare.&rdquo; He has also repeatedly gone on the record opposing a large tax increase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the past, lobbyists for companies such as AT&amp;T and groups such as the Assisted Living Federation PAC have <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/pol/N00008086/\">hosted fundraising events</a> for Camp. Former Senator <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lobbyist.php?id=Y00000386730&amp;year=2011\">Trent Lott</a>,&nbsp;who&rsquo;s now&nbsp; a lobbyist for the likes of AT&amp;T, General Electric and Goldman Sachs, was also scheduled to hold a <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/party/27204/\">fundraiser </a>for Camp on Aug. 4, which has now been canceled, according to the group managing the event.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.,</strong> is at the helm of the House Budget Committee and has been the chief architect of the Republicans&rsquo; budget plan, which called for a massive overhaul of entitlement programs. Ryan&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2011/04/paul-ryans-health-industry-ties.html\">contributors</a> include the insurance sector, securities and investment, and healthcare professionals, all of whom are affected by his budget proposals. Ryan has received more than $269,000 from the health sector, placing him tenth among Republicans and fifth among health services industry with contributions of more than $43,000, according to <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2011/04/paul-ryans-health-industry-ties.html\">opensecrets.org.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis largest <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00004357&amp;type=I\">contributors</a> include insurance giant Northwestern Mutual, AT&amp;T, Koch Industries and Wall Street interests. In the last election cycle,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?type=C&amp;cid=N00004357&amp;newMem=N&amp;cycle=2010\">Ryan&rsquo;s campaign</a>&nbsp;saw a sharp increase in donations, with his leadership PAC and re-election committee receiving more than $5 million, compared with only $2 million in 2008 -- this despite the fact he wasn&rsquo;t in a tight race. So far, Ryan has raised more than <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?type=C&amp;cid=N00004357&amp;newMem=N&amp;cycle=2012\">$2.5 million in the 2012 cycle</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., -</strong> As Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Rogers has been a favorite among defense contractors and lobbyists giving contributions. On<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00003473&amp;type=I\"> top of the list</a> of sectors backing him is energy, with $783,000, followed by lawyers, law firms and lobbyists which, taken together, have contributed about $482,000 to his campaign and political action committee. Among the defense contractors on his top 20 donor list are Lockheed Martin and United Technologies, both of which have received earmarks from his committee in the last three years, according to data from <a href=\"http://transparencydata.com/#\">Transparencydata.com.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith his deep ties to the the defense industry, Rogers could play an important role if he&rsquo;s part of the committee, with defense being a key issue of contention between the dueling sides. According to the debt ceiling bill that was passed, if it comes down to the wire, and the super committee&#39;s recommendations don&rsquo;t meet approval, there will be spending cuts to defense worth close to $600 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.,</strong>&nbsp;the&nbsp;House Minority Whip and the person responsible in delivering votes from the Democratic caucus, has deep healthcare industry and lobbyist ties. He has <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00001821&amp;type=I\">received</a> more than $3.6 million from the finance, insurance and real estate sectors over the years. He has also been a prolific fundraiser from law firms and lobbyists, collecting $2 million, and $2.6 million from the health sector.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHoyer has <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=14129\">18 former staffers</a> who have gone on to become industry lobbyists, including two of his chiefs of staff. Several who have gone on to lobby for healthcare interests, including<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=36696\"> Anderson Cory</a>, his former chief of staff who is now a lobbyist with United Healthcare Group. At several points during the debt negotiations, Hoyer has explicitly reiterated his caucus&rsquo; stand which demanded tax increases as part of the deal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash.,</strong> is ranking member on the House Appropriations Committee and the lead minority member on the defense subcommittee. He has received flak for being close to lobbyists. In 2009, Dicks was was in trouble for receiving several donations from disgraced lobbying firm PMA group while he directed several earmarks for their clients. The Office of Congressional Ethics dismissed all wrongdoing in their <a href=\"http://oce.house.gov/pdf/OCE-Referral-for-Dismissal-Regarding-Rep-Dicks.pdf\">report</a>&nbsp;later that year.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut his <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00007918&amp;type=I\">top industry contributors</a> have a clear <a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2008906547_pma23.html\">link</a> to the earmark recipients and to the lobbying groups that are their hired guns. On the top of this list are lobbyists and lawyers, who have donated more than $1.2 million to boost his career.&nbsp; An additional $1 million comes from the defense industry.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Rep. Collin Peterson, D- Minn., </strong>who is the ranking member of the House Agriculture committee, will certainly be watching the negotiations closely&nbsp;if not selected to be on the super committee. While the debt ceiling agreement was devoid of most agriculture related topics, a deep cut to ag-subsidies could be top on the agenda for the chosen 12.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPeterson has <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00004558&amp;type=I\">received</a> more than $3.2 million from the agriculture-business sector and about $1.2 million from the labor sector. He was also one of the 11 Democrats who crossed party lines to vote against the Reid bill. Peterson has <a href=\"http://www.agriculture.com/news/policy/fmer-ag-committee-chair-has-doubts_4-ar18036\">voiced his concern</a> about the structure of the committee in public. &ldquo;My guess is that there won&rsquo;t be anybody on there who will know much about this,&rdquo; Peterson said, talking about the super committee yet to be picked.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas</strong> - A supporter of the debt bill, Hutchison is retiring at the end of the 112th Congress. While she&rsquo;s been in the Senate, her<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00005675&amp;type=I\"> top contributing industry </a>has been oil and gas companies, followed by lawyers and law firms. Her <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00005675&amp;type=I\">top career donors </a>include Enron, Exxon Mobil, and Shell Oil. Craig Felner and Lisa M. Jaeger, two of her former staffers, are now <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientlbs.php?id=D000022303&amp;year=2011\">lobbyists</a> for Valero Energy, one of her top donors. Among the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientbills.php?id=D000022303&amp;year=2011\">bills the company is lobbying on</a> is the Energy Tax Prevention Act, which would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from promulgating regulations that would regulate greenhouse gases. The senator is a cosponsor. Hutchison also recently signed on to a <a href=\"http://campaignmoney.org/files/LetterOilSubsidies.pdf\">letter</a> to Obama arguing that oil and gas companies are an engine of economic growth, the implication being that talk of reducing energy subsidies should be ditched.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D. - </strong>Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and one of the &ldquo;gang of six&rdquo; senators who came up with a deficit reduction plan, Conrad has taken a tough public stand on budget cuts. However, the gang of six&rsquo;s plan, while suggesting $11 billion in cuts for from agricultural programs, left it up to the Agriculture committees to decide where to trim. The committees are a focal point for contributions from agribusiness. Conrad, who hails from a farming state with a large sugar beet contingent, is also a member of the Agriculture Committee. He has <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00004613&amp;type=I\">collected</a> more than $1 million from agribusiness during his career in Congress, and the crop production industry ranks in his top five donating industries.&nbsp; Among his top donors is American Crystal Sugar, which <a href=\"http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/01/25/american-crystal-sugar-lobbying-power-in-washington/\">benefits</a> from sugar subsidies. On Tuesday, <a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFN1E7710O120110802?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0\">Reuters reported </a>that Conrad told a gathering of the American Sugar Alliance that agriculture would need to take up some of the burden of cuts but pointed out that if the super committee does not come up with $1.5 trillion to spare by the deadline, agriculture would be &ldquo;exposed,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;We need to ensure that agriculture does not have a disproportionate share of the burden.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont. -</strong>&nbsp; Baucus has been pushing for tax reform, and <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/house/174891-tax-writers-debt-deal-wont-stand-in-way-of-code-reform\">this week he proclaimed</a> that the debt bill should not have any effect on efforts to revamp the code. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Baucus played a key role in enacting health care reform and is the key Senate lawmaker on any sort of tax reform. He&rsquo;s also taken millions from major interests with a stake in the debate, with <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00004643&amp;type=I_\">his top five</a> contributing industries looking like a who&rsquo;s who of industry groups that will be lobbying intensely: lawyers and law firms; Wall Street (securities &amp; investment); insurance; health professionals; and lobbyists. During the health care debate, <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2009/06/22/the-max-baucus-health-care-lobbyist-complex/\">Sunlight reported&nbsp;</a> his close ties to health care lobbyists. These include<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=15051\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lobbyist.php?id=Y00000402241&amp;year=2011\">David Castagnetti</a><a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=15051\">,</a> a former chief of staff who represents a long list of health care companies such as Humana Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, and Procter and Gamble, but also others such as Koch Industries and Wal-Mart Stores. Castagnetti has donated to a Super PAC that supports Obama and is a regular as a <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Host/Castagnetti/\">host for Democratic Washington fundraisers.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. - </strong>Schumer was a strong advocate for lifting the debt ceiling. Hailing from New York, Schumer has always collected a lot of Wall Street cash. His <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00001093&amp;cycle=Career\">top career donors </a>are Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. The senator also raised hundreds of millions for the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/parties/totals.php?cmte=DSCC&amp;cycle=2006\">Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee</a>&nbsp;when he was chairman in the 2006 and 2008 election cycles. And he serves on both the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and the Senate FInance Committee. Among the lobbyists who have contributed to his campaigns are <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Host/graefe/\">Fred Graefe</a>, frequent party host and Heather and John Podesta, who also host many <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Host/podesta/\">fundraisers</a> and are the<a href=\"http://www.iwatchnews.org/2011/07/28/5402/top-5-lobbyist-bundlers-power-couple-tony-and-heather-podesta-top-list\"> top reported bundlers</a> to congressional campaigns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan. - </strong>Agricultural subsidies are on the hit list for possible elimination or cut backs in deficit reduction proposals.&nbsp; Roberts, who is ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, supported the debt bill. However, agribusiness <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00005285&amp;type=I\">tops his list </a>of donating industries. His <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?id=F25241&amp;year=2011\">lobbyist campaign donors </a>include Richard F. Hohlt, who represents Atria Group, the parent company of tobacco giant Philip Morris. Koch Industries, run by conservatives Charles and David H. Koch and headquartered in Kansas, is his No. 1 career donor. The American Bankers Association and private equity firm Blackstone Group also rank among his top donors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.</strong> -&nbsp; As ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee, Sessions has <a href=\"http://sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressShop.NewsReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=8b654eb8-f59f-6c59-0712-873f11fe57ff&amp;Region_id=&amp;Issue_id=\">complained</a> vociferously that the chamber has shirked responsibility because it hasn&rsquo;t passed a budget in years. He also voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; on the compromise, saying that it does not allow for enough accountability. However, like his fellow lawmakers, Sessions rakes in campaign contributions from the same big-monied sources. He has <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00003062&amp;type=I\">taken most of his money</a> from the finance, insurance and real estate sector, and <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00003062&amp;type=I\">his top donors</a> include lawyers/law firms, health professionals, insurance and real estate. Among the lobbyists listed as hosts on his <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/party/1940/\">fundraising invitations</a> is Tim Rupli. <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/party/1940/\">Rupli</a>, who represents several financial interests, including the <a href=\"http://blog.politicalpartytime.org/2010/03/02/payday-lender-lobbyists-townhouse-is-party-central/\">payday lending industry</a>, also owns a townhouse on Capitol Hill that is a frequent site of <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Venue_Name/Rupli%20Townhouse/\">political fundraisers.</a></p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-08-03 10:17:06", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "lobbyists-dozen", "tags": "super congress, Supercongress, debt ceiling, budget, super committee", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2422, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-08-02 10:26:38", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 27, "timestamp": "2011-07-29 13:48:42", "image": "", "title": "Postponed! -- Sunlight Live to cover House Hearing on Energy Tax Policy, Tax Reform on Wednesday", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\t<strong>Editor&#39;s note: This hearing has been indefinitely postponed.

The members on these subcommittees hold varying opinions on energy tax provisions influencing public policy goals. Some question whether such an approach interferes too much with the market. Others say the tax code shouldn&#39;t subsidize energy at all.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBehind these points of view are hundreds of thousands of dollars in lobbying expenditures or campaign contributions from the energy/natural resources industry, and we&#39;ll help bring those to light as we live blog the hearing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJoining Sunlight will be John Waggoner, a reporter and columnist for <em>USA Today</em>&#39;s Money section. His books include &quot;Bailout: What the Rescue of Bear Stearns and the Credit Crisis Mean for Your Investments,&quot; while his shorter works can be found on Twitter at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/johnwaggoner\">@JohnWaggoner</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat industry, which includes oil and gas companies, is especially friendly with Republicans, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/background.php?cycle=2012&amp;ind=E\">contributing more than two-thirds of its campaign contributions to GOP candidates.</a> Meanwhile, as Sunlight <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/02/10/lobbyists-help-lower-corporate-tax-rates-for-companies-investing-in-alternative-energy/\">reported in February</a>, lobbyists have helped bring down corporate tax rates for companies investing in alternative energy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough witnesses have yet to be announced, the hearing will review existing energy tax provisions for their efficiency and effectiveness. For example, lawmakers will look at the NAT GAS Act (<a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1380:\">H.R. 1380</a>), a bill authored by Rep. John Sullivan (R-OK) that would give federal tax incentives for vehicles powered by natural gas.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAmong Sullivan&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2010&amp;cid=N00013847&amp;type=I\">top donors during the 2010 election cycle</a> was Chesapeake Energy, which gave $15,300. Various electric and power companies, including the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, chipped in with $10,000. The American Electric Power donated $8,500. Rep. Pat Tiberi (R-OH), chairman of the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures, received more than $70,000 from his top five energy donors last cycle, including American Electric Power, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cid=N00009699&amp;cycle=2010&amp;type=I&amp;newMem=N&amp;recs=100\">which ranked third on his donor list.</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2010, the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cid=N00026595&amp;cycle=2010&amp;type=I&amp;newMem=N&amp;recs=100\">second-highest donor to Rep. Charles Boustany</a> (R-LA), chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight, was a private oil &amp; gas company that gave nearly $15,000, followed by two other top-10 donors in the oil and electric utilities industries that gave a combined $28,000.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOther members on the subcommittees, <a href=\"http://transparencydata.com/contributions/#Y3ljbGU9MjAxMCZjb250cmlidXRvcl9pbmR1c3RyeT1FMDElMkMlN0NFMDclMkMmZm9yX2FnYWluc3Q9Zm9yJnJlY2lwaWVudF9mdD1OZWFs\">such as ranking members Richard E.

The firms had such a huge appetite for these investments, which brought in hefty fees and earned large bonuses for executives, that they pressed for more and more mortgages to package and sell, despite their shakiness. Meanwhile, they sunk enormous amounts into their own proprietary trading on risky derivatives. The first investment bank to keel under the pressure when mortgage-backed securities soured was Bear Stearns, after two of its hedge funds that had invested heavily in subprime mortgages went under in 2007. In March 2008, there was a run on the bank as its partners on derivatives contracts, short-term loans known as &ldquo;repos,&rdquo; and others demanded money. J.P. Morgan Chase stepped in to rescue the bank with government help to the tune of a $30 billion loan by the <a href=\"http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/maidenlane.html\">Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</a> By September, Lehman Brothers was in big trouble. Over the course of a week, two private deals to acquire the failing bank fell through. The government refused to bail out the bank, deeming it too far gone, and on Monday, Sept. 15, it filed for bankruptcy. The same day, Merrill Lynch announced it would be bought by Bank of America. On September 22, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley made it known they would become bank holding companies, a move that would subject them to more government regulation but also enable them to engage in activities that would help them raise capital, such as accepting retail deposits. The failure and reconfiguration of the big investment banks wreaked havoc on the global economy; credit virtually froze, profits plummeted, and a deep recession took hold. The survivors took tens of millions in bailout money and loans from the federal government.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Political Influence: </strong><a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?cycle=A&amp;id=D000000184#affiliates\">Bear Stearns</a>&rsquo; federal political contributions trailed off after the 2006 election cycle, while Lehman Brothers contributed $667,000 in the 2008 election cycle in contributions to federal politicians before it failed. <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?cycle=A&amp;id=D000000090\">Bank of America,</a> which acquired Merrill Lynch, contributed $1.4 million in 2010, up from $1.6 million in 2006, the previous non-presidential election cycle. Its reported f<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000090&amp;year=2008\">ederal lobbying</a> expenses peaked in 2008 at $4.9 million. <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?cycle=A&amp;id=D000000085\">Goldman Sachs</a> reported record federal lobbying in 2010, as the Dodd-Frank financial law was being debated, at $4.6 million; its federal campaign contributions totals, $1.6 million in the 2010 election cycle, however, were higher earlier in the decade. Morgan Stanley reported $2.75 million in lobbying in 2010 and $668,000 in federal campaign contributions in that election cycle, down from previous totals. Goldman Sachs is in some ways sui generis in its connections to Washington&mdash;Treasury Secretaries (Robert Rubin in the Clinton administration, Henry Paulson in the Bush administration), a U.S. Trade Representative (Robert Zoellick)&mdash;even the head of the government&rsquo;s bailout efforts under Presidents George W. Bush and, briefly, President Barack Obama (Neel Kashkari) hailed from Goldman Sachs.

The firms have had to make major changes; in anticipation of new rules regarding proprietary trading, known as the &ldquo;Volcker rule,&rdquo; both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley shut down trading desks that had been profit centers.

In its most recent federal lobbying report, the firm listed eight on-staff lobbyists who were lobbying on Dodd-Frank implementation. It also had hired several outside firms to help in its efforts, including such high powered lobbyists as GOPer <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=12314\">Kenneth Duberstein</a>; <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=35124\">former</a> House Majority Leader Rep. Dick Gephardt , D., Mo. ;&nbsp; former Senator Trent Lott, R.,&nbsp; Miss.; and Sen. John Breaux.&nbsp; The firm reported more meetings with federal agencies than any other company.

The total highlights the dominance of just a few companies providing congressional web services, a category in which five companies received 79 percent of the $5.5 million pie.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn Monday, speaking during a prime-time address, President Barack Obama asked viewers who favor a balanced deficit reduction approach to contact Congress. Several members&#39; websites stopped responding to requests soon after. A <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/issues/57_14/Obama-Request-Overloads-Websites-207700-1.html?pos=hbtxt\">Roll Call story</a> published Wednesday blamed the outage on a massive influx of traffic and, according to unnamed sources in the story identified a single vendor: Fireside21 &mdash; a web services company headquartered on K Street and helmed by a former congressional staffer, which decorates<a href=\"http://www.fireside21.com/about/\"> its website</a> with photographs of the Capitol.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2010, a little over 100 members listed web services payments to the company in disclosures. They included the offices of House Speaker John Boehner (which paid $15,970 ) and Rep. Michele Bachmann ($11,553), whose websites were reported to have gone down and have since returned on a Fireside-related server, as well as Rep. Paul Ryan ($10,139). Rep. Phil Gingrey (whose office paid $26,901 to Fireside) also suffered downtime, and he said the committee he chairs, the House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight, might look into the outages.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition to members, disbursements show payments to Fireside from six House committees, including the committees on Budget, Financial Services and Education.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe payments were for a category that includes web development, hosting, e-mail and related services, so it&#39;s unlikely the entire total went to hosting. It&#39;s also not definite that Fireside hosted the sites at the time of the outage. The disbursement records, <a href=\"http://disbursements.house.gov/\">released by the House</a> and <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/projects/expenditures/\">formatted into a searchable preadsheet</a> by Sunlight, are sometimes incomplete, and can be amended long after the fact by members.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut the payments do show the extent to which a few specialty firms dominate the congressional web services market. In this field, iConstituent was the clear 2010 leader, with more than $1.6 million in disbursements. They received payments from a little more than 140 members&#39; offices. Fireside was next with more than $1.4 million.

That scandal was uncovered by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC), a federal regulatory agency within the Department of the Interior often criticized of being understaffed and inadequate.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">\r\n\tIn April 2010, President Obama nominated Tracie Stevens, a member of the Tulalip reservation, as Chairwoman of the NIGC, replacing Philip N.

Emergency room staff <a href=\"http://www.idph.state.il.us/about/nursing_homes_violations11/1st_Quarter/Rockford%2010-C0356.pdf\">found</a> seven large bed sores on his body; some spanned several inches and had advanced to stage IV, the most severe. One wound, according to emergency room notes, was infected and covered his entire tailbone.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe man, identified in inspection reports only as &quot;R1,&quot; had developed all of his wounds since arriving at Rockford Nursing &amp; Rehab Center, a 67-bed facility in Rockford, Illinois. Bed sores -- also known as pressure ulcers -- are lesions that typically form when a patient has limited mobility, and her position isn&#39;t adjusted often enough. They can be extremely painful, and if left to fester can result in permanent loss of tissue, including muscle and tendons.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tResident 1 was far from the only victim of the poor conditions at Rockford Nursing &amp; Rehab. The health reports <a href=\"http://www.idph.state.il.us/ltc/docs/SurveyResult/6006613FA07072010.pdf\">describe</a> a culture of verbal abuse and intimidation. Unexplained bruises were found on residents. Feces and urine were left on toilets and bathroom floors. An employee yelled at a resident for &quot;pissing [him]self&quot; and &quot;cursed&quot; at others &quot;all the time.&quot; One resident reported not being given a shower for two weeks. When confronted by state inpectors, several staff members privately confessed that they were too intimidated to report bad employee behavior because some of the offenders were family members of their supervisors. &quot;It&#39;s a scary place to work,&quot; one anonymous source said. &quot;If you have concerns you can&#39;t complain because everyone is related.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were able to track down these horror stories because Medicare had flagged Rockford Nursing &amp; Rehab Center as one of the worst nursing homes in the country, a warning we found on <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/health/\">our new mobile app</a>, <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/07/26/introducing-sunlight-health/\">Sunlight Health</a>.&nbsp;From there, we investigated Rockford further using Medicare&#39;s <a href=\"http://data.medicare.gov/browse?limitTo=datasets&amp;tags=nursing+home\">Nursing Home Compare</a> <a href=\"http://www.medicare.gov/Download/DownloadDB.asp?%20language=Englishversion=\">database</a> and the Illinois Department of Public Health <a href=\"http://www.idph.state.il.us/webapp/LTCApp/ownershipinfo2.jsp?facilityid=6006613&amp;target=owner1\">website</a>, which posts some of the actual inspection reports online.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat we found in Rockford Nursing&#39;s case was shocking. Reports filed by the state health department describe a steady stream of abuse and neglect that quietly continued at the facility in the nearly two years before Medicare officials put it on the list of bad nursing homes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDuring a two-and-a-half year period ending in March, Rockford Nursing racked up a whopping 167 violations of federal nursing home standards, ranging from neglecting patients who couldn&#39;t eat or groom themselves to singling out residents who complained. In contrast, the average nursing home was dinged 34 times from roughly 2008 to 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState health inspectors had to return repeatedly over that period to see if performance had improved. A litany of complaints by residents and family members also triggered extra visits: since September 2008, inspectors reported investigating complaints a full 49 times, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health <a href=\"http://www.idph.state.il.us/webapp/LTCApp/federalsurvey.jsp?facilityid=6006613\">website</a>. Representatives from Rockford failed to respond to multiple requests for comment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile Rockford Nursing &amp; Rehab Center has a particularly bad record, it is by no means alone in having serious safety problems. Last year, according to a Sunlight analysis of Medicare data, inspectors flagged nearly 2,700 nursing homes for either hiring staff with a history of mistreating or neglecting residents, or failing to investigate suspected mistreatment or neglect. (Medicare counts both failures as a single category, so it&#39;s impossible to find out how many incidents of each occurred.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInspectors found nursing homes guilty of physically restraining residents for no medical reason over 1,100 times last year; on 2,400 occasions homes were found to be giving patients unnecessary catheters. Inspectors found that staff had allowed bed sores to form or persist over 2,700 times in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMedicare officials created a program in 1998 to separate out the worst of these facilities -- the ones that improve just enough to avoid being banned from Medicare, but are still riddled with problems. These &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/CertificationandComplianc/Downloads/SFFList.pdf\">Special Focus Facilities</a>&quot; (SFFs) are chosen from among the 15 homes in each state that did most poorly over the past three years, and are inspected twice as frequently as the rest. Less than one percent of the nation&#39;s nursing homes end up on this list.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLike Rockford Nursing &amp; Rehab Center, a disproportionate number of these homes are for-profit: 88 percent, compared to 69 percent of all US nursing homes. Most are also part of a chain of facilities that are all under the same ownership.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile the Special Focus program certainly raises red flags for anyone looking for a nursing home, questions have been raised as to whether the facilities on the list are really the worst in the nation. In 2009, the GAO, using its own methodology, <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09689.pdf\">found</a> that about half the homes with the most serious health and safety infractions were not in the program. Part of the problem, GAO found, was that Medicare pulls its list from the 15 lowest-performing facilities in each state. In reality, the worst of the bunch weren&#39;t distributed evenly across all states; some had far more than fifteen.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnfortunately, only a fraction of what actually happened at Rockford Nursing &amp; Rehab Center can be found on the web. In Illinois, only some inspection reports are published online; families must go to each individual home for the rest, or file a public records request and pay to have the reports copied.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd Illinois is among the better states when it comes to transparency for long-term care facilities. Most states don&#39;t post any inspection reports online. Last year&#39;s health care overhaul law requires that all states must begin doing so, but only a handful have complied so far.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-07-26 10:08:42", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "nursing-homes", "tags": "health care, healthcare app, nursing homes ", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2415, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-07-20 21:10:24", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 3, "timestamp": "2011-07-20 17:56:19", "image": "", "title": "Special interests lobby on the debt ceiling", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tAs Congress and the White House continue to search for a mechanism to raise the debt ceiling (the Senate &quot;gang of six&quot; have offered a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303661904576456042405686316.html\">new plan</a>&nbsp;to end the deadlock), some of the biggest spending-special interests in the country are weighing in on the issue, according to a search of new lobbying disclosure records that are being released today.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo far, at least 141 lobbying entities have cited the term &quot;debt ceiling&quot; in lobbying disclosure forms filed, a search of filings from the House and Senate websites show, compared to just three&nbsp; in the first quarter of the year.

The latest tax carrot was part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gama.aero/media-center/press-releases/content/signing-tax-bill-vital-general-aviation-manufacturers\" target=\"_blank\">December 2010 tax deal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;allowed corporate aircraft buyers to write off 100 percent of expenses related to an aircraft purchase if bought in 2011 and 2012. Previously, now-expired bonus depreciation measures were put in place by the Democrats&rsquo; $787 stimulus bill passed in early 2009 and a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h5297/show\" target=\"_blank\">job creation bill</a>&nbsp;signed in September 2010.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe companies lobbying Washington include Textron, which owns Cessna Aircraft, the firm that shipped the most business jets worldwide in 2010, according to a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gama.aero/files/GAMA_DATABOOK_2011_web.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">GAMA report</a>. They also include Hawker Beechcraft, piston maker Cirrus Aircraft, and Brazilian-owned Embraer. The trade groups are GAMA, which represents jet makers, and NBAA, which represents firms who use corporate jets<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>In their lobbying reports, all but two of these entities have reported lobbying on accelerated or bonus tax depreciation or the <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h5297/show\">September jobs bill</a> that included the measure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHubbard said Obama changed his position on the tax issue. &ldquo;We were dumbfounded by that. The Obama of 2010 said that shorter depreciation schedules were a good thing. The Obama of 2011 said that longer ones were better and in fact they&rsquo;re not long enough,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe tax benefit Obama was likely referring to, Pribyl and Hubbard said, is one that has been in the tax code for decades. The law allows buyers of corporate jets to depreciate the value of their investment over five years while commercial aircraft buyers must spread the benefit over seven years.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome of these corporate jet interests also contribute to congressional and presidential campaigns. The president himself has received about $105,000 in his career from employees of three key companies in the corporate jet business. The donations came from General Dynamics and Textron, conglomerates who own Georgia-based Gulfstream Aerospace and Kansas-based Cessna Aircraft, as well as employees of Berkshire Hathaway and NetJets, a subsidary of Berkshire, which is owned by billionaire investor and Obama ally Warren Buffett.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn all, this group of corporate jet interests have given about $10.4 million to federal candidates&#39; campaigns in the past decade, according to an analysis of CRP data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Corporate Jet Interests&#39; Campaign Donations, 2000-2010</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"300px\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?gco_chartArea=%7B%22top%22%3A%2230%22%7D&amp;containerId=gviz_canvas&amp;q=select+col0%2C+col1+from+1169927++skip+0+limit+6&amp;viz=GVIZ&amp;t=BAR&amp;width=500&amp;height=300\" width=\"500px\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPompeo, a freshman congressman who&nbsp;<a href=\"http://pompeo.house.gov/press-release/pompeo-stands-general-aviation-manufacturers\" target=\"_blank\">wrote a letter</a>&nbsp;defending the industry to House leaders earlier this month, received more contributions for the 2010 election from a batch of corporate jet interests than&nbsp;any other current member of Congress ($34,100), according to CRP data. These interests include the parent companies of the two American firms that shipped the most <a href=\"http://www.gama.aero/files/GAMA_DATABOOK_2011_web.pdf\">business jets in 2010</a>&nbsp;(Cessna and Gulfstream), and the third-best seller (Hawker Beechcraft). It also includes&nbsp;the two key industry trade groups and Berkshire Hathaway. Hawker Beechcraft, which has lobbied on the tax issue and is headquartered in Wichita, gave more to the campaigns of Pompeo and Lynn Jenkins, R-Kan.&mdash;$5,000 each&mdash;than to any other member of Congress so far this year.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPompeo&#39;s director of communications, Rachel Taylor, wrote in an email that her boss&nbsp;&quot;enjoys support from all kinds of folks who agree with his policy positions, that&rsquo;s the beauty of our democracy and the freedom of political speech.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tShe added he also used to work in the industry as the founder of Thayer Aerospace, an airplane parts manufacturer. &quot;General [a]viation is a major industry in the [c]ongressman&#39;s district&quot; and he is &quot;intimately familiar with their need for less taxation and less regulation,&quot; she wrote.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis batch of jet interests also gave more to Pompeo&rsquo;s predecessor, Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., the longtime Kansas Republican congressman, than to all but one other federal candidate over the past decade: about $150,000, according to CRP data. Only the late John Murtha, D-Penn., beat him out.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt was Tiahrt, along with former Rep.

And in 2011, lobbyists for some 488 clients are still lobbying on the bill, according to the most recent data from the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2011/06/lobbying-push-targeting-federal-reg.html\">Center for Responsive Politics.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe number of major banks, securities firms, investment banks, ratings agencies, insurers, corporations, labor unions and other groups listing the act peaked during the second quarter of 2010, when the law passed Congress, with a significant percentage of the lobbying clients still registered a full year later.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Wall Street reform bill was a mammoth undertaking, consisting of more than 2,300 pages, and requiring agencies to write a total of more than 240 new regulations.

The rule making process has been a pitched battle among consumer groups, the financial industry and regulators. And with the sheer number and complexity of these nuanced rules, several implementation deadlines have been pushed back.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are eleven different agencies and bureaus involved in the rulemaking process, and as of July 1, only 38 rules have been finalized, with 26 deadlines missed.

Goldman Sachs, one of the firms at the center of the storm, created a team of insider lobbyists between 2009 and 2010, hiring the likes of Michael Paese, former staffer to the financial reform bill&rsquo;s House sponsor, Rep.

With about $600 billion in assets, GE Capital was one of the non-bank investment companies that were prescribed for additional review under the newly created Financial Stability Oversight Council, Dodd-Frank&rsquo;s attempt to provide more supervision for &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo; banks without breaking them up. GE lobbied regulatory agencies and Congress in an attempt to roll back the more stringent oversight, records show.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe American Bankers Association, another group that has targeted regulatory agencies, disclosed spending $17 million in 2009 and 2010, and $2 million in the first quarter of 2011.

S&amp;P&rsquo;s parent company, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientissues.php?id=D000035733&amp;year=2010\">McGraw Hill</a><a href=\"http://influenceexplorer.com/organization/mcgraw-hill-companies/8aa2b7159b984329b7e85f23ab3a3cfb?cycle=2010\">,</a> has spent $3 million in the last two years. Like the other ratings agencies, Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s was faulted for giving high-risk securities investment-grade ratings. Lobbying records show that MCGraw listed &ldquo;oversight of credit ratings agencies&rdquo; as one of the main issues they worked on in the last few years. Under Dodd-Frank, firms like S&amp;P were mandated for additional oversight under the SEC, which will require ratings agencies to release reports showing their internal processes at least once a year. Additionally, Dodd-Frank mandates some checks on conflicts of interest that arise when firms like Standard and Poor&rsquo;s rate products of Wall Street firms on whom they depended for their profits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong the insurance industry the American Insurance Association was one of the most prolific lobbyists on issues related to Dodd-Frank. The new law called for Treasury to establish the Federal Insurance Office to collect data on the industry and offer a study next year on how&nbsp; to modernize the insurance industry, including consideration of moving oversight from the states to the federal level.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWith the ongoing rulemaking, Dodd-Frank issues have become a full employment opportunity for lobbyists.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLobbyists who were listed as hired guns for some of the largest banks and investment groups working on specific Dodd-Frank related issues include some of DC&rsquo;s prominent players. These include Tony and Heather Podesta, the husband-wife Democrat-leaning power lobbyists who together have contributed more than $275,000 in the 2010 election cycle.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOthers include Kenneth Kies of the Federal Policy Group who contributed about $136,000 and Lawrence O&rsquo;Brien of the OB-C group who contributed $135,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLawmakers that received the most in contributions from lobbyists who listed Dodd-Frank issues on their disclosure forms among others issues include Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who received more than $186,000 followed by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio ($154,700), Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark. ($146,400) and Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.

In June alone, government agencies reported 21 meetings with the firm--or almost one meeting for every workday that month. And on one day, June 14, Goldman Sachs representatives were present at four separate meetings with officials from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to discuss various aspects of swap trading rules and reporting.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOverall, government officials have reported more than 2,100 meetings with outside parties since the passage of the <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/show\">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a> last year. Other institutions showing up at the top of the most frequent visits list include JP Morgan Chase, with 73 meetings, Morgan Stanley, with 58 meetings, and Bank of America, with 55 meetings. These institutions, the recipients of hundreds of millions of dollars in government aid at the height of the economic meltdown, have much to gain--or lose--depending on how agencies write rules mandated&nbsp;under the new law.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile unions and advocacy groups have also made contact with financial agency officials, they have done so less often, and many of those encounters have been with Elizabeth Warren, the adviser charged with setting up the new <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB), as opposed to higher ranking agency officals. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/doddfrank/search?q=consumers+union\" target=\"_blank\">Consumers Union</a>&nbsp;attended four meetings, all of them with Warren. The conservative&nbsp;<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/doddfrank/search?q=american+enterprise+institute\" target=\"_blank\">American Enterprise Institute&nbsp;</a>logged two meetings, one with Warren. The AFL-CIO shows at a half dozen meetings, two of which were with Warren. In contrast, Goldman Sachs executives counted two meetings with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and seven with CFTC chairman Gary Gensler. Firm executives also had two meetings with Warren.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe records are culled from disclosures made the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and CFTC, which voluntarily made them public. However, each agency began its log at different points last year, and each one follows a different policy and format, making it difficult to track activity across the government. So while the CFTC, which began publishing <a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/ExternalMeetings/index.htm\">details on its meetings</a> within a week of Dodd-Frank&#39;s enactment in July 2010 and makes those records available daily, soon after the meetings occur,&nbsp;the Treasury Department did not&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/wsr/Pages/transparency.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">begin</a>&nbsp;releasing&nbsp;its logs until the following November, and posts a monthly compilation with a one-month time lag.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDespite the differences in format and release schedules, the logs reveal a wealth of information of how outside interests influence how the regulatory sausage is made. For example, representatives from the lobbying firm Delta Strategy Group, which was&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.deltastrategygroup.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">founded</a>&nbsp;in 2010 by the former chair of the CFTC, James Newsome, is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/doddfrank/organization/delta-strategy-group\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>&nbsp;present at 44 meetings, all of them at his former stamping grounds. The firm has&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?id=D000064231&amp;year=2011\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;$1.6 million from its clients since 2010, including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/doddfrank/organization/cme-group\" target=\"_blank\">CME Group</a>&nbsp;(also a former Newsome employer); the oil company&nbsp;<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/doddfrank/organization/hess-corporation\" target=\"_blank\">Hess Corporation</a>; and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/doddfrank/organization/gavilon\" target=\"_blank\">Gavilon</a>, a commodity management firm.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnother lobbying firm that shows up near the top of the list is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/doddfrank/organization/sullivan-cromwell-llp\" target=\"_blank\">Sullivan and Cromwell</a>, with 29 meetings, which has&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?id=D000000464&amp;year=2011\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>&nbsp;$680,000 in federal lobbying since 2010.

In the aftermath of the crisis, Congress passed and President Obama signed on July 21, 2010, the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to set new safeguards for the public, to rein in financial firms, to ensure oversight of new types of financial instruments, and to give regulators more tools to prevent another crisis.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Dodd-Frank act and the hundreds of rules that regulatory agencies will have to adopt in the wake of its passage have been the subject of a massive lobbying campaign by the financial firms it is supposed to regulate. Those firms are among the most generous givers of campaign contributions--since the 1992 election cycle, when Congress weakened oversight of the government-sponsored enterprises involved in the secondary mortgage market, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the finance, insurance and real estate sector <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/totals.php?cycle=2012&amp;ind=F\">has contributed more than $2.6 billion</a> to federal candidates, political action committees and parties, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Since 1999, when Congress and the Clinton administration deregulated financial firms by dismantling the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/wallstreet/weill/demise.html\">Glass-Steagall Act,</a> a Depression-era law that prevented kept banking and investment firms separate, companies and trade groups in the finance, insurance and real estate sectors spent a staggering $4.3 billion lobbying the House, Senate and executive branch agencies on a wide range of legislative and regulatory issues. In 2009 and 2010, when Dodd-Frank was under consideration, lobbyists reported some 1,172 clients with an interest in affecting the bill.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSince passage of Dodd-Frank, federal agencies implementing the law have logged more than <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/meeting-logs-story/\">2,100 meetings</a> with interests aiming to influence the many new rules that Dodd-Frank requires, including 83 with executives and lobbyists for Goldman Sachs, 73 with JP Morgan Chase, 58 with Morgan Stanley and 55 with Bank of America. The Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group is launching a new tracker to follow disclosures of meetings about <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/doddfrank\">Dodd-Frank implementation</a> with the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Corporation. Additionally, a dozen bills have been introduced to repeal the law or significantly amend it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDespite its more then 2,300 pages, Dodd-Frank left regulatory agencies to spell out most of the specifics; there are <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/financial_reuglation_deadlines_missed/\">108 rulemaking</a> deadlines this summer. That&#39;s one of the reasons lobbying on the bill has continued to pick up since it was enacted--lobbying firms reported 79 new clients interested in influencing Dodd-Frank since last July (listed <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/lobbying/search?q=dodd\">here</a>, by our <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/lobbying/registrations\">Lobbying Tracker</a>).&nbsp;Additionally, federal agencies charged with collecting and publishing new data sets&nbsp;<a href=\"\">lag behind</a>&nbsp;in making that information available to the public.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDodd-Frank&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/text?version=enr&amp;nid=t0:enr:13\">preamble</a>&nbsp;says the act&#39;s intent is to &quot;To promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end &lsquo;too big to fail&rsquo;, to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.&quot; In the coming days, we&#39;ll look at each of the major segments contributing to the financial crisis, and look at how Dodd-Frank effects them, and how they&#39;ve affected implementation of Dodd-Frank in return.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIndustry influence over Congress and regulatory agencies played a key role in the financial crisis that culminated in an unprecedented <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h1424/show\">bail out</a> of big banks, brokerages, government-sponsored enterprises, and auto manufacturers in the fall of 2008 and <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s1/show\">another</a> of state and local governments in the winter of 2009. It had its beginnings in a series of laws and regulations adopted by the federal government after heavy lobbying by special interests to deregulate Wall Street stretching as far back, <a href=\"http://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-reports/fcic_final_report_full.pdf\">in some accounts</a>, for decades.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission&#39;s majority noted in its <a href=\"http://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-reports/fcic_final_report_full.pdf\">report</a> on the origins of the crisis:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\tIn the early part of the 20th century, we erected a series of protections&mdash;the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort, federal deposit insurance, ample regulations&mdash;to provide a bulwark against the panics that had regularly plagued America&rsquo;s banking system in the 19th century. Yet, over the past 30-plus years, we permitted the growth of a shadow banking system&mdash;opaque and laden with short-term debt&mdash;that rivaled the size of the traditional banking system. Key components of the market&mdash;for example, the multi-trillion-dollar repo lending market, off-balance-sheet entities, and the use of over-the-counter derivatives&mdash;were hidden from view, without the protections we had constructed to prevent financial meltdowns.</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2009/04/01/read-the-bill-the-commodity-futures-modernization-act/\">One chapter</a> of that lengthy story was the passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act in 2000, a 262-page long bill that was tucked into an 11,000-page behemoth conference report, with little debate or oversight. Thanks to the efforts of Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and others, provisions to regulate derivatives markets and credit default swaps--proposed after the collapse and rescue of hedge fund <a href=\"http://www.erisk.com/learning/casestudies/long-termcapitalmanagemen.asp\">Long Term Capital Management</a>--were stripped from the final version of the bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition to the changes to the financial sector, Republicans and Democrats in the White House and Congress favored homeownership with tax breaks and generously supported government-sponsored enterprises to facilitate the market. In 1992, Congress enacted the <a href=\"http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/12C46.txt\">Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act</a>, which set up a new regulatory regime for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the congressionally created firms that kept the mortgage market flush with cash by buying mortgages from banks, replenishing their capital to write new mortgages. The bill, among other things, required Fannie and Freddie to take the lead in &quot;developing loan products and flexible underwriting guidelines to facilitate a secondary market for mortgages for very low-, low-, and moderate-income families.&quot; In an effort to increase home ownership in the United States, the two government-sponsored enterprises would begin supplying subprime mortgage lenders with a seemingly endless stream of financing. Mortgage brokers soon followed suit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne of the segments of the housing market that the act encouraged GSEs to expand was manufactured housing, which went through a crisis starting in 1997. Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway has a subsidiary in the industry, <a href=\"http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2008ltr.pdf\">wrote to his shareholders in February 2009</a>, that that experience, &quot;should have served as a canary-in-the-coal-mine warning for the far-larger conventional housing market.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBuffett explained that mortgage originators made loans to more and more questionable customers which were then turned into securities--mortgage-backed securities--that were sold to investors. &quot;In an eerie rerun of that disaster, the same mistakes were repeated with conventional homes in the 2004-07 period,&quot; Buffett wrote, &quot;Lenders happily made loans that borrowers couldn&rsquo;t repay out of their incomes, and borrowers just as happily signed up to meet those payments.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy that time, the financial industry had undergone significant changes thanks to a 1999 law--the <a href=\"http://banking.senate.gov/conf/\">Financial Modernization Act</a>, or Gramm-Leach-Bliley--passed by a Republican Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. The law eliminated Depression-era rules designed to protect the country from the collapse of any one institution by keeping banking separate from investment firms, and was later strengthened to prevent banks from engaging in other types of business or growing too large through mergers and acquisitions. Data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation show what happened next: in 1999, the year the law passed, the 10 largest commercial banks held 27 percent of the commercial bank deposits; by 2005, their share had climbed to 44 percent. In June of 2010, the last year for which data was available, the top ten banks held 47 percent of commercial bank deposits.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFederal policy encouraged more home ownership through flexible underwriting guidelines, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac primed the pump by buying up billions of dollars worth of mortgages and repackaging the loans to investors, mortgage originators made sketchier and sketchier loans to customers, then sold them to the GSEs or to brokerage houses, all of which packaged them as mortgage backed securities that ratings agencies labeled &quot;investment grade.&quot; The amount of debt issued was staggering: Gretchen Morgenson and Joshua Rosner reported in their book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Reckless-Endangerment-Outsized-Corruption-Armageddon/dp/0805091203/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1310763371&amp;sr=8-1\">Reckless Endangerment</a> that by 2005, investors held $4 trillion in debt guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. U.S. Treasury debt at the time amounted to $4.7 trillion. Brokerages and banks sold the securities to investors, which ranged from big banks to union pension funds to insurers to individuals, in more and more complex configurations, including collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), CDOs squared and CDOs cubed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTraders in CDOs hedged their bets through derivatives, credit default swaps, and other mechanisms, like the credit support annexes that insurance giant American International Group gave that guaranteed the value of CDOs. When the value collapsed, the federal government <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/20080916a.htm\">effectively</a> took over AIG on Sept. 16, 2008, about <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/20089711172217483.aspx\">two weeks</a> after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were seized and two days after <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/806085/000110465908059632/a08-22764_4ex99d1.htm\">Lehman Brothers</a> declared bankruptcy, and Bank of America <a href=\"http://mediaroom.bankofamerica.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=234503&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1390130&amp;highlight=\">announced</a> it was acquiring Merrill Lynch.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose moves occurred in an atmosphere of financial crisis, as firms, fearing the equivalent of a bank run, sought to hold on to their own capital and refused to lend to others. Banks that borrowed money short term to help employers meet payrolls had difficulty raising capital. The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. took measures in October 2008 to guarantee such loans, while Congress rushed through the <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h1424/show\">Emergency Economic Stabilization Act</a>, which authorized the federal government to spend up to $700 billion to buy toxic assets from financial institutions, restoring them to fiscal health (for a summary of government actions to aid the financial industry in 2008 and 2009, visit <a href=\"http://subsidyscope.org/bailout/\">Subsidy Scope</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe crisis affected more than big banks and financial firms. In 2010, there were almost 7 million fewer jobs than in 2007, <a href=\"http://bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea01.htm\">according to</a> the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2008, the percentage of individual returns with taxable income filed with Internal Revenue Service fell to 63.6 percent, down from 74.8 percent in 2000, according to the <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/indtaxstats/article/0,,id=96981,00.html\">Statistics of Income</a> division of the IRS. That occurred as Congress authorized the Treasury Department to bail out banks and other financial industry players with up to $700 billion from taxpayers. Congress and the Obama administration tried to address the ensuing recession by spending another $787 billion for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in order to stimulate employment and plug holes in state and local budgets caused by their own collapsing tax revenues.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-07-18 11:31:34", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "dodd-frank-will-bill-overturn-decades-industry-influence", "tags": "Dodd-Frank, financial reform, Elizabeth Warren, treasury meetings, lobbying, CFTB, Consumer Finance Protection Bureau", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2402, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-08-18 17:35:21", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 22, "timestamp": "2011-07-14 17:56:54", "image": "", "title": "Agencies slow to provide new data required by Dodd-Frank", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tOne year after passing Dodd Frank Financial reform, much of the work of reforming America&rsquo;s financial system still lies ahead. This is not too surprising considering the&nbsp;sheer size of the legislation. The law created 243 rules and requires agencies to produce 67 studies, according to <a href=\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/2010/07/15/summary-and-implementation-schedule-of-the-dodd-frank-act/\">Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation</a>. One-hundred-twenty-two deadlines are <a href=\"http://www.davispolk.com/files/uploads/FIG//July2011_Dodd.Frank.Progress.Report.pdf\">due</a> between July 16 and July 21.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe law also requires agencies to make new data from disclosures filed by financial firms public, but to do so agencies must overcome obstacles such as lack of funding and limited bureaucratic capacity. The law mandated few concrete deadlines to keep these efforts on track. A Sunlight review of government efforts so far reveals that most databases seem half completed or have not been started yet. For example, Congress mandated a foreclosure database but has still not funded the project. Over the past year, the nascent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was in the process of setting up the organization tasked with making the foreclosure data available. The success of creating a National Appraisal Registry is undermined by the lack of public access to all the information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>DATA SETS</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Dodd Frank financial reform created four public databases as part of an attempt to increase oversight and prevent another financial meltdown. These datasets were to track foreclosures, consumer complaints, financial institutions and a national appraisal registry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was tasked with establishing a publicly available database of information on foreclosures and defaults on mortgage loans.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe Bureau of Consumer Financial Information must establish a consumer complaints database.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe Financial Stability Oversight Council is required to publish a financial company reference database, a financial instrument reference database, and formats and standards for data.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe bill also created a National Appraisal Registry.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n\tImplementation on all these datasets is progressing at a snails pace.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Foreclosure Database</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Department of Housing and Urban Development was tasked with establishing a <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/text?version=enr&amp;nid=t0:enr:13225\">publicly available database</a> of information on foreclosures and defaults on mortgage loans. While Congress set high goals for HUD to track foreclosures, there was little follow through to fund these mandates, according to a HUD spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to Brian Sullivan in HUD&#39;s office of public affairs, &quot;The main obstacles to complete the foreclosure database are the lack of appropriations to create the database and the lack of statutory authority to compel the reporting to HUD of information necessary to compile localized loan performance data. So far, Congress has not funded the foreclosure database. HUD requested funding for the database as part of its 2012 proposed budget.&quot; He continued, &quot;HUD currently monitors home loan performance by using private sector data sources like the Mortgage Bankers Association, CoreLogic, and Lender Processing Services (LPS/McDash) data.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Consumer Complaint Database</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe newly formed agency under Dodd Frank, the CFPB, has yet to make comments on the <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/text?version=enr&amp;nid=t0:enr:10115\">Consumer Complaint Database</a>&nbsp;available to the public. There is currently a <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/get-help-now/\">web resource</a> that helps consumers find out where to resolve their complaints. The CFPB gets its funding independently, so it is not up against the same budgetary restrictions as HUD. The CFPB&rsquo;s largest hurdle to fulfilling its duties at this point may be appointing a director. Elizabeth Warren is setting up the CFPB but no director has been confirmed. Even <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0611/57142.html\">without a director</a>, the CFPB will be able to open its doors, but it will only be able to enforce existing laws and not be able to form new regulations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Financial Databases</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) currently provides access to some filings on its <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html\">EDGAR</a> database. Dodd-Frank has a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/text?version=enr&amp;nid=t0:enr:1102\">requirement</a>&nbsp;that the SEC create a Data Center that provides the public &ldquo;financial instrument reference database.&rdquo; The SEC, to fulfill that requirement, must &nbsp;&ldquo;prepare and publish, in a manner that is easily accessible to the public (i) a financial company reference database; (ii) a financial instrument reference database; and (iii) formats and standards for Office data, including standards for reporting financial transaction and position data to the Office.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>National Appraisal Registry</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"https://www.asc.gov/National-Registry/NationalRegistry.aspx\">National Appraisal Registry</a> gives grants to State appraisers to help ensure that appraisal data is collected. The data is not universally accessible. The public can make general queries but the website states, &ldquo;In general, unless you are an ASC-authorized State appraiser regulatory agency official, you will not be able to access information regarding National Registry Numbers and disciplinary actions other than revocations, suspensions, and voluntary surrenders in lieu of disciplinary action. The National Registry reports as public information active disciplinary actions that limit an appraiser&rsquo;s ability to appraise (current revocations, suspensions, and voluntary surrenders in lieu of discipline).&rdquo; This seem to fulfill the <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/text?version=enr&amp;nid=t0:enr:13512\">requirement</a> of bill. The ASC, or <a href=\"https://www.asc.gov/Home.aspx\">Appraisal Subcommittee</a>, is part of the <a href=\"http://www.ffiec.gov/\">Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council</a>&nbsp;(FFIEC), which was established in 1979 to develop &quot;uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS).&quot; In 1980, Congress gave the FFIEC the task of making public information required under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, including data that allows researchers to examine lenders&#39; mortgage offerings to poor and minority borrowers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;<strong>REPORTS and RULES trackers</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere are a few tools to track Dodd Frank reports and regulations. The St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank has made a comprehensive <a href=\"http://www.stlouisfed.org/regreformrules/\">tracker</a> of Dodd Frank reforms. It outlines updates, rules and resources. The American Banker&rsquo;s Association also created a simpler Dodd Frank <a href=\"http://regreformtracker.aba.com/p/dodd-frank-calendar.html\">calendar</a> outlining programs, decisions and reports. The law firm, Davis Polk provides a <a href=\"http://www.davispolk.com/Dodd-Frank-Rulemaking-Progress-Report/\">monthly evaluation</a> of Dodd Frank Deadlines.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Securities and Exchange Commission provides a Dodd Frank <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/dodd-frank/dfactivity-upcoming.shtml\">implementation timeline</a>. It lists provisions of the bill and when the SEC expects to implement them. Upcoming rules include, standardization of the credit rating process, limitation of proprietary trading and elimination of some conflicts of interest within hedge funds. &nbsp;The SEC will also deliver a report on the deficiencies of its Inspector General.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) lists <a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/ReportsandStudies/index.htm\">reports and studies</a> it produces in compliance with the Dodd Frank Act. Reports include Abusive Swaps and the impact of the CFTC&rsquo;s FOIA exemption. The CFTC also has a <a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/Dodd-FrankProposedRules/index.htm\">list</a> of proposed and final rules. Two of the rules up for comment will define &ldquo;swaps&rdquo; and &ldquo;swap dealers&rdquo; and decide the Capital Requirements for Swap Dealers. Credit default swaps were seen by many as a root cause of the current depression.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Federal Insurance Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) maintains a website of <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/reform/initiatives.html\">initiatives</a> under the Dodd-Frank. An upcoming rule that has gotten much attention is the Credit Risk Retention or &quot;Skin in the game&quot; rule that requires banks to keep a fraction of the loans they originate. Regulators hope such a rule could dissuade lenders from making loans that are doomed to fail. Members of Congress and various real estate, construction and financial institutions <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/lawmakers-seeking-laxer-mortgage-rules-backed-by-housing-dollars/\">are fighting</a> for a less restrictive standard.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) created a <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/Documents/FSOC%20Integrated%20Roadmap%20-%20October%201.pdf\">report</a> of how it plans on implementing Dodd Frank. The FSOC will soon be making its first report to Congress. A list of <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/Pages/FSOC-index.aspx\">FSOC initiatives</a> are available on the Treasury website. This includes the minutes from FSOC meetings.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe acting Comptroller of the Currency, John Walsh, gave <a href=\"http://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/congressional-testimony/2011/pub-test-2011-19-written.pdf\">testimony</a> on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) plans to implement the Dodd Frank restructuring. The OCC also released a <a href=\"http://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2011/nr-occ-2011-62.html\">description</a> of the transfer of responsibilities as outlined in Dodd Frank.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau outlines its <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/timeline/\">implementation timetable</a> on its website making note of the milestones it reaches. The CFPB has not yet made any regulations. It cannot legally begin that until July 21. It <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/GC-letter-re-1071.pdf\">officially announced</a> that in regards to Small Business Data Collection outlined in Dodd Frank it is &ldquo;Waiting to commence information collection until implementing regulations are in place.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Federal Reserve provides a <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/reform_milestones.htm\">list</a> of completed and planed initiatives.

The Goldwater Institute <a href=\"http://www.goldwaterinstitute.org/article/5948\">filed suit</a> against IPAB on constitutional grounds in April, charging it will usurp Congress&#39; legislative function. Two bills introduced in the <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-452\">House</a> and <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s112-668\">Senate</a> earlier this year would repeal that section of the health care reform act; a few Democrats have signed on to co-sponsor the House bill.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLast month, the battle of words accelerated as well. Opponents gathered <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/health-reform-implementation/168407-270-healthcare-groups-back-ipab-repeal\">270 signatures</a> on a letter supporting repeal, including groups representing doctors and other care providers, device and drug manufacturers and some patients&#39; groups. A <a href=\"http://nchc.org/sites/default/files/resources/Document.pdf\">previous letter</a> supporting IPAB gathered about 100 signers, primarily policy experts and economists.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAmong the detractors was a spokesperson for AARP, who told the Sunlight Foundation, &quot;We have serious concerns about any proposal relying on arbitrary spending limits.&quot; (The AARP did not sign on to last month&#39;s letter supporting repeal.) Supporters say the complexity of health care finance requires a dedicated panel of experts in the field -- and they charge that Congress has passed few measures to rein in health care spending in the past.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-07-14 10:10:24", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "controversy-heats-over-medicare-cost-cutting-board", "tags": "IPAB, PPACA, AARP, Rep.

In June alone, 21 meetings with the firm were reported, at the rate of one every other day. And on one recent day alone, June 14, Goldman Sachs representatives present at four separate meetings at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to discuss various aspects of swap trading rules and reporting.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOverall, government officials have reported more than 2,100 meetings since the passage of the Dodd-Frank law since last year. Other institutions showing up at the top of the most frequent visits list are JP Morgan Chase, with 73 meetings, Morgan Stanley, with 58 meetings, and Bank of America, with 55 meetings. These institutions, the recipients of hundreds of millions of dollars in government aid at the height of the financial meltdown, have much to gain--or lose--depending on how agencies write mandated rules under the new law.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile consumer, union, and advocacy groups have also made contact with financial agency officials, they have done so less often and many of those encounters have been with Elizabeth Warren, the adviser charged with setting up the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), as opposed to higher ranking agency officals. For example, <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightlabs.com/doddfrank/search?q=consumers+union\">Consumers Union</a> is shown at four meetings, all of them with Warren. The conservative <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightlabs.com/doddfrank/search?q=american+enterprise+institute\">American Enterprise Institute </a>logged two meetings, one with Warren. The AFL-CIO shows at a half dozen meetings, two of which were with Warren. In contrast, Goldman Sachs executives counted two meetings with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and seven with CFTC chairman Gary Gensler. Firm executives also had two meetings with Warren.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese records are made available from the financial agencies, which made them public in the spirit of transparency. However, each agency began its log at different&nbsp; points in the last year, and each one follows a different policy and format, making it difficult to track activity across the government. On one end of the spectrum is the CFTC, which logged its first meeting within a week of the passage of Dodd Frank. The agency also makes records available after they occur, <a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/ExternalMeetings/index.htm\">here</a>. On the other is the Treasury Department, which <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/wsr/Pages/transparency.aspx\">began</a> its logs in November, and posts a compilation monthly, but only after a one-month time lag.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNevertheless, the logs reveal a wealth of information of how regulatory sausage is being made. For example, representatives from the lobbying firm Delta Strategy Group, which was <a href=\"http://www.deltastrategygroup.com/about\">founded</a> in 2010 by the former chair of the CFTC, James Newsome, is <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightlabs.com/doddfrank/organization/delta-strategy-group\">reported</a> present at 44 meetings, all of them at his former stamping grounds. The firm has <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?id=D000064231&amp;year=2011\">reported</a> $1.6 million in federal lobbying contracts since 2010, representing such clients as <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightlabs.com/doddfrank/organization/cme-group\">CME Group</a> (also a former Newsome employer); the oil company <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightlabs.com/doddfrank/organization/hess-corporation\">Hess Corporation</a>; and <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightlabs.com/doddfrank/organization/gavilon\">Gavilon</a>, a commodity management firm.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnother firm that shows up near the top of the list is <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightlabs.com/doddfrank/organization/sullivan-cromwell-llp\">Sullivan and Cromwell</a>, with 29 meetings, which has <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?id=D000000464&amp;year=2011\">reported</a> $680,000 in federal lobbying since 2010. The firm is home to partner H. Rodgin Cohen. While not registered as a lobbyist, Cohen is <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/rodge-cohen-the-trauma-surgeon-of-wall-street/\">called</a> the &quot;dean of the Wall Street lawyers,&quot; by the New York Times, who helped provide key advice to government officals in structuring the financial bailout--and who <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:utfpXsc-rp0J:www.sullcrom.com/cohenhrodgin/+rodgin+cohen+bank+clients&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=www.google.com\">counts</a> many big banks as clients.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOverall, <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightlabs.com/doddfrank/search?q=elizabeth+warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a> averaged more reported meetings by,18, than any other government official.

Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., when the congressman accused Warren of misleading the committee. The contentious hearing turned nasty when the two got into an argument about Warren&#39;s schedule.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThursday&#39;s hearing promises to pick up where the May 24 session left off. In scheduling Warren for Thursday, the committee&#39;s chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., requested that Warren clear her &quot;schedule for the full day of the hearing.&quot; The hearing is currently <a href=\"http://oversight.house.gov/index.php?option=com_jcalpro&amp;Itemid=1&amp;extmode=view&amp;extid=306\">scheduled</a> from 9:30 to 11:30.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe CFPB is charged with protecting consumers from abusive and misleading financial practices. Some members of Congress, such as Issa, worry that the CFPB has too much power and could stifle financial businesses.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIndeed, in Issa&#39;s letter to Warren, the congressman <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/59883133\">quoted</a> one of the May 24 witnesses, Professor Todd Zywicki: &quot;If not subject to effective congressional oversight, the massive, vaguely defined powers and expansive reach of the new consumer credit &#39;super regulator&#39; could prove and economy killer, producing still-higher credit costs for consumers, and accelerating regulator pressures that drive consumers out of the mainstream financial system and into the alternative, high-cost financial sector.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tProfessor Zywicki has also <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/EMStaticPage/100306?page=Summary\">concluded</a>, &quot;If you were to get out a textbook of how to create a dysfunctional agency designed to capture and implement every single pathology of a Washington bureaucracy that has been studied and identified over the past twenty years, you would design the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, what will happen this Thursday?

Ike Skelton, D-Mo.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn exchange for that gift, some of the company&#39;s top executives were placed at Skelton&#39;s table and all were given the chance to address the V.I.P. crowd that included many top military officials. The event benefited a charity for families of fallen soldiers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis kind of lavish corporate spending on galas bestowing awards on executive or legislative officials is common practice in Washington, D.C., and unlike other forms of giving&mdash;such as donations from companies&rsquo; political action committees&mdash;it is unlimited. But the donations are supposed to be reported if they come from lobbyists or their clients.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn all, lobbying entities&mdash;including lobbying firms and their clients&mdash;<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/lobbyists-honorary-gifts-federal-officials/\">reported spending $50.2 million</a> on so-called honorary and meetings fees over 2009 and 2010, according to a Sunlight Foundation analysis.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"605\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/honorees/index.html\" style=\"overflow: hidden; margin=10px\" width=\"590\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t[<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/lobbyists-honorary-gifts-federal-officials/\"><b>Learn more about the data used in this graphic and embed it on your site</b></a>]</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf the over $50 million in these reports, firms employing lobbyists spent $36.3 million honoring members of Congress and $11 million honoring executive branch officials in 2009 and 2010, according to Sunlight&rsquo;s analysis. In addition, nearly $645,000 went to legislative branch employees&mdash;mostly congressional staffers&mdash;the reports showed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese reports, which are filed with the secretary of the Senate and House clerk&rsquo;s office every six months, do not just include sponsoring an awards dinner where a trade association honors its legislator of the year. They also cover underwriting a conference or retreat held by officials, donating to a lawmaker&rsquo;s charity and even giving to a nonprofit where a lawmaker sits on the board of directors. These situations, and some others, all fall under what the rule-makers&mdash;the Senate secretary and House clerk&mdash;call honorary and meeting expenses.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Sunlight Foundation compiled these reports, finding how much each lobbying entity spent and how much each honoree received over 2009 and 2010. In cases where more than one official was honored, the amount of the gift was divided between the honorees.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>The biggest donors</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf all the companies registered to lobby during those years, oil and gas industry giant Chevron spent more than any other&mdash;about $2.9 million&mdash;honoring officials. The second biggest contributor was Wal-Mart, which donated $2.2 million to nonprofits in honor of lawmakers, including about $1 million over two years to the charitable arm of the Congressional Black Caucus. The retail giant was the CBC Foundation&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.cbcfinc.org/images/pdf/2009cbcfannualreport.pdf\">largest donor in 2009</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome of the individual payments are well into the six figures. For instance, Coca-Cola paid $250,000 to sponsor an annual prayer breakfast during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation&rsquo;s annual legislative conference in September 2009. The Distilled Spirits Council of America spent over $160,000 on a lavish <a href=\"http://washingtonscene.thehill.com/party-events-pictures/archive/6531-the-distilled-spirits-councils-annual-qspirit-of-mount-vernonq-dinner-and-auction\">annual celebration</a> which inducted Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky., a congressional friend to liquor makers, to the George Washington Spirits Society in October 2010, records show. And the seniors&rsquo; group AARP spent nearly $200,000 to honor Elizabeth Warren, the leader of the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, at its annual Inspire Awards.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSometimes the large donations go towards honoring lawmakers directly responsible for overseeing the donor&rsquo;s industry. As <a href=\"http://www.taps.org/friends/gala.aspx?id=4841\">presenting sponsors</a> at last year&rsquo;s Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors gala, the chief executive of Triwest Healthcare Alliance, a senior executive of BAE Systems, and the wife of SAIC&rsquo;s chief executive, were placed at a head table beside Rep. Skelton,&nbsp;members of his family, and others,&nbsp;according to a seating chart read by the charity&#39;s spokeswoman, Ami Neiberger-Miller. Before losing his re-election last year, Skelton chaired the House committee responsible for overseeing the Department of Defense.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\r\n<p>\r\n\tExecutives from each company, along with the Oshkosh Corporation&mdash;which was a presenting sponsor but <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/some-lobbyists-gifts-lawmakers-pet-causes-remain-dark/\">did not disclose the gift</a>&mdash;were entitled to make opening remarks to the audience, which included chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen. The contractors also got their logos printed on the electronic and print materials for the event.</p>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat kind of visibility is likely good for business, said Scott Celley, a spokesman for the Triwest Healthcare Alliance, which administers the military&#39;s healthcare program in Western states. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably true. It&rsquo;s certainly a benefit for our top level military officials to know that we do have that kind of engagement&mdash;that we are supporting the troops beyond what we are required to do,&rdquo; Celley said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut, Celley added, Triwest donates because the money goes to widows and children. &ldquo;We are pleased to participate with a variety of organizations that support our troops and families. They may or may not have important people attending the events but their mission is to take care of our troops and their families,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNot all of the top spending entities are corporate, with two of the biggest being the senior group AARP and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal workers, one of the biggest spenders on advertizing to impact the 2010 congressional elections.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf the $742,000 AARP reported spending to honor officials in 2009 and 2010, $119,000 went to the Alliance for Health Reform, a nonprofit healthcare reform advocacy group founded by Sen. John. Rockefeller, D-W.V.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHalf of that money went towards sponsoring two briefings aimed at congressional staffers in the heat of the debate over health care reform. One briefing was a March 2010 event exploring the benefits of patient engagement moderated by one of AARP&rsquo;s lobbyists, John Rother.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tChevron, the biggest corporate spender honoring officials, sponsored separate dinners for two senior regulators of the oil and gas industry. One gift went to the Environmental Law Institute in honor of EPA Administrator <a href=\"http://www.eli.org/dinner/about.cfm\">Lisa Jackson</a> and another celebrated Secretary of Energy <a href=\"http://asiasociety.org/centers/washington-dc/dc-2009-awards-dinner\">Steven Chu</a> at the Asia Society.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Pharmaceutical companies fete a favorite</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe pharmaceutical industry&rsquo;s favorite senator, if measured by the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=H04&amp;recipdetail=S&amp;sortorder=A&amp;cycle=2010\">sector&#39;s contributions</a> in 2009 and 2010, is Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The industry lined up to support the nonprofit Alliance for Aging Research last fall when Burr, along with Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., was honored.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough money from Pfizer, Eli Lilly and others was not bound for Burr&rsquo;s campaign account, some of the <a href=\"http://www.agingresearch.org/content/calendar/detail/2540\">benefits of sponsorship</a> look quite similar to many congressional fundraisers. For $20,000, the amount Pfizer paid, the company got ten tickets to a V.I.P. reception with the North Carolina senator before the dinner. For $25,000, the amount that Eli Lilly donated, executives also got to present the award on stage.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;The larger sponsors get more places in the V.I.P. reception and it&rsquo;s a smaller reception than the large one and so there&rsquo;s more likelihood that they&rsquo;re going to be able to make chitchat with prominent people,&rdquo; Alliance for Aging Research president Daniel Perry said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn all, four big pharmaceutical companies and the industry&rsquo;s main trade group chipped in a total of $75,000 for the cause, according to lobbying reports, and the senators&rsquo; presence helped attract the money, Perry said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;I think having a prominent member of Congress to talk about health policy, national needs and so on is more attractive to them than having a doo-wop group,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Limitations of the lobbying reports</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough compliance with the lobbyist reports has improved since 2008, according to Brett Kappel, a lawyer at Arent Fox who advises companies on rules, it remains a challenge for some lobbying entities.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;There are some organizations that over report and substantially more under reporting,&rdquo; Kappel said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;The [lobbyist contribution forms] and the guidance are not absolutely clear-cut,&rdquo; he added.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSunlight&rsquo;s analysis found that many lobbying registrants appear confused with how to fill out the forms. Of the $50.2 million in the reports, there are $2.2 million worth of reports that either appear unnecessary or where it is difficult to tell who is being honored.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn some of these cases, lobbying entities filed reports of donations in honor of politicians who are not covered under the rules&mdash;such as state officials and candidates. Other times, organizations instead of individuals were listed as honorees. Many other kinds of errors were made as well.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-07-12 08:28:47", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "lobbyists-pay-millions-honor-congress-executive-branch", "tags": "LD203, nonprofits, lawmakers' charities, Ike Skelton, Richard Burr, pharmaceutical industry, lobbying, Triwest Healthcare, Oshkosh, BAE Systems, SAIC, Senate Secretary, House Clerk, Wal-Mart, Chevron  ", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2379, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-07-14 10:28:54", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 25, "timestamp": "2011-06-20 17:57:38", "image": "", "title": "Some lobbyists\u2019 gifts to lawmakers' pet causes remain in the dark", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tIn the past two years, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have donated tens of thousands of dollars to a Florida nonprofit where congresswoman Corrine Brown, D-Fla., serves on the board of directors.

Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Patty Murray, D-Wash., helped separate nonprofits get off the ground. But because they did not incorporate the organizations, the law does not mandate reporting of these gifts, according to Brett Kappel, a lawyer at Arent Fox who advises companies on lobbying reports. The law does state that lobbying entities must report all donations to entities &ldquo;established, financed, maintained or controlled&rdquo; by a legislative or executive branch official.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>[<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/lobbyists-honorary-gifts-federal-officials/\">See an interactive graphic of lobbyists&#39; honorary donations in 2009 and 2010</a>]</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe law, part of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, also leaves companies and organizations uncertain of whether to disclose a gift, lawyers said, and some contributions that should have been reported were not, according to the Sunlight Foundation&rsquo;s reporting.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCompanies&rsquo; uncertainty would be assuaged if they could receive formal, written guidance from a federal agency, said Laurence E. Gold of Trister, Ross, Schadler &amp; Gold, who represents unions and other political organizations. The Senate secretary and the House clerk simply provide voluntary guidance on the disclosure laws.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Lawmakers&rsquo; pet charities</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/lobbyists-honorary-gifts-federal-officials/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/reporting/uploads/ld203-thumb.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: right; width: 300px; height: 312px; \" /></a>For certain charities&mdash;where it appears clear that a lawmaker established the nonprofit&mdash;many lobbyists&rsquo; donations are reported. Lobbying companies and trade associations gave $195,000 for the annual <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/56949206/The-Boehner-Liberman-Williams-Dinner-for-Consortium-of-Catholic-Acadamies\">Boehner-Lieberman-Williams Dinner</a> last year, which benefits four Washington, D.C. Catholic schools, according to contribution reports. The dinner was co-founded by Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and is hosted by Boehner, Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and former Washington, D.C. mayor Anthony Williams.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn other cases, where a lawmaker has a less formal association to a nonprofit, many donations likely go unreported. Sen. Hatch helped found and serves as the main draw to the annual golf fundraiser for the Utah Families Foundation. But because he did not establish the nonprofit, lobbyists are not required to report their donations to it, according to Kappel.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Established would mean that they would have to be an officer or director&mdash;not just encouraging or even helping them raise funds,&rdquo; Kappel said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Sen. Murray&rsquo;s pet charity</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough Sen. Murray did not found the Washington State Farmworker Housing Trust, it is hard to see it getting off the ground without her. Nearly a decade ago, Washington&rsquo;s senior senator urged advocates, growers and others to start a group advocating for the rights of farm workers because there was &ldquo;little if any agreement between employers and labor and farm worker advocates over how to address the housing needs of the workforce,&rdquo; the Trust&rsquo;s executive director Brien Thane said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFrom her position on the Senate appropriations subcommittee responsible for Housing and Urban Development, she secured the <a href=\"http://murray.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=NewsReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=fb0bc761-c460-4e5e-a193-db088b97ff6c&amp;ContentType_id=0b98dc1b-dd08-4df2-adac-21f6ae03beed&amp;Group_id=97a054dd-8a74-4cd0-8771-fbc3be733874&amp;YearDisplay=2003\">earmark</a> of about $180,000 to get the group started. It was the group&rsquo;s first seed money, said Brien Thane, the Trust&rsquo;s executive director.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;She told me and the founding board that she was going to help us get established that way,&rdquo; Thane said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMurray&rsquo;s connection to the Trust has continued. The charity told Sen. Murray that it would always like a member of her staff on the board so &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got a simple line of communication,&rdquo; Thane said. To this day, Murray&#39;s Washington state director serves as an ex-oficio, non-voting member of the board of directors.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe senator has also obtained two other earmarks for the group. Her spokesman, Matt McAlvanah, wrote in an email that &quot;any implication that the Trust serves any purpose for Senator Murray beyond her interest in improving the lives of Washington state&#39;s farmworkers is completely baseless.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDespite Murray&rsquo;s ties to the group, lobbying entities&#39; donations to it are not required to be disclosed. The <a href=\"http://www.farmworkerhousingtrust.org/about_funding.html\">charity&rsquo;s donors</a> include the foundations of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo yet only JPMorgan reported gifts to the charity to the Senate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA spokesman for JPMorgan, Howard Opinsky, said that the gifts were reported out of an abundance of caution. &ldquo;The rules are somewhat murkier for lawmakers without direct involvement with a foundation,&rdquo; he added.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Banks&rsquo; charitable arms</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEven in cases where lawmakers serve on nonprofits&rsquo; boards of directors, some donations are kept off the lobbyist contribution reports.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSuch gifts include a $25,000 gift in 2009 from the Bank of America Foundation to a charity called Communities in Schools of Jacksonville, where Rep. Corrine Brown sits on the board of directors, according to the foundation&rsquo;s most recently available tax forms. Another example is last year&rsquo;s $12,000 gift from the Wells Fargo Foundation to <a href=\"http://www.snapwa.org/sites/default/files/Final%20with%20Board%20for%20web.pdf\">Spokane Neighborhood Action Partners</a>, a donation confirmed by a bank spokeswoman. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., is a member of the board of directors, although she <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/personal-financial-non-disclosure/\">appointed an aide</a> to be an alternate on the board.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKappel recommended expanding the law to include gifts from companies&rsquo; charitable arms. &ldquo;The law wasn&rsquo;t written broadly enough to cover that,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;If companies control a PAC, reporting is required&hellip;They should do the same thing for other organizations controlled by an entity that lobbies or retains lobbyists,&quot; Kappel said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNicole Nactacie, a spokeswoman for Bank of America, said there is a wall between the foundation and the bank.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;&ldquo;The Bank of America charitable foundation is a 501(c)3 private foundation and is not controlled by and is not a subsidiary of Bank of America. Therefore, charitable activities are not required to be disclosed on Bank of America&rsquo;s LD-203 filings,&rdquo; she said. A spokeswoman for the Wells Fargo Foundation, Melissa Murray, made a similar statement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBoth charities, where Brown and McMorris Rodgers are board members, also received donations from the JPMorgan Chase Foundation last year, according to the lobbyist reports.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Charity connected to Orrin Hatch</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSen. Hatch helped start the Utah Families Foundation and continues to be the main draw behind the annual golf tournament that brings in all of the charity&rsquo;s funds. The <a href=\"http://utfam.net/\">agenda</a> to this summer&rsquo;s tournament at a Utah resort includes a private reception with Sen. Hatch for sponsors who contribute over $20,000.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYet, the vast majority of donors to the nonprofit, which provides grants to charities helping women and children in need, are not reported. The charity&rsquo;s revenue was nearly $900,000 in 2009.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLast year, only seven lobbying entities reported donations&mdash;totaling about $50,000&mdash;to the Utah charity, including money from medical device makers Baxter Healthcare and Boston Scientific. Utah&rsquo;s senior senator has been kind to that industry, twice introducing amendments to exempt it from a tax included in 2010&rsquo;s health care reform legislation. First, during the bill&#39;s markup in the Senate Finance Committee, Hatch offered a series of amendments to limit the tax on device makers. Later, in the final bill, <a href=\"http://cnsnews.com/node/63358\">his failed amendment</a> tried to exempt companies from the tax if the device were used by the military&rsquo;s Tricare program.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen tax forms were accidentally released in 2009, it was reported by the <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/mar/02/the-fog-of-congressional-transparency/\">Washington Times</a> that the charity received over $170,000 in donations from the pharmaceutical industry in 2007.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEven though Hatch does not have an official role with the charity, companies still donate to influence him, Kappel said. &quot;They know that he is at least informally associated with it and they want to suck up to him. That&rsquo;s the whole point of having these organizations,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe nonprofit&rsquo;s director, Sheri Sorenson, said Hatch &ldquo;has nothing to do with [the charity]. There&rsquo;s no decision-making on his part.&rdquo; She added that sometimes other lawmakers attend the annual three-day golf event. A spokeswoman for Hatch said that he &quot;does not benefit in any way from this event.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Noncompliance still a problem</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere were also donations that, by all appearances, should have been made known but were not.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOshkosh Corp., a maker of military vehicles, and the <a href=\"http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/defense_ethics/resource_library/dod_top_100_fy2010.pdf\">sixth biggest recipient</a> of Pentagon contracts last year, paid at least $100,000 to become a presenting sponsor at last year&rsquo;s&nbsp;Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.taps.org/friends/gala.aspx\">annual gala</a>&nbsp;honoring then-House Armed Services chairman Ike Skelton, D-Mo.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough the three other presenting sponsors disclosed the gift, Oshkosh did not. Company spokesman John Daggett wrote in an email that he was trying to ascertain whether the report was required. &ldquo;If it should be filed as a report, then we will purse that avenue,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOther companies may have broken the rules by not reporting donations to the Congressional Award Foundation, a charity founded by an act of Congress that gives achievement awards to youth. Four members of Congress, including Sens. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., and Max Baucus, D-Mont., sit on the foundation&rsquo;s board.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe foundation lists <a href=\"http://www.congressionalaward.org/sponsors/contributors.php\">over one hundred</a> corporate donors on its web site yet only a select few companies reported gifts to the foundation to the Senate during the past two years.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne of those annual contributors, General Dynamics&mdash;the fourth biggest recipient of Pentagon contracts last year&mdash;said reporting the donation to the Senate is not required because the foundation is not a political organization. Company&nbsp;spokesman Rob Doolittle said, &ldquo;I can tell you that if it was required to report the contributions in the lobbying reports than we would do so. But it&rsquo;s my understanding that this is a nonprofit educational foundation and it doesn&rsquo;t meet the criteria for disclosure in those reports.&quot;</p>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\r\n<p>\r\n\tBrett Kappel, the lawyer at Arent Fox, said he would have advised these companies to disclose a donation to the CAF. If there are members of Congress who vote on the board of directors of an organization, then they have sufficient control of it, he said. Compliance with the statute&nbsp;is still a problem, Kappel added, although a much smaller one than it once was.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to Gold, the main problem with the Lobbying Disclosure Act is that there is no federal agency to provide formal guidance and enforce the rules.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;The guidance is helpful but it&rsquo;s a poor substitute for an agency that could actually issue advisory opinions,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;It would be helpful if there was some kind of mechanism for the secretary of the Senate and the House clerk to give written guidance to questions coming in,&rdquo; Gold said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a limit to how much they can tell you because it&rsquo;s guess work on their part, Gold said, adding that, &ldquo;Ultimately it&rsquo;s enforced by the U.S. Attorney [for D.C.] which doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to enforce it anyway.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia focuses on lobbyists who have potentially violated the law by filling out disclosure reports improperly, according to an <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11452.pdf\">April report</a> by the Government Accountability Office.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the audit, as of January, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office had sent nearly 1,000 letters of noncompliance for 2008 lobbyist contribution reports. More than half of the cases are still pending because the lobbyist has not responded while in nearly 40 percent of the cases the lobbyists were now considered compliant.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office has not pursued any cases against lobbyists since the disclosure laws came into effect in 2008 but, as of January, was considering enforcement action against two lobbyists, the audit said.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-07-12 08:27:56", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "some-lobbyists-gifts-lawmakers-pet-causes-remain-dark", "tags": "Patty Murray, Orrin Hatch, Oshkosh, nonprofits, LD203, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Lawmakers' charities", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2377, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-07-12 08:18:20", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 25, "timestamp": "2011-06-16 12:38:17", "image": "", "title": "Graphic: Lobbyists' Honorary Gifts to Federal Officials", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tCompanies and organizations can donate an unlimited amount of money to honor officials, sponsor their conferences, and donate to their pet charities, so long as these donations are reported to the Senate.

Such a scenario is untenable and would serve neither the statute nor the regulated community.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;In our view,&quot; they continued, &quot;Revised Draft A appears to present a viable opportunity for consensus among the commissioners.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBopp&#39;s firm also submitted a <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/docs/?id=213175-republican-super-pac-comment-on-draft-advisory\">comment on the draft advisory opinions</a>. &quot;Draft B, or an AO reaching the same conclusions on the same rationale, is the AO that the Commission should issue,&quot; they wrote. &quot;But if the FEC thinks that the law requires a disclaimer such as Senators Reid and Kerry employed, then the Commissioners should issue such an AO.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlso Thursday, the FEC approved a media exemption <a href=\"http://saos.nictusa.com/aodocs/1175210.pdf\">requested by comedian Stephen Colbert</a> for his proposed Super PAC. At issue was whether any costs incurred by Viacom, Comedy Central&#39;s parent company, related to Colbert Super PAC would have to be reported to the FEC.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe commissioners voted unanimously to approve portions of <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/docs/?id=207711-draft-advisory-opinions-stephen-colbert\">draft Advisory Opinion A</a>, then voted 5-1 to approve <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/docs/?id=213153-amendment-to-draft-a-stephen-colbert\">amendments to the draft</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tColbert spoke briefly in response to a question about the PAC&#39;s advertising plans. &quot;We don&#39;t know what we&#39;d do with the ads because we don&#39;t have the PAC yet,&quot; Colbert said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe commission&#39;s staff set up an overflow room to hold the larger-than-normal crowd at the meeting.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-06-30 11:26:44", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "fec-allows-candidates-solicit-limited-contributions-super-pacs", "tags": "Independent Expenditures, FEC, campaign finance, super pacs, james bopp jr.", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2395, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-06-29 15:01:39", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 25, "timestamp": "2011-06-29 11:10:25", "image": "", "title": "Natural gas proponents powered by industry donations", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tAn investigation by the <em>New York Times</em> this week raised questions about whether the natural gas industry has had too much influence on policymaking by federal agencies, and whether that sway has led investors, members of Congress and others to be overly bullish about the energy source.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/us/27gas.html\">article</a>&nbsp;focused on the Energy Information Agency, the research arm of the Department of Energy, which writes annual reports on the industry that are considered authoritative. Ian Urbina wrote that, in its reports, the EIA has:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t[S]teadily increased its estimates of domestic supplies of natural gas, and investors and the oil and gas industry have repeated them widely to make their case about a prosperous future.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn response to the article, four members of Congress <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/us/politics/29naturalgas.html\">wrote</a> to the EIA yesterday asking whether the office&rsquo;s procedures amounted to a conflict of interest and why agency scientists&rsquo; doubts about shale gas had not been heeded.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Times quoted leaked emails showing senior EIA officials concerned with the &lsquo;euphoria&rsquo; surrounding the shale gas boom. At least one <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/us/natural-gas-drilling-down-documents-4.html#document/p32/a21580\">senior scientist wrote</a> that the EIA relied too heavily on outside contractors using &ldquo;incomplete/selective&rdquo; data. The contractors, some of who have natural gas clients, supply shale gas estimates for the agency&rsquo;s annual reports, Urbina wrote.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEIA&rsquo;s reports not only inform investors but also legislators, Urbina noted. Rep. John Sullivan, R-Okla., a favorite of the gas industry, authored the New Alternative Transportation to Give Americans Solutions Act in April, which provides tax credits for vehicles fueled by natural gas. The bill has garnered over 180 co-sponsors.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSullivan has touted natural gas as a savior from energy dependence. &ldquo;We have over 120-year reserves of natural gas&hellip;it is absolutely asinine not to use that,&quot; he said <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/42455418/Sullivan_Not_Using_US_Nat_Gas_Is_Absolutely_Asinine\">on cable TV</a> in April.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSullivan and the bill&rsquo;s lead Democratic co-sponsor Dan Boren, D-Okla., are two of the three members of Congress who received the most campaign donations from the natural gas pipeline industry for the 2010 election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. As a whole, the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=E01&amp;cycle=2010&amp;recipdetail=H&amp;mem=N\">oil and gas industry</a> gave more to Boren&mdash;about $225,000&mdash;than all but two House colleagues for the election. Sullivan was not too far behind.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe bill&rsquo;s early success may speak to the power of the energy lobby pushing for government intervention in the natural gas market. At least 23 companies have disclosed lobbying on the bill this year, according to a <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/billsum.php?id=124666\">search for H.R. 1380</a> on Opensecrets.org. There are likely many more companies lobbying on the bill but not listing its number on their disclosure forms. For instance, natural gas company Chesapeake Energy reported lobbying on &ldquo;natural gas vehicles.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut some companies, led by the oil refining conglomerate owned by the politically influential Koch brothers, have campaigned against the legislation, according to <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/677-e2-wire/167075-sullivan-defends-natural-gas-bill-says-critics-doing-kochs-bidding\">a report</a> in The Hill newspaper. Their efforts have resulted in 14 members of Congress withdrawing their support for the bill.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt was another natural gas industry campaign&mdash;this one under the Bush Administration&mdash;that allowed the industry to increase their estimates of shale oil reserves and thereby please investors, Urbina <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/us/27gasside.html?pagewanted=all\">reported</a>. The S.E.C. adjusted the way it allowed companies to count their shale gas reserves in 2008, permitting them to include previously uncountable reserves that are harder to obtain.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne of the companies that pushed for that rule change is natural gas champion Chesapeake Energy. Election after election, Sullivan and Boren are among the biggest recipients of campaign donations from that company&rsquo;s political action committee.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn total, Chesapeake Energy&rsquo;s executives and PAC have given over $40,000 to each Oklahoma congressman over the past decade, according to the CRP.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-06-29 12:45:32", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "natural-gas-proponents-powered-industry-donations", "tags": "Dan Boren, John Sullivan, Energy Information Agency, S.E.C., NAT GAS Act, natural gas", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2385, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-08-18 17:04:27", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 4, "timestamp": "2011-06-23 11:57:07", "image": "", "title": "One out of ten investment advisers disciplined", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tThroughout his career as a broker-dealer, Anthony Gerard Manaia has been fired twice. He&rsquo;s been the subject of 18 complaints by disgruntled investors, most of whom accused him of putting their money in risky investments without their knowledge. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s currently under investigation for his role in a scandal around offerings by a medical financing company that a federal agency has accused of misappropriating investor funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn July 2010 Manaia gave up his broker-dealer registration. Five months later, in January 2011, he hung out his shingle as an investment adviser. His <a href=\"http://www.manaiacmi.com/\">website</a> targets &ldquo;high net worth individuals&rdquo; and says the firm will build a &ldquo;professionally managed, diversified investment portfolio,&rdquo; and that clients will be interviewed to determine their tolerance for risk.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis information about Manaia&rsquo;s record is publicly available, as are the complaints, fees, enforcement actions and other disciplinary actions associated with 11,000-plus registered investment adviser firms and 5,100 broker dealer firms in this country. Anybody can look up the records&mdash;although you need to know where and how to look. See accompanying <a href=\"http:// http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/good-investor-data-are-hard-find/\">story</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn analysis of available data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on investment advisers shows that more than one out of ten registered investment adviser firms have reported that they have been the subject of some sort of disciplinary action, including 39 with employees who have been convicted of a felony; 722 that have been involved in a violation of investment-related regulations or statutes; and 614 that have been subject to an order by a regulatory federal, state, or foreign regulatory agency.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese disciplinary actions can range from slaps on the wrist for failure to file paperwork on time to multi-million dollar judgments related to major financial scandals, such as the Enron fiasco. There are advisers who have been convicted on child pornography <a href=\"http://www.mass.gov/obcbbo/bd06-085-2.htm\">charges</a> and shoplifting and many others, like Manaia, whose record shows no official criminal offense but still might give pause to an investor. And there is a vast difference between the way these advisers&mdash;who are trying to encourage trust and have a certain wealth conjuring mystique&mdash;present themselves to the world through their websites and brochures they are required to give to customers as opposed to the information that is buried in SEC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) files.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile there is much overlap between investment advisers and broker-dealers&mdash;an individual can be registered as both--they are overseen by different entities. Investment advisers are professionals who manage money for their clients, whether they are individuals with a small retirement account or major metropolises managing public pension funds. Legally they are supposed to serve in the best interest of their clients, a concept known as &ldquo;fiduciary duty,&rdquo; and the larger ones are overseen by the SEC. Broker dealers, on the other hand, are generally not subject to fiduciary duty and are largely overseen by FINRA, a &ldquo;self regulatory organization,&rdquo; or SRO.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFurthermore, just like the story about the drunk looking for his keys under the street lamp because that&rsquo;s where the light is best, information about disciplinary actions takes the investor only so far. Bernie Madoff is a case in point: registered both as an investment adviser and a broker dealer, before his massive Ponzi scheme was exposed his public record revealed <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/2008/12/the-moral-hazard-of-sec-registration\">little</a> that would give a potential customer particular cause for worry.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2011/913studyfinal.pdf\">study</a> mandated by the law The Dodd-Frank law studied the regulatory regime for investment advisers and broker-dealers to determine, among other things, whether ordinary people understand the difference. One of the study&rsquo;s conclusions was that broker-dealers should be subject to the same &ldquo;fiduciary standard&rdquo; as investment advisers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, the last several years, the number of investment advisers have increased rapidly, even as the SEC has had fewer resources to dedicate to examinations. According to a <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2011/914studyfinal.pdf\">report</a> mandated by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, from 2004 to 2010, the number of investment firms grew from 8,581 to 11,888, and the amount of money they managed grew from $24.1 trillion to $38.3 trillion. At the same time, the number of examinations decreased nearly 30 percent, from 1,543 in 2004 to 1,083 in 2010. The report recommends Congress consider charging investment advisers user fees to cover examination costs or giving more authority to FINRA to oversee investment advisers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut none of these speak to a case like that of Manaia, who appears to be staying in business by floating between the two regulatory realms. In the mid-1990s, after the Los Angeles Times published a series of <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-22/business/fi-2404_1_leading-firms/2\">stories</a> about scandals in the way big broker-dealer firms operated, the SEC <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/rogue.txt\">noted</a> that individuals with serious histories of consumer complaints nevertheless were moving from firm to firm. The SEC and FINRA would not comment on his individual case, and Manaia did not return calls for comment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCloseups<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Who: </strong>Manaia Capital Management Inc.<br />\r\n\t<strong>What the <a href=\"http://www.manaiacmi.com/Our-Firm.1.htm\">website</a> says: </strong>&ldquo;Manaia Capital Management&nbsp;helps individuals and companies build&nbsp;professionally managed, diversified investment portfolio, [sic] customized to meet their specific objectives.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<strong>What the record says:</strong><br />\r\n\tManaia is currently under investigation by FINRA for allegations of violations related to MedCap holdings. In July 2009, the SEC <a href=\"http://www.medicalcapitalreceivership.com/images/ComplaintFiled.pdf\">obtained</a> a preliminary injunction to stop MedCap, a California-based medical receivables financing company, from making any more sales offerings. The SEC alleged that the company had misappropriated $18.5 million in investor funds. In April, FINRA <a href=\"http://www.finra.org/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2011/P123441\">announced</a> that it had sanctioned two firms and seven individuals for their selling private offerings of MedCap without &ldquo;conducting a reasonable investigation,&rdquo; and that it was continuing to investigate other broker dealers.<br />\r\n\tManaia has been fired twice from jobs as a broker-dealer, once more nearly 20 years ago from a job at Merrill Lynch and more recently, in July 2010, from Intervest International Equities Corporation, for &ldquo;multiple violation of firm&#39;s policies and procedures&rdquo;. Both times he states he quit before he was fired.<br />\r\n\tHe has been the subject of 18 customer disputes and has paid out nearly $1.8 million to settle 16 of them. Most allege that the put customers&rsquo; money in risky investments without their agreement. Manaia contends that the clients in question had an appetite for risk.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manaia did not return calls for comment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Who:</strong> Sandell Asset Management Corporation<br />\r\n\t<strong>What the <a href=\"http://www.sandellmgmt.com/aboutSandell.asp\">website</a> says: &ldquo;</strong>We are committed to integrity, unwavering ethics, forthrightness and fair dealing in all that we do. We understand this, above all else, is the lifeblood of our success.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<strong>What the <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2007/2007-216.htm\">record</a> says:</strong> &quot;By mismarking certain trades and falsely claiming that firm personnel had located stock to borrow, Sandell Asset Management gained an unfair trading advantage over other market participants.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<strong>Penalties: </strong>Firm paid more than $8 million to settle the charges; top executives made civil payments totaling $190,000.<br />\r\n\t<strong>What happened:</strong> According to the SEC <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2007/33-8857.pdf\">order</a>, In August 2005, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the hedge fund&rsquo;s executives were worried that they would lose money on their bet on the Hibernia, a New Orleans-based financial holding company. Hibernia was in the process of being acquired by Capital One Financial Corporation. Thomas E. Sandell and his colleagues were concerned that Capital One would lower its offering price for the company. Sandell had already leveraged its interest in Hibernia through swaps, so it didn&rsquo;t actually own any of the company&rsquo;s stocks, although it bore financial risk if the price fell. Sandell and another executive instructed an employee to make &ldquo;short&rdquo; sales&mdash;where a seller borrows the stock in question&mdash;but label them as &ldquo;long&rdquo; sales, thereby sidestepping SEC rules then in effect that would have disallowed these transactions. After receiving legal advice that what they were doing was against the rules, Sandell continued to encourage his staff to make short sales of Hibernia, even though they had told him they were having trouble locating enough stock to cover the sales. The firm did not return request for comment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Who: </strong>Aletheia Research and Management, Inc.<br />\r\n\t<strong>What the <a href=\"http://www.aletheiaresearch.com/about\">website</a> says:</strong> &ldquo;Aletheia is the classical Greek word for &ldquo;truth and disclosure,&rdquo; of bringing facts into the open. Aletheia is an independent, registered investment advisor dedicated to uncovering investment truth.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<strong>What the <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2011/34-64442.pdf\">record</a> says: </strong>&ldquo;From 2006 to 2008, Aletheia disseminated proposals to client [sic.] and potential clients that failed to disclose requested information regarding prior Commission examinations&hellip;&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<strong>Penalties: </strong>The firm and two executives were censured and required to pay total of $400,000 in civil fines<br />\r\n\t<strong>What happened: </strong>As of late 2009, Alethia managed more than $7.1 billion in assets for 5,400 clients, which included retail accounts, institutions, and two private hedge funds. When prospective clients sent questionnaires asking whether the SEC had ever found any problems in its examinations of the firm, the firm dissembled, either saying there were no such findings or sending misleading information. In fact, the SEC had conducted an exam in 2005 in which it had found six deficiencies, which the firm should have reported. The firm was also late to make quarterly statements to its limited partners, as required by law. AND firm failed to keep records showing that it had provided employees with its code of ethics even after it was warned it must do so.<br />\r\n\t<strong>What Alethia says:</strong> &ldquo;Alethia is gratified with the way the SEC settlement worked out,&rdquo; says a spokesman for the firm, Robert Siegfried.&nbsp; &ldquo;It views the settlement and order as making very clear how the issues were directly related to the oversight of [Roger] Peikin, a former employee.&rdquo; In&nbsp; late 2010, Peikin, a co-founder of the firm, sued the company for wrongful termination. In the lawsuit, he alleged that he clashed with Peter J. Eichler Jr, the firm&rsquo;s other co-founder, over &ldquo;trading practices, general disregard for regulatory controls, wanton expenditure of corporate assets for Eichler&rsquo;s personal benefit, and overall neglect of the business side of Aletheia&rsquo;s operations.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Who:</strong> Scarborough Capital Management<br />\r\n\t<strong>What the</strong><strong> <a href=\"http://redirect.advisorsquare.com/new/401kadvice/\">website</a> says:</strong> &ldquo;Some would call us a boutique wealth management firm, but our desire is to help every client achieve their own definition of financial well-being.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<strong>What the <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8438.htm\">record</a> says: </strong>&ldquo;From 1998 through early 2000, [Mike] Scarborough&hellip;sold brokerage customers Class B mutual fund shares in amounts that would have entitled them to &ldquo;breakpoint&rdquo; discounts had they purchased Class A shares of the same funds&hellip;Scarborough&hellip;did not tell them that Class A shares generally produce higher returns than Class B shares of the same mutual fund when purchased in amounts of $100,000 or more.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<strong>Penalties:</strong> Royal Alliance was censured and fined $150,000; Scarborough was suspended from supervising any broker or dealer for nine months. In addition, Scarborough was required to pay &ldquo;disgorgement&rdquo; of $2.11 million and a monetary penalty of $50,000. Royal Alliance loaned Scarborough $2 million to help pay the fines. Scarborough later got his repayment amount reduced but still owes Royal Alliance $215,000, which must be repaid by January 2012.<br />\r\n\t<strong>What happened: </strong>Mike Scarborough is quoted widely in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/business/economy/05fund.html?scp=1&amp;sq=%22mike%20scarborough%22&amp;st=cse\">media</a> as an expert on 401(k) plans, has written a <a href=\"http://www.bookdoctor.com/corinthian/scarborough/scarboroughplan.html\">book</a> for investors on maximizing investments, and is registered both as an investment adviser and a broker dealer. He formerly worked for a firm called Royal Alliance. The SEC <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8438.htm\">charged</a> that Scarborough directed employees there to sell Class B mutual fund shares to clients even though some investers&mdash;those with $100,000 or more&mdash;would benefit more from Class A mutual fund shares. This practice brought in more commissions for the firm. They were aggressive in marketing the Class B shares, for example giving customers a brochure that said that purchasing them &ldquo;alleviates upfront commissions normally charged to you. Instead, our compensation comes to us directly from the mutual fund companies for the ongoing management of your assets. Such an arrangement works well for clients with a long-term investment horizon and a need to balance both growth and income.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<strong>What Scarborough says: </strong>&ldquo;If any governmental agency decides they want to go after somebody they have much deeper pockets than you do and they can do what they want to you,&rdquo; says Scarborough, who contends he was treated unfairly by the SEC. Scarborough says agency staff told his lawyer they were making an example of him on the issue of Class B shares, and that they wouldn&rsquo;t go after larger firms over the same type of practice because they had more resources to fight it. He also says that he lost only &ldquo;one out of 4,000 clients&rdquo; over the issue and has no problem explaining his history to current clients.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n\tDisciplinary Actions Reported by Invester Adviser Firms</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHover the cursor over the bars for more information.<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"700\" scrolling=\"NO\" src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/reporting/disciplinary_actions.html\" width=\"580\">&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;

While the information on broker-dealers and investment advisers is all a matter of public record, you need a degree in government webology to find it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website includes a search page where anybody can look up an investment adviser firm or an an investment adviser representative, <a href=\"http://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov/%28S%28wwum4bfzqsffulclggdzgp2r%29%29/IAPD/Content/Search/iapd_Search.aspx\">here</a>. At present, any firm with assets of more than $25 million must register here. But as of July 21, the anniversary of the passage of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, only advisers managing $100 million or more will <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2011/2011-133.htm\">register</a> with the Commission. If they are smaller, they register with the state.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo find the disciplinary actions against a firm you need to know where to look&mdash;the terminology is &ldquo;Part 1A Item 11 Disclosure Information DRPs.&rdquo; But even when you click here you may not get all the available information about a particular firm or individual. That&rsquo;s because if the information is reported elsewhere, the firm need only indicate that fact.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou have to go over to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self regulating organization (SRO), which maintains <a href=\"http://www.finra.org/Investors/ToolsCalculators/BrokerCheck/\">BrokerCheck</a>. Here it&rsquo;s possible to look up a broker-dealer firm or an individual broker-dealer. The search mechanism returns a PDF which you can read through to find the disciplinary information. FINRA also maintains several other public databases on its website where you can get additional information.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInvestor advisers are also required to deliver printed brochures directly to clients that contains basic information about their businesses, including disciplinary actions. But of course it is difficult to know whether this requirement is followed in all instances--and the descriptions in these brochures do not go into as much detail as what is available through the websites.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt is nearly impossible to do a comprehensive analysis of invester adviser and broker-dealer data because of the way that the SEC and FINRA make them available. Much of the information is locked behind proprietary interfaces and generated on PDFs that make it difficult to manipulate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause FINRA is not a government agency, it is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). While both the SEC and FINRA publish regular summaries of their enforcement actions <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin.shtml\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.finra.org/Industry/Enforcement/DisciplinaryActions/MonthlyActions/2011/\">here</a>, it is not simple to take these to determine, for example, which major firm has racked up the most violations over the past several years.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFurthermore, FINRA is the contractor that maintains all of the data&mdash;including the investment adviser data&mdash;for the SEC. While the SEC makes a portion of its invester adviser data available <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/foia/docs/invafoia.htm\">here</a> in a spreadsheet format, according to SEC staff additional details must be purchased from FINRA&mdash;the full data file available costs $1,680. And even that doesn&#39;t include all the information.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCongress recognized that there was a problem when it passed the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. The law mandated that the SEC study how to make investor data more easily accessible and that it implement changes within 18 months after the <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2011/919bstudy.pdf\">study</a> was delivered, in January.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAmong the options considered by the agency in its study was consolidating invester-adviser and broker-dealer into one database. But that would be impossible to implement within the 18-month deadline, said the agency, so instead it proposed some stopgap measures-creating a search mechanism that would return results from both databases, for example, and creating a means where a user could search by zip code.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe report also recommends that more research be done to determine what changes should be made in the long term. But no where does it discuss the idea of making the underlying data available to the public in electronic format, so that journalists, developers, businesses, and members of the public can obtain it to do their own analyses.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInto this void a for-profit company has entered. <a href=\"http://www.brightscope.com\">Brightscope</a>, a website that got its start rating company 401(k) plans, in April started to provide a one-stop <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-26/brightscope-aims-to-beat-sec-finra-showing-adviser-disciplinary-actions.htm\">search</a> based on SEC and FINRA data where you can look up both invester advisers and broker-dealers. The firm has developed a rating system that reflects disciplinary records.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, according to a company spokesman, the firm had to use &ldquo;technological means,&rdquo; to wrest the data from the two sites. He said that the company is in &ldquo;discussions&rdquo; with FINRA about a rule change that &ldquo;would make the data more widely available to all.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMeanwhile, the Sunlight Foundation filed a FOIA today asking the SEC for the complete data set&mdash;in electronic form--underlying investment adviser filings.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>About the data</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>What: </strong>Invester adviser and broker-dealer disciplinary actions</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Where: </strong>SEC oversees invester adviser data and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self regulating organization (SRO), oversees broker-dealer data.

That draft said candidates could appear at Super PAC fundraisers but could not solicit unlimited contributions.

($5,000 is the current calendar-year limit for individual contributions to any political action committee.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the past week, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada and Rep.

Both legislators are limiting their solicitations to $5,000 per contributor.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/docs/?id=211414-draft-advisory-opinion-b-majority-pac-and-house\">The other draft Advisory Opinion</a> goes much further. It would allow candidates to solicit unlimited contributions for Super PACs from individuals, corporations and labor unions.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe two drafts give differing views of the same federal statute that governs campaign finance law. Both include the following line:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tFederal officeholders and candidates, their agents, and entities directly or indirectly established, financed, or maintained, or controlled by, or acting on behalf of, Federal officeholders and candidates, may not raise or spend funds in connection with an election for Federal office, &quot;unless the funds are subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements of the Act.&quot; 2 U.S.C. 441i(e)(1)(A); 11 CFR 300.61</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, while the first draft interprets the statute as barring federal candidates and party officers from soliciting unlimited contributions for Super PACs (because such money would not be &quot;subject to the limitations&quot; of the law), the second draft says such contributions <i>are</i> in fact subject to those limitations and should be considered &quot;Federal funds,&quot; just like any other money contributed to candidates and political committees &mdash; as opposed to &quot;soft money,&quot; which candidates and party officers can&#39;t solicit.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe draft Advisory Opinions are a response to <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/docs/?id=96351-house-majority-pac-majority-pac-advisory-opinion.html\">a request</a> by Majority PAC (formerly called Commonsense Ten), which aims to help elect Democrats to the Senate, and a counterpart for House races, House Majority PAC. Their request was made after <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/outside-spending/letters/C00496349\">Republican Super PAC</a>, led by campaign finance lawyer James Bopp Jr., registered with the FEC and <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/docs/?id=94040-republican-super-pac\">stated its plans</a> to have candidates and party officers solicit unlimited contributions for it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn a <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/docs/?id=97136-comment-by-republican-super-pac-on-advisory.html\">comment on the Advisory Opinion request</a>, Bopp defended the plans of all three groups, saying contributions solicited for a Super PAC should be considered &quot;federal funds.&quot; He echoed that opinion <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2011/06/money-talks-james-bopp.html\">in an interview this week with OpenSecrets</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>OpenSecrets Blog:</strong> What is the distinction for you between soft money and hard money?</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>Bopp:</strong> I prefer the phrase federal and non-federal, and that is of course what is applicable under federal law. Candidates cannot raise non-federal funds. They can raise federal funds. Federal funds are just what is regulated under the Federal Elections Act. Super PACs are federal political action committees, so they would be subject to federal law.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwo former Senators, Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., and Warren Rudman, R-N.H., <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/docs/?id=118188-comment-by-former-sens-kerrey-rudman-on-super\">took a different view</a>, saying such solicitations are not permissible under the <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/press/bkgnd/bcra_overview.shtml\">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSuper PACs, or independent-expenditure-only committees, were created as a result of <a href=\"http://docs.justia.com/cases/supreme/slip/558/08-205/opinion.pdf\">Citizens United v.

They&#39;ve managed to enlist a majority of House members and 44 Senators in their cause.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMany of the trade associations in the coalition are from the real estate, mortgage banking and home building industries, all of which have been big campaign contributors to many of the members of Congress leading the charge for slighter regulation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe rule stems from a provision in last year&rsquo;s Dodd-Frank Wall Street overhaul bill, and requires that mortgage sellers <a href=\"http://www.housingwire.com/2011/03/29/fdic-votes-for-20-down-on-qrm\">keep five percent</a> of the loan&rsquo;s value on their books unless it meets standards for soundness--called a qualified residential mortgage, or QRM. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which regulates commercial banks, was left to define QRMs, and determined that only loans in which borrowers put down 20 percent down payments would qualify.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThree senators&mdash;Sens. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., Mary Landrieu, D-La., and Kay Hagan, D-N.C.&mdash;authored the section of the law that exempted QRMs, but left it to the FDIC to define them. The new rules make qualifying for that exception far too difficult, the three senators, along with two House members, <a href=\"http://isakson.senate.gov/press/2011/062211QRM.html\">have said</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn his career, Isakson, a former real estate executive, has received more campaign contributions from that sector than all but four sitting senators: over $2.3 million from political action committees and real estate employees, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. His campaign has raked in more from home builders&mdash;over $250,000&mdash;than all but one Senate colleague.&nbsp; One of the coalition groups is the National Association of Home Builders.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLandrieu, meanwhile, tapped the real estate sector for nearly $450,000 in the past six-year period, more than she got from every other industry except lawyers and law firms, according to the CRP. Hagan has relied less on the sector.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe two House members leading the charge, Reps. Brad Sherman D-Calif., and John Campbell, R-Calif., both on the Financial Services Committee, each received about $120,000 from the real estate industry for their 2010 re-election race, more than double the average received from that sector by their colleagues, according to the CRP.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne corner of the real estate industry&mdash;mortgage bankers and brokers&mdash;is the key constituency lobbying against the rule. Mortgage industry PACs and employees have contributed more to Sherman&mdash;about $140,000&mdash;in his career than to all but five of his House colleagues, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFurther, two of his former staffers are now lobbying for the Mortgage Bankers Association, which has opposed the new rules since they were released but has not joined the coalition. The MBA had the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/indusclient.php?id=F10&amp;year=a\">fourth biggest</a> lobbying budget in the real estate industry last year.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe MBA&rsquo;s legislative affairs director Brad Cheney was the California&rsquo;s congressman&rsquo;s chief of staff from 2008 to 2009. Gary L. Goldberg, Sherman&rsquo;s one-time legislative director, lobbies for the industry group on <a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=2B68D6CA-0AB7-4F33-8918-78445F5C919D\">Dodd-Frank implementation</a>. Goldberg also lobbies for two other coalition members on the same issue: the Independent Community Bankers of America and the National Association of Home Builders.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe coalition&rsquo;s lobbying and advocacy push has brought more and more members of Congress to its side. At the end of May, there were about <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/01/us-usa-housing-mortgages-idUSTRE7426B020110601\">200 members of Congress</a>&nbsp;who signed on to letters opposing the new risk retention rules.

After the late May letters, regulators <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/regulators-push-back-deadline-on-risk-retention-rules/\">pushed back</a> the comment period for the new rules to August.

According to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R40764.pdf\">a new report by the Congressional Research Service</a>&nbsp;(CRS), Congress&#39; nonpartisan research group, as of March 2011, there were about 98,800 uniformed troops in Afghanistan and about 90,339 contracted employees. As recently as December 2008, contractors made up&nbsp;69 percent of the combined uniformed/non-uniformed personnel in Afghanistan. About half of the contracted employees in Afghanistan are local nationals.&nbsp;CRS used contractor census reports to come to that conclusion, however, this data has been criticized for its inaccuracies, particularly when it comes to counting the number of Afghan nationals serving the Department of Defense. The Commission on Wartime Contracting discussed these problems at length during a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wartimecontracting.gov/index.php/hearings/commission/hearing20001102\">2009 hearing</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tOther problems existing with defense contracts include payments made to Afghan warlords, according to a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/33430036/Warlords-Inc-Report-A-Congressional-Report\">2010 House investigative report</a>. A 2010 Governmental Accountability Office&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-509T\">report&nbsp;</a>also pointed out a general lack of oversight when it comes to tracking who receives military contracts.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tAccording to the CRS report, some reforms to military contracting have been made, including creating a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dcma.mil/communicator/summer06/3_customer_focus/DCMA_Comm_v06n03_pp24-pp29.pdf\">Joint Contracting Command</a>&nbsp;group designed to improve military communication and a plan to increase management training for those who oversee contract workers. According to CRS, the Department of Defense is working on creating an online course for military higher-ups to take prior to deployment to help them work better with contractors.&nbsp;Obama promised to reform the military contract system and to create transparency standards for military contractors, but such legislation is still pending.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tAnother promise the president made &mdash; to clarify the legal status for contracted defense workers so that they may be disciplined for misconduct &mdash; has stalled, according to the fact-checking website&nbsp;<a href=\"http://politifact.com/\">Politifact.com</a>. The&nbsp;Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Enforcement Act to accomplish this goal made it through the House in 2007 but not through the Senate.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe President&#39;s decision could have domestic repercussions as well. Large defense contractors, for example, could be affected by the emerging future plan in Afghanistan. These organizations tend to have a great deal of lobbying clout and their political action committees, employees and their family makers are prolific donors to federal campaigns.&nbsp;Earlier this month, we highlighted the Pentagon&#39;s release of its&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/taxonomy/term/Defense-Contracts/\">top 100 department of defense contractors</a>, which includes&nbsp;deals with Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman &mdash; all of which had spent millions of dollars in campaign contributions and tens of millions on lobbying during the 2009-2010 election cycle.&nbsp;For example, Lockheed Martin, who manufactures high tech military equipment including jets and missiles, gave $2.3 million to members of Congress in 2010, according to <a href=\"http://opensecrets.org\">OpenSecrets.org</a>. Top donations included $52,000 to Rep. Howard McKeon, R-Calif. and $48,500 to Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. McKeon is chair of the House Committee on Armed Services, and Schumer is on the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security for the Senate Judiciary Committee. The airplane manufacturer Boeing gave $2.4 million to lawmakers in 2010. Boeing&#39;s top donations included $85,860 to Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and $32,900 to Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan.

Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., best known now for trading in his role as cable news brawler for comedy show punchline, was determined by his own actions and the public response to them, a small band of conservatives challenging campaign finance laws made Weiner the center of a plan that would have an enormous impact. An obscure PAC, a 23-year-old activist and canny Washington lawyers leveraged the intention to donate $6,300 into a ruling that could give political action committees license to operate Super PACs--spending unlimited sums raised from corporations or unions to influence elections--while continuing to contribute to candidates.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCourt documents, campaign finance filings with the Federal Election Commission and interviews with some of the participants in a federal court case, Carey v. FEC, show that Weiner&#39;s legacy might include his unwitting involvement in an effort to weaken rules designed to limit the influence of special interests on federal elections. They also reveal how a small number of activists and lawyers, working closely together through interlocking organizations, have chipped away at campaign finance laws.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the 2010 election cycle, PACs&nbsp;<a href=\"\">accounted</a>&nbsp;for 43 percent of the money raised by incumbent House members seeking reelection and 20 percent raised by incumbent Senators seeking another term, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Overall, PACs contributed $422.2 million to congressional candidates--all raised from individuals in increments of $5,000 per individual per year or less. Should the plaintiffs in Carey v. FEC prevail, PACs would also be able to raise unlimited sums from a few donors then spend hundreds of thousands, if not millions, influencing congressional elections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Before Carey, a SuperPAC had to be a separate entity, but now it doesn&#39;t,&quot; Bob Biersack, a special assistant at the FEC, said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPutting it more simply, Dan Backer, the attorney who brought the suit on behalf of the plaintiffs, said,&nbsp;&quot;It would turn every PAC into a super duper PAC.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYet the plaintiffs bringing about what could be a sea change in how PACs operate are hardly big players in the world of money and politics.&nbsp;In the free-wheeling 2010 mid-term election spending spree, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00359992\">National Defense PAC</a>--or NDPAC, as it&#39;s sometimes called--hardly rated a footnote: it raised less than $3,000 and contributed less than $1,500 to federal candidates, all Republican congressional candidates, all of whom lost. (NDPAC also made a contribution to Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., who won&#39;t face voters until Nov. 2012.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThroughout the 2010 election cycle, NDPAC did not receive a single contribution of more than $200, according to FEC records. But on August 11, 2010, when it had&nbsp;<a href=\"http://images.nictusa.com/pdf/640/10931411640/10931411640.pdf#navpanes=0\">less than $300</a> in its bank accounts, the PAC&nbsp;<a href=\"http://saos.nictusa.com/aodocs/1148154.pdf\">requested</a> an advisory opinion from the FEC, stating its intent to accept contributions in unlimited amounts from individuals, corporations and labor unions to use on independent expenditures. The PAC proposed to the FEC that it would maintain separate accounts for these donations so that the funds would not be mingled with donations raised to contribute to candidates, and would pay administrative and operating costs--paying for fundraising, accounting expenses and so on--from either account, but most likely wholly from its independent expenditure account.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe FEC <a href=\"http://saos.nictusa.com/aodocs/1148937.pdf\">considered</a>&nbsp;adopting a motion that would have allowed NDPAC to establish a separate, super PAC account on Sept. 23, 2010, and <a href=\"http://saos.nictusa.com/aodocs/1152298.pdf\">rejected it</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBacker said NDPAC had at least one donor who wanted to contribute more than the $5,000 maximum the PAC could legally accept. &quot;From the organizational perspective it doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to solicit those donations if you can&#39;t accept them,&quot; he added.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter the advisory opinion failed, NDPAC tried a different tack. On January 25, 2011, a conservative activist named Kelly S. Eustis, who runs a <a href=\"http://www.eusatrix.com/\">political consulting firm</a>&nbsp;and is <a href=\"http://centralny.ynn.com/content/top_stories/546734/young-activist-says-he-may-run-for-new-york-s-23rd/\">considering a run</a>&nbsp;against Rep. Bill Owens, D-N.Y.,&nbsp;wrote a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/docs/?id=205040-complaint-carey-v-fec#document/p62\">letter</a>&nbsp;to James Carey, a retired Navy admiral and chairman of NDPAC, stating his intention to &quot;support the Independent Expenditure activity of the National Defense PAC&quot; citing &quot;the importance of defeating Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York in the next election.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCarey&#39;s PAC had never given to an opponent of Weiner&#39;s, or any politician in the state of New York, for that matter. &quot;We&nbsp;looked at a long list of candidates, and picked him,&quot; Backer said, adding that &quot;for the lawsuit, they wanted to show just one example, although others were mentioned as well. It &nbsp;was sheer stupid luck that Anthony Weiner happened to get into trouble.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWeiner resigned&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\tEustis&#39; letter went on: &quot;I am only willing to contribute if my contribution will be able to have an actual impact, and if it is legal to do so under federal election law. As such, I will contribute $6,300, which is the cost you have shared with me to launch an online campaign in opposition to Congressman Weiner.&quot;</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat request--to give money in excess of the $5,000 per year individuals are permitted to donate to PACs to make an independent expenditure in a federal election--is at the heart of the Carey v. FEC lawsuit. Carey, Eustis and NDPAC sued the FEC, arguing that their free speech rights were abridged because the PAC was prohibited from taking Eustis&#39; $6,300 contribution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn its complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington on Jan. 31, 2011--just six days after Eustis wrote his letter--the plaintiffs claimed that NDPAC had&nbsp;<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/docs/?id=205040-complaint-carey-v-fec#p9\">intended</a>&nbsp;to make independent expenditures in the 2010 campaign, but &quot;was not legally permitted to solicit more than $5,000 per calendar year per person to fund independent expenditures.&quot; The complaint lists races the PAC intended to intervene in, including New York&#39;s ninth district--represented by Anthony Weiner--but &quot;was not legally permitted to solicit more than $5,000 per calendar year per person to fund independent expenditures&quot; supporting their candidates. An exhibit filed with the complaint--NDPAC&#39;s list of endorsed 2010 candidates--does not list Weiner&#39;s opponent in the 2010 election.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\twrote to the PAC expressing his intention to make a $6,300 contribution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYet Eustis&#39; intent to make that contribution launched a court case that he and his co-plaintiffs, NDPAC and its founder and chairman, James Carey, a retired Navy admiral, appear to be on the verge of winning. A federal judge has issued a <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/carey_dc_memo_opinion.pdf\">preliminary injunction</a> against the FEC, <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/carey_dc_order.pdf\">allowing</a> NDPAC to set up a separate bank account for accepting contributions in unlimited amounts for independent expenditures. Dan Backer, an attorney representing Eustis, NDPAC and Carey, said, &quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Helvetica; \">Then any political action committee, and any independent expenditure-only committee, for that matter, could operate in two ways: raising contributions in limited amounts to donate to candidates, and in unlimited amounts from individuals, corporations and labor unions to influence elections, provided they didn&#39;t coordinate with candidates. But the same PAC officials writing checks to influence candidates could also direct far greater amounts of independent expenditures to affect their races. </span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn January 25, 2011, Eustis&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the FEC&#39;s taxonomy of political organizations, the National Defense PAC is a&nbsp;<a href=\"\">non-connected political action committee</a>, meaning that it&#39;s not sponsored by a corporation or labor union. &quot;Nonconnected pacs pay every cent of their operating costs out of the donations they receive,&quot; Backer said, &quot;while corporate and labor union pacs don&#39;t. That&#39;s putting a burden on the grassroots. I just think everyone should have the same speech rights--one group shouldn&#39;t be cut off at knees.&quot;&nbsp;But National Defense PAC was familiar with Eustis, or at least his consulting firm, Eusatrix Corporation.

In addition to requiring investment advisers to keep records of campaign contributions and lists of their government clients, the new rules prohibit advisers from representing government entities for two years after the adviser makes a contribution over a certain amount.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Elected officials who allow political contributions to play a role in the management of...assets and who use these assets to reward contributors violate the public trust. Moreover, they undermine the fairness of the process by which public contracts are awarded,&quot; states the SEC rule, issued in July 2010.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Similarly, investment advisers that seek to influence government officials&#39; awards of advisory contracts by making or soliciting political contributions to those officials compromise their fiduciary duties to the pension plans they advise and defraud prospective clients.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.msrb.org/Market-Disclosures-and-Data/Access-Data/Political-Contribution-Disclosures.aspx\">Similar rules </a>administered by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which have been in place since the mid-1990s, require broker-dealers involved in issuing municipal securities to report their campaign contributions publicly. (You can find them <a href=\"http://www.msrb.org/msrb1/pcocweb/search/search.asp\">here.)</a> But under the SEC rules, investment advisers&#39; contribution records are available only internally and to agency staff when they conduct examinations of particular investment advisers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile journalists and members of the public can look up campaign contributions by investment advisers kept by local and state governments, depending on the state or city in question, not all such records are available online or in good quality. And it is not always a simple matter to determine the government client list for a particular adviser--a list which investment advisers must now also keep.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen issuing the rule, the SEC estimated that public pension plans have more than $2.6 trillion of assets and represent one-third of all U.S. pension assets, and noted that the management of these funds affect publicly held companies and the securities markets, not to mention taxpayers and future state and municipal retirees.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tScandals involving &quot;pay to play&quot; schemes have surfaced in New York, New Mexico, Illinois, Ohio, Connecticut, and Florida, and new ones pop up frequently. When he was attorney general of New York State, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., launched a <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/02/08/2-more-firms-reach-settlement-in-ny-pension-fund-inquiry/\">broad investigation</a>--one that is ongoing and has spread to other states--of pay-to-play schemes connected to the pension fund for Empire State workers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn a 2009 report, USA Today <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/funds/2009-08-26-pension-fund-political-donations_N.htm\">found</a> that more than two dozen firms that have been mentioned in corruption investigations gave at least $1.97 million in campaign contributions to officials with potential influence over the funds&#39;s investments.

But they had full coverage of just two of her email accounts--and perhaps not the most interesting ones--because Palin had at least six accounts: one for public contact, one for internal state business, one for anything confidential and others for a mix of state and personal business.</p>\r\n<meta content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" http-equiv=\"content-type\" />\r\n<p>\r\n\tPalin&rsquo;s use of private accounts has been previously reported, but the just-released emails--which Sunlight is making available for search, analysis and download at <a href=\"http://sarahsinbox.com\">Sarah&#39;s Inbox</a>--provide a look inside the accounts, clarify the purpose of each, and reveal correspondence from two accounts that previously were little publicized. Her use of multiple accounts suggest that the public will never see Palin&rsquo;s full state correspondence.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe six boxes of just-released emails include full coverage of governor@gov.state.ak.us, a public address that automatically responded to constituent mail, and govpalin@gov.state.ak.us, an internal address used by her staff and clued-in members of the public, from the start of Palin&rsquo;s term until Sept. 30, 2008, when media outlets first requested them. The released emails are riddled with redactions, and the release includes an 80-page list of emails withheld due to privacy protections. The release also includes messages from Palin&rsquo;s private accounts, but not all of them.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat the emails do show is how Palin used her email addresses--and her multiple inboxes--from the time she became governor up to the time Sen. John McCain tapped her to be his running mate on August 29, 2008. For example, in February 2007, about two months after Palin was sworn in as governor, Kari Spencer, her scheduler, <a href=\"http://sarahsinbox.com/thread/governors-email-address-2/?q=mta\">sent an email</a>&nbsp;to the heads of state agencies in the cabinet. There was just one address to reach the governor, she told them: govpalin@gov.state.ak.us. &ldquo;We are shutting down her personal email accounts (the Yahoo and MTA accounts, messages will not be received at those accounts after today),&rdquo; she wrote.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA week later, something caused Spencer to amend that message: the governor had two email accounts. &ldquo;If you need to send a private or confidential email to the Governor, on non-state email, please use gov.sarah@yahoo.com,&rdquo; she wrote, in <a href=\"http://sarahsinbox.com/thread/governor-sarah-palins-email-addresses-confidenti-2/?q=mta\">an email that was marked confidential</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause Alaska doesn&#39;t archive the private Yahoo accounts of public officials, such &quot;private or confidential&quot; emails would escape open records requests or legal scrutiny.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;For state business of any kind, please use govpalin@gov.state.ak.us,&rdquo; Spencer continued. &ldquo;We really want to use the govpalin@gov.state.ak.us if possible.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn September 2008, the Anchorage Daily News <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/2008/09/14/526281/governors-two-e-mail-accounts.html\">reported</a> that Palin routinely used a Yahoo account to conduct state business. Shortly afterward, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1842097,00.html\">someone hacked one of the personal accounts</a>: gov.palin@yahoo.com. A list of email headers and screenshots of several emails were released, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin_Yahoo_inbox_2008\">published by WikiLeaks</a>, before somebody shut down the account.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe just-released emails include messages to and from Palin&rsquo;s gov.sarah and gov.palin Yahoo accounts. Though, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-palin-emails-20110609,0,6065014.story\">according to</a>&nbsp;the Los Angeles Times, they were included only when a recipient or sender was using official state email. Any email about state business for which both parties were using private addresses is missing from the emails the state released. Emails sent to private accounts often dealt with state business, the released records show, in contravention of Spencer&rsquo;s request to keep state business on a state address.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA list of headers from the hacked gov.palin account, published by WikiLeaks, provides a window on the missing emails. Among those listed is a message from Meghan Stapleton, a Palin advisor and spokeswoman at the time, titled &ldquo;FW: Motor Fuel Tax Suspension,&rdquo; a policy initiative Palin was involved in at the time. While other emails identified by the list are available in the just-released set, the message from Stapleton, dated Aug. 30, 2008,&nbsp;is not among the emails released. Nor is it included in the list of emails withheld from disclosure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile Palin&#39;s Yahoo account became famous during the campaign, the &quot;MTA&quot; account referenced in Spencer&rsquo;s second email hasn&#39;t received as much attention. Spencer&#39;s email doesn&rsquo;t say whether the &ldquo;MTA&rdquo; account was shut down as planned; it seemed to be in operation and was known to cabinet members two months into Palin&rsquo;s tenure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn March 3, 2007, Palin herself referenced the account. After receiving an email sent to and from spalin@mtaonline.net, and copied to two addresses that were later redacted, she <a href=\"http://sarahsinbox.com/thread/fwd-taylor-made1-2/?q=taylormade\">wrote a frantic response</a>: &ldquo;Does anyone know how anyone could send an anonymous email from my old personal account (spalin@mtaonline.net) that I don&#39;t even use. I did NOT send this email.&rdquo; Minutes later, she <a href=\"http://sarahsinbox.com/thread/media-meeting-2/?q=taylormade\">wrote another email</a> to say &ldquo;never mind:&rdquo; she realized Todd Palin had sent the &ldquo;anonymous email,&rdquo; which contained a list of bullet points attacking a wildlife biologist&rsquo;s credentials for office.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn August 22, 2007, an aide <a href=\"http://projects.nytimes.com/palin-emails/date/2007-08-22#p11\">forwarded an email</a> from Joe Miller, a lawyer who would later run for a U.S. Senate seat, to Palin&rsquo;s Yahoo account. The email, which was heavily redacted in the release, discussed a candidate for the Juneau Superior Court. The email had been copied to the mtaonline.net account. &ldquo;You were CC&rsquo;d on the email below with your MTA email address,&rdquo; the aide wrote.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe released emails also show at least two exchanges involving another Palin email account, according to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sarah-palin-e-mails-palin-maintained-third-e-mail-account/2011/06/11/AGc3ahQH_story.html\">a story in The Washington Post</a>. The account &ndash; sp@hslak.com &ndash; was first reported on in October 2008, the Post said. At that time, it was identified as an account run by Frank Bailey, a Palin aide, which used a list of recipients &ldquo;run through&rdquo; PalinForGovernor.com.

In late March, the Council <a href=\"http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/03/28/2011-7005/implementation-of-the-freedom-of-information-act\">published</a> proposed rules on how the FSOC will implement FOIA; comments were due Friday.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;When the government undertakes massive, unprecedented, and costly actions as it did during the recent crisis and as it is doing now in implementing financial reform, government transparency and accountability is essential to maintain public faith in public officials and public institutions&mdash;that is also at stake,&quot; writes the watchdog group <a href=\"http://www.bettermarkets.com/\">Better Markets </a>in its <a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FSOC-2011-0004-0005\">comment</a> letter.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBetter Markets was founded in 2010 to monitor transparency in the global and capital markets; its CEO, Dennis Kelleher, formerly was a Democratic staffer on Capitol Hill, and its founder, Michael W.

Only nine comment letters are available at <a href=\"http://regulations.gov\">regulations.gov</a> at the time of this posting.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSeveral other advocacy groups also urged the FSOC to strengthen the proposed rules. Americans for Financial Reform, a <a href=\"http://ourfinancialsecurity.org/about/our-coalition/\">coalition</a> that includes consumer and labor groups, <a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FSOC-2011-0004-0009\">voices</a> many of the criticisms articulated by Better Markets. The groups Public Citizen and the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) also <a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FSOC-2011-0004-0007.1\">criticize</a> the proposal in a joint comment letter. The groups argue that the requirements for a request to be deemed &quot;complete&quot; are too onerous and that the Council should expand the definition of circumstances in which expedited processing would be granted, among other criticisms. OMB Watch also <a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FSOC-2011-0004-0008\">warns</a> that the technical requirements for a request are too burdensome and urges the agency to proactively post responses to FOIA requests online.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlso <a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FSOC-2011-0004-0011\">weighing</a> in is the National Archives, which applauds the FSOC for proposing to make records available on a discretionary basis even when a FOIA exemption could apply, and quotes President Barack Obama&#39;s 2009 directive on FOIA, &quot;[A]n agency should not withhold information simply because it may do so legally. I strongly encourange agencies to make discretionary disclosures of information.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tComments from industry were more scarce. A comment <a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FSOC-2011-0004-0003.1\">letter</a> filed jointly by the American Insurance Association and the American Council of Life Insurers is concerned that the proposed regulations should be tightened to ensure that financial institutions&#39; records are withheld from public persual. For example, the groups worry that language saying the council has discretionary authority to release records &quot;is too broad&quot; and does not take into account the &quot;highly senstive nature&quot; of the information.

The Perkins Coie letter does not ask about a specific politician or party official or fundraising event, but rather whether Bopp&#39;s Republican Super PAC strategy complies with FEC rules.

Though federal election law currently bars such organizations from coordinating with party committees and candidates, Bopp argues that,&nbsp;&quot;There&rsquo;s no coordination issue. What you can&rsquo;t coordinate is the expenditure of funds. We don&rsquo;t coordinate the spending with anyone.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe further stated that the ban on candidates and party officials raising soft money does not apply to independent expenditure-only groups. &quot;The law provides that a candidate can solicit hard money,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Perkins Coie advisory opinion letter does not raise the soft money/hard money distinction -- whether contributions to independent expenditure-only committees are indeed hard money that candidates can solicit, even if they can&#39;t direct how that money is spent -- but asks instead whether candidates can raise funds for Super PACs, or alternatively participate in Super PAC fundraisers without soliciting funds.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerkins Coie is the law firm of current White House Counsel Robert Bauer.

In the 2010 election, those committees spent more than $60.7 million influencing federal elections in the 2010 election cycle.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/55553997/rspac\">invitation</a> to the Republican Super PAC sales pitch in Dallas says that the group &quot;is designed to give national and state Republican political party committees and local, state and, federal Republican candidates the ability to raise unlimited individual and corporate contributions for independent expenditures in support of federal and state candidates.&quot; It will do so by asking candidates and party committees to &quot;solicit and direct federal and state contributions from donors, above the current state and federal contribution and source limitations, to RSPAC as earmarked funds for independent expenditures supporting or opposing specifically designated federal and/or state candidates or candidates.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBopp told the Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group that while the Republican Super PAC will differ from others in its direct appeal for fundraising help from federal candidates and committees, it won&#39;t run afoul of current election law. &quot;There&rsquo;s no coordination issue,&quot; he said. &quot;What you can&rsquo;t coordinate is the expenditure of funds. We don&rsquo;t coordinate the spending with anyone.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnder the plan, donors, and not the candidates or party committees that solicited them, would earmark the funds to support or oppose specific candidates. The Super PAC would spend the money in those races by itself. &quot;We&rsquo;re not going to talk to [candidates who solicit funds for Republican Super PAC] in any way,&quot; Bopp said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe invitation to the Dallas event, where Bopp hopes the state-level officials can be persuaded find contributors for the group, notes that &quot;RSPAC&#39;s personnel would be firewalled off from appropriate political parties and candidates, and their agents, to prevent coordination and other legal concerns,&quot; and also says that the organization &quot;would coordinate spending with other independent spenders to bridge gaps in the independent campaigns supporting Republican candidates.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBopp said the group, formed under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, will report donors to the FEC. It will also establish state level independent expenditure-only committees.</p>\r\n<div class=\"DV-container\" id=\"DV-viewer-94040-republican-super-pac\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<script src=\"http://s3.documentcloud.org/viewer/loader.js\"></script><script>\r\n  DV.load('http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/94040-republican-super-pac.js', {\r\n    width: 560,\r\n    height: 800,\r\n    sidebar: false,\r\n    container: \"#DV-viewer-94040-republican-super-pac\"\r\n  });\r\n</script>", "date_published": "2011-05-16 13:04:58", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "New-bopp-super-pac", "tags": "James Bopp Jr., FEC, Speech Now, Citizens United, Super PAC", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2348, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-06-10 11:38:26", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2011-05-13 11:17:23", "image": "", "title": "Campaign disclosure foe James Bopp forms Super PAC", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tAttorney <a href=\"http://www.clcblog.org/blog_item-329.html\">James Bopp</a>, who&#39;s a key architect of the legal battle that&#39;s led to a flood of outside spending in elections, has registered a <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/independent-expenditures/letters/C00496349\">new independent expenditure only committee</a>&nbsp;with the Federal Election Commission called the Republican Super PAC Inc.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe filing, which is signed by Bopp and lists him as treasurer, was dated May 11, 2011.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBopp represented and then worked as a legal adviser to Citizens United, the political committee that was the plaintiff in the 2010 Supreme Court case that found that corporations could spend unlimited money on independent expenditures to influence elections.

At St. John&rsquo;s Riverside Hospital, three miles down Broadway from St. Joseph&rsquo;s, the rate was 20 times lower: only one severe bed sore was reported, even though St. John&#39;s discharged far more Medicare patients during that period -- 8,270 to St. Joseph&#39;s 4,541.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOver the protests of groups like the American Hospital Association, Medicare officials this month publicly revealed for the first time where harmful events like these took place.

Representatives from the hospital did not reply to requests for comment by press time.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tExperts say the Medicare data should be used to flag hospitals for further investigation, but caution that the numbers haven&#39;t been adjusted to account for the types of patients different hospitals treat. Some hospitals have much sicker, older and more indigent patients -- all of whom are more likely to develop certain complications in the hospital.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJohn F. Kennedy Medical Center in Edison, NJ, for example, has one of the top ten highest rates in the nation for bloodstream infections caused by catheter use. In an email, Chief Medical Officer Dr. William Oser noted that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) maintains its own records that are adjusted for the types of patients a hospital treats. By the CDC&#39;s accounting, JFK placed very close to the national average on these bloodstream infections, according to Dr. Oser. The CDC doesn&#39;t maintain similar data on bed sores (also known as &quot;pressure ulcers&quot;), so it&#39;s difficult to know just how different St. Joseph&#39;s Medical Center would look if the particular patient mix were taken into account.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile the numbers aren&#39;t perfect, they&#39;re a first-ever attempt by Medicare to publicly report patient safety data on individual hospitals. For the first time, the public can get a general idea of how many Medicare patients are sent home with conditions acquired in the hospital.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/hac/map\"><img alt=\"HAC Map\" src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/map.jpg\" style=\"width: 580px; height: 383px;\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong><em>Click <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/hac/map\">here</a> to view the data in an interactive map.</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFalls and trauma occurred most frequently, with over 70 percent of hospitals reporting at least one incident among patients who were discharged from the hospital between October 1, 2008 and June 30, 2010. At least one person caught a blood or urinary tract infection in about half of the facilities, and nearly a third of hospitals reported at least one instance of a patient developing a severe bed sore.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUntil now, reporting of medical errors and hospital-contracted infections has been largely state-driven, with some states providing much more information than others. These new numbers -- which represent only about 60 percent of the <a href=\"http://www.aha.org/aha/resource-center/Statistics-and-Studies/fast-facts.html\">nation&#39;s hospitals</a>, affect only Medicare patients, and include just eight categories -- are a first glimpse into the world of medical errors.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSince 2008, Medicare no longer pays for <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/HospitalAcqCond/06_Hospital-Acquired_Conditions.asp#TopOfPage\">certain conditions</a> that patients acquire in the hospital, a move mandated by the <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=14747\">Deficit Reduction Act of 2005</a> to reduce healthcare costs and discourage hospitals from harming patients. The Affordable Care Act requires that Medicaid follow suit.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe American Hospital Association opposed the reporting of what Medicare calls &quot;hospital-acquired conditions,&quot; raising questions about how the rates were calculated. In a press release, AHA officials <a href=\"http://www.aha.org/aha/advisory/2011/110325-quality-adv.pdf\">called</a> the specific hospital injuries &quot;important but rare,&quot; and as a result, said they portrayed &quot;an inaccurate and unreliable picture of quality.&quot; In an email, a Medicare representative noted that the hospitals were given 30 days to review their own data before it was published. The numbers were based on claims each facility is required by law to submit to Medicare.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe National Quality Forum hasn&#39;t reviewed and endorsed the specific methods Medicare used to calculate error rates, but president and CEO Janet M. Corrigan said the events themselves are very important and useful information to the public. &quot;These are the kinds of occurences that are entirely or largely preventable,&quot; she said, &quot;Safe institutions can reduce them to very, very low levels.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOther experts warn that any data based on claims billed to Medicare can fall victim to a complicated coding process that relies on the knowledge of the healthcare workers that identify the problems.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is especially true of infections caught in the hospital, according to Dr. Edward J. Septimus, president of the Texas Infectious Diseases Society. A hospital with high rates of hospital-acquired infections could come out looking worse than it should if a doctor there mistakes a blood sample that has been contaminated for a real infection. &quot;The claims are based on physician documentation,&quot; he said. &quot;Physicians are not always knowledgeable about the definitions that we [epidemiologists] use.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOther times, healthcare workers might miss conditions that patients already had on admission. A hospital with very few pressure sores could simply have especially vigilant nurses who discover and record pre-existing sores as patients are being admitted, while workers at other hospitals assume they developed in house.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;I think it&rsquo;s fair (to release the data) as long as everybody agrees on what the limitations are, and what the caveats are,&quot; said Arthur Levin, director of the Center for Medical Consumers, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization based in New York. &quot;There are those who say this data isn&rsquo;t ready for prime time and public review. If we waited for perfection, we wouldn&rsquo;t have anything out there.&quot;</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-04-25 11:28:08", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "medical-errors-2", "tags": "Medicare, medical errors, hospital errors, centers for disease control", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2331, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-08-18 14:59:30", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 4, "timestamp": "2011-04-18 17:18:11", "image": "", "title": "What we don't know about doctors", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tAs political debate rages in Washington about how to reform the nation&rsquo;s $509 billion Medicare system, a hearing is taking place in a Florida courtroom today about making data available to the public on how much individual physicians are paid under the program.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThough the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates that some&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11409t.pd\">$48 billion</a>&nbsp;in improper payments were billed last year to the massive federal program--much of which is driven by health care providers including physicians--the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) maintains that a 1979 court order bars publication of government records showing the amount that individual doctors bill to Medicare.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwo senators--Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Wyden, D-Ore. have&nbsp;introduced legislation that would make such data available to the public. Their bill, <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-s756/show\">S. 756</a>, would overturn the 32-year-old injunction issued by a Florida court --sought by the American Medical Association, the leading lobby for doctors nationwide, and now being challenged in court by Dow Jones, the parent company of the Wall Street Journal--that forbade the government from making such information widely available.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe senators introduced the bill on the heels of a major investigation by the Wall Street Journal and the Center for Public Integrity using Medicare data they obtained from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). Among the findings: billing records of <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424052748704696304575538112856615900-lMyQjAxMTAwMDIwNjEyNDYyWj.html#articleTabs%3Darticle\">one physician</a>, which totaled $2 million in 2008, showed she ordered several expensive tests that raise concern for federal fraud authorities; an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703858404576214642193925996.html?KEYWORDS=medicare+data\">Oregon surgeon</a> who had one of the highest rates of repeat spinal surgeries, and a Miami-based <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704457604576011382824069032.html\">general practice doctor</a> who billed the federal government for more than a million dollars in physical therapy treatments&mdash;24 times the national average.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccess to the billing records, argue the senators, can help cut down on Medicare fraud and abuse. &ldquo;I believe transparency in the health care system leads to more accountability and thus less waste and more efficient use of scare resources,&rdquo; said Grassley in April on the Senate floor when introducing the bill.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Wall Street Journal and the Center for Public Integrity paid $12,000 to obtain payment data in a settlement with the agency after suing it under the Freedom of Information Act. But because of the standing Florida court injunction, they were asked to sign an agreement saying that they would not use these data to identify individual doctors&rsquo; names. Instead they could only report names if they independently verified the information. They also are not permitted to share the raw data with the public.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn fiscal year 2010, CMS <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/foia/reports/10anlrpt.html\">denied</a> 7,600 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests based on the privacy exemption, which was cited in the 1979 court decision&mdash;invoking it more than any other agency within HHS. The agency does not provide statistics on how many of these requests were denied to protect physicians&rsquo; identities as opposed to patients&rsquo; identities. (There is no controversy over keeping private the identities of individuals treated under Medicare.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe American Medical Association (AMA) is already making noise about the legislation. Congressional staffers say they have heard from the group. Ardis Dee Hoven, chair of the AMA Board <a href=\"http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2011/04/04/gvl10404.htm\">told</a> Ameican Medical News, the organization&#39;s trade publication, that it &ldquo;intends to vigorously defend the current injunction, which protects the privacy of physician data while allowing it to be seen by the agencies working to identify fraud.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another statement, an AMA official, J. James Rohack, claims that releasing such information could make physicians vulnerable to identity theft.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe group reported deploying 45 lobbyists and spending <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=American+Medical+Assn&amp;year=2010\">$22.6 million</a> on federal lobbying last year, as well as contributing <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00000422\">$1.1 million</a> to federal candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). Lobbying reports filed this week showed that the group reported spending $4.3 million on lobbying during the first quarter of this year and its PAC has distributed $123,000.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>More than thirty years ago, In Florida&hellip;</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt was the AMA, along with its Florida chapter, the Florida Medical Association, which successfully argued in court more than three decades ago to keep these data secret.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 1977, the department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the predecessor to today&rsquo;s U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), released the names of providers and groups of providers that had collected $100,000 or more in 1975 from the Medicare program. Plans were also afoot to release all the data on payments to physicians.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut the judge agreed with the doctors&#39; group when he wrote that releasing such information was &ldquo;clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy,&rdquo; and violated the privacy exemption&mdash;known as 552(b)(6)--under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSince then, there have been several lawsuits where parties asked for the Medicare data, the most recent <a href=\"http://www.dowjones.com/pressroom/presskits/secrets/secretsofsystem.asp\">filed</a> this year by Dow Jones, the parent company of the Wall Street Journal. A hearing in that case is scheduled for today, Thursday, April 21.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn December 2009 a federal appeals court <a href=\"http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2010/01/11/gvl10111.htm\">overturned</a> a district court decision ordering HHS to release Medicare claims data for four states, which had been requested by <a href=\"http://www.rtmd.org/\">Real Time Medical Data</a>. The private company markets data to hospitals, physicians, and other groups that want to analyze how their practices compare to others.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlso in 2009, a federal appeals court <a href=\"http://www.checkbook.org/press/doc/CHECKBOOK_Medicare_press_release_2009_02_03.pdf \">reversed</a> another district court decision that had ordered HHS to release Medicare payment data to a Consumer&rsquo;s Checkbook, a nonprofit consumer organization. The group had planned to used the data to create a free online service that would give consumers information about how often particular doctors perform a specific procedure to help them when choosing a physician.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn that ruling, a majority of the Court said releasing the data would violate physicians&rsquo; privacy because it would be possible to calculate a physician&rsquo;s total income from Medicare.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Center for Public Integrity and the Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s saga</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDavid Donald, the data editor for the Center for Public Integrity, had wanted to collaborate with the Wall Street Journal on a big investigative project. So in 2009,&nbsp; when at a conference on computer assisted reporting, he and Maurice Tamman of the Journal, came up with a plan.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThey would go after Medicare data&mdash;because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the biggest baddest database that nobody has ever messed with,&rdquo; says Tamman.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDonald prepared a FOIA request. When the agency stalled and never officially responded (although in a conversation, Donald was told the information was &ldquo;not FOIA-ble&rdquo;), CPI filed a lawsuit under FOIA.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSoon CPI got a call from the Justice Department. The attorney was interested in settling by providing detailed data to the two groups, but for a hefty fee, and stipulating they would not reveal physicians&rsquo; names. The first cost estimate came in at around $97,000, which CPI negotiated down to $12,000. &nbsp;&ldquo;Most news organizations would not be able to afford that,&rdquo; says Donald about the fee the two organizations paid.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe two groups then received an enormous amount of information&mdash;some 2.3 terrabytes worth, according to Donald. Some of the tables have more than 1,600 columns. Even then, what they got, subsets of information called Limited Data Set Files, represent only a random selection of five percent of Medicare recipients. Because certain of these files are considered to supply information that could be traced to individual doctors or patients, recipients must sign a privacy agreement with the agency. The agreement also prevents them from making the raw data available publicly.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the months that have followed, the two organizations have published numerous stories based on the data. For example, CPI <a href=\"http://www.publicintegrity.org/articles/entry/2876/\">reported</a> here on how Medicare claims for older women for digital mammography have skyrocketed, despite the fact that such technology is not proven to detect cancers in this population.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis WSJ <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703625304575116040870004462.html\">report</a> on how home health care companies--including the nation&#39;s largest, Amedisys--may be gaming the reimbursement system prompted an investigation by the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a Senate committee.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJournal reporters were even contacted by state auditors and CMS itself to give advice on how to use the data.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, what is even more notable are stories that the WSJ and CPI cannot do because of limits imposed by their use agreement with CMS. For example, the WSJ&#39;s lawyers say that its reporters could not identify a psychiatrist who has billed the program for physical therapy treatments at a level 25 times above the standard deviation of the average of all physicians who specialize in in such therapy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn another <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703395204576024023361023138.html\">story</a>, the WSJ was able to point to a hospital which has one of the highest rates of spinal fusion surgery in the nation--and also is the workplace of five surgeons who were among the largest recipients of payments from the medical device company Medtronic Inc. Because of the use agreement, the WSJ could not reveal details about Medicare payments to these physicians.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;The cases in which the Journal was able to name providers was the exception, not the rule,&quot; reads the Dow Jones motion.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Who uses these data?</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile CPI and the Wall Street Journal had to work hard to obtain these vast stores of data, and even then at a price that would bust most news budgets, CMS regularly provides such detailed data to researchers and others who purchase it and agree to abide by use agreements. (See web page order form <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/FilesForOrderGenInfo/\">here</a>.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGerard Anderson, a <a href=\"http://faculty.jhsph.edu/default.cfm?faculty_id=11\">professor</a> at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health, says that the school first acquired Medicare claims data since 1983, and pays about $10,000 a year to update it. The data allowed him to study the number of people with multiple chronic conditions who seek care under Medicare. He found that two-thirds of Medicare spending by beneficiary goes to people with five or more chronic conditions.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile Anderson does not find the arrangement with CMS onerous, he is supportive of efforts to make the data available more widely. &ldquo;I believe the more information the better, so for you to be able to look at how much your doctor charges and how they do things&mdash;I don&rsquo;t see any downside to it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the Sunlight Foundation asked CMS what entities purchase these data and how much the agency collected in fees for it, we were told we would need to file a FOIA. (We did.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRecently, HHS has begun to provide some data to the public at the new site<a href=\"http://healthdata.gov\"> healthdata.gov</a>.

Under the Dodd-Frank financial law, Geithner was given authority to make this <a href=\"http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/10/29/2010-27437/determination-of-foreign-exchange-swaps-and-forwards\">decision</a>, which he is expected to announce any day.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAmounting in the trillions of dollars per day, foreign exchange swaps are used in business to hedge bets on transactions involving different currencies. Typically, two parties will make an agreement to exchange currencies at a certain rate at a particular time in the future. In this way they hedge risk that an exchange rate may change in a way that would hurt one of the parties. At the height of the financial crisis, in October 2008, the Federal Reserve Board injected $2.9 trillion into the foreign exchange markets to help stablize them, according to <a href=\"http://www.bettermarkets.com/assets/pdf/FX-Ltr-Supp-2-25-11.pdf\">analysis</a> by the Wall Street watchdog group Better Markets.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGeithner reported meeting on February 10 with HSBC Holdings CEO <a href=\"http://www.hsbc.com/1/2/newsroom/media-kit/media-kit-biographies#top\">Stuart Thomson Gulliver</a>; HSBC Finance Corporation CEO Niall Scott Kilgour Booker, and former Goldman Sachs president John Lawson Thornton, <a href=\"http://www.hsbc.com/1/2/about/board-of-directors\">now</a> an HSBC board member.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe meeting between Geithner and the HSBC executives was one of two Geithner has had with representatives of banks on the issue of foreign exchange swaps, according to meeting logs recently released by the agency. Another meeting in January featured a group of 19 CEOs and executives from such institutions as Barclay&#39;s and Credit Suisse.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOther Treasury officials have also met with outsiders on foreign exchange swaps. Six out of seven of those meetings were with representatives of large banks and financial institutions, such as Citi, Blackrock, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Morgan Stanley. One of the meetings, on November 20, was with a range of consumer groups, unions, and academics--including Better Markets--which has pressed against an exemption.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe request for comments posted by Treasury last fall drew dozens of comments, most from banks and financial institutions that support an exemption. Comments also came from non-financial groups such as Philip Morris and 3M. The Coalition of End Users of Derivatives, which <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/big-business-seeks-exemption-from-derivatives-rules/\">counts</a> large trade associations and companies as members and has been pressing for a carve out from derivatives rules, also weighed in.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAmong the dissenters were groups such as Americans for Financial Reform, a <a href=\"http://ourfinancialsecurity.org/about/our-coalition/\">coalition</a> whose members include large unions such as the AFL-CIO and AFSCME as well as consumer and public interest groups. Three Democratic senators--Carl Levin, D-Mich., Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, also wrote in to oppose an exemption.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;No justification for an exemption is evident,&quot; states the letter from Cantwell and Harkin. &quot;Any broad exclusion from the law will weaken comprehensive regulation of the derivatives market, and create opportunities to structure swap transactions to evade regulation.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe banking and financial industries, in contrast, have argued that foreign exchange swaps are not like derivatives and do not pose systemic risk.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGeithner is widely seen as sympathetic to the banks&#39; point of view. In testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee in 2009, he <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/12/02/us-financial-geithner-highlights-idUSTRE5B13JW20091202\">said</a>, &quot;The FX markets are different. They are not really derivative in a sense and they don&#39;t present the same sort of risk and there is an elaborate framework in place already to limit settlement risk. These markets actually work quite well.&quot; But some reports <a href=\"http://forex.fo/?Keywords=UPDATE%202-Geithner%20won%27t%20shield%20forex%20options-sources&amp;n=OTU5Mg==\">speculate</a> he may take a middle road, subjecting some swaps to oversight and exempting others.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span>The Treasury Department and HSBC did not return requests for comment by the time of this posting.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span>The recently released Treasury meeting logs for the month of February report 37 meetings relating to implementation of the Dodd-Frank law held by officials with representatives from outside groups.

The Affordable Care Act requires that Medicaid follow suit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe American Hospital Association opposed the reporting of what Medicare calls &quot;hospital-acquired conditions,&quot; raising questions about how the rates were calculated. In a press release, AHA officials <a href=\"http://www.aha.org/aha/advisory/2011/110325-quality-adv.pdf\">called</a> the specific hospital injuries &quot;important but rare,&quot; and as a result, said they portrayed &quot;an inaccurate and unreliable picture of quality.&quot; In an email, a Medicare representative noted that the hospitals were given 30 days to review their own data before it was published. The numbers were based on claims each facility is required by law to submit to Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe National Quality Forum hasn&#39;t reviewed and endorsed the specific methods Medicare used to calculate error rates, but president and CEO Janet M. Corrigan said the events themselves are very important and useful information to the public. &quot;These are the kinds of occurences that are entirely or largely preventable,&quot; she said, &quot;Safe institutions can reduce them to very, very low levels.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPatient safety groups say more studies need to be done to determine how many patients are harmed by conditions they develop at the hospital.

The congressman&rsquo;s chief of staff, LaVerne Alexander, has not supplied a copy of the letter despite repeated requests. Neither Alexander nor a spokesman for Bachus, who sent a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/78090-01-26-11-ltr-to-sec-geithner.html\">letter</a> to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner in January, responded to a request to comment for this story.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tActivists have targeted Renco Group in the complex dispute, which involves an inactive metal smelter in the town of La Oroya, Peru, which the <a href=\"http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org\">Blacksmith Institute</a> labeled one of the <a href=\"http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/projects/display/36\">ten most polluted places</a> on earth in 2006.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Renco Group acquired the smelter, which had been in operation since 1922, in 1997 from the Peruvian government; as part of the privatization deal, both sides agreed to take steps to clean up La Oroya. In 2009, the company suspended operations at the site, blaming the slowdown in the world economy. In July 2010, the government of Peru revoked the company&#39;s operating license.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDoe Run Peru is currently in bankruptcy proceedings in Peru, where creditors will decide whether to liquidate or restructure it within weeks, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bnamericas.com/story.jsp?sector=8&amp;noticia=549424&amp;idioma=I&amp;source=\">Business News Americas</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn its filing for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/RencoGroupVPeru_NOI.pdf\">arbitration</a>&nbsp;in December, Doe Run Peru claimed that if its assets were expropriated, the government of Peru would be violating the U.S.-Peru free trade agreement by breaking investment agreements. The claim also stated that Peru has not fulfilled its environmental cleanup responsibilities and has not granted the company adequate extensions in time to complete its own environmental projects. The Peruvian government recently&nbsp;<a href=\"http://peru21.pe/noticia/735733/multaron-doe-run-7-millones\">fined Doe Run Peru</a>&nbsp;about $2.5 million for failing to meet some of its environmental obligations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe company, in a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/government-of-perus-actions-toward-doe-run-peru-said-to-violate-trade-treaty-between-united-states-and-peru-112954504.html\">press release</a>&nbsp;from earlier this year, blamed the environmental degradation on the government-owned firm, which operated the smelter before 1997.&nbsp;Renco spokesman&nbsp;Andrew Shea<strong>&nbsp;</strong>has not yet responded to questions for this article.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo press its case in Washington, the Renco Group hired five different lobbying firms in a span of less than three months; eight former government officials represent the company, including a former chief of staff of Payne&#39;s.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tActivists have sought to mount their own campaign to counter Renco&#39;s efforts.&nbsp;Alexa Smith, who works with the hunger campaign of the Presbyterian Church in Louisville, Ky., estimated that hundreds of letters have been sent, mostly to Secretaries Clinton and Geithner.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe coordinator of the environmental coalition, called Friends of La Oroya, is a St. Louis-based Presbyterian Rev. Elinor Stock, has been advocating for the health of people in La Oroya for almost a decade.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;Doe Run is not the victim here. The people [of La Oroya] are the most vulnerable,&ldquo; she said. &ldquo;Doe Run is using clauses in the free trade treaties to justify the non-compliance and continued procrastination of their environmental responsibilities,&rdquo; she added.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne Presbytery in New Jersey, Payne&#39;s home state, sent about 60 missives to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, according to Rev. Phyllis Zoon, a hunger advocate for the Monmouth, N.J. Presbytery. On Mar. 25, Zoon said she met with Payne&rsquo;s chief of staff in Washington, D.C. to express her concerns about Doe Run Peru.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRev. Stock&#39;s concern for La Oroya hit close to home. In the early 2000s, at about the time when her church began working with a network of Peruvian groups over contamination in La Oroya, Doe Run Peru was then a subsidiary of Renco-owned Doe Run Resources, which operated a lead-producing plant in Herculaneum, Mo.

Some can be more lengthy: Exhibits AB are filed when a firm begins representing a new foreign client, and often contain the written contract spelling out the services the foreign agent will provide for the client.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe initial Registration and the Supplemental Statements, filed every six months thereafter, can be the most informative, providing information on the firm&#39;s partners, what kind of public relations and lobbying a firm engages in on behalf of a foreign government, businesses or sometimes even an individual. It also lists the various campaign contributions made by lobbyists and itemized payments made to the lobbying firm. Some of these documents from 2008 and 2009 are in a database format <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org\">here</a> and should be updated with more recent filings soon.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDocuments titled Exhibit B in the tracker includes the contractual agreement between the foreign entity and the lobbying firm, including how much they are spending to lobby while ones titled Exhibit C include detailed information about the lobbying companies, such as their bylaws and articles of incorporation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor more information and to search by country, explore the <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/\">Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker</a> for filings from previous years where you can find all foreign lobbying ranging from the <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/one-foreign-agent-we-never-expected-to-find-819\">Dalai Lama</a> to <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/libya-and-algeria-rocked-protest-have-history-us-lobbying/\">Muammar Ghaddafi</a>.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-04-06 10:27:04", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "new-foreign-lobbying-feature-lobbying-tracker", "tags": "FARA, foreign lobbying, lobbying tracker ", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2325, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-04-06 10:13:37", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2011-04-05 17:43:39", "image": "", "title": "No surprises in Obama reelection campaign FEC filings", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tThe Obama reelection campaign--and the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2011/04/05/135153197/presidential-hopefuls-raise-lots-of-cash-good-luck-finding-out-from-whom\">$1 billion fundraising effort</a> that will pay for it--officially launched yesterday.

These networks, called &quot;Accountable Care Organizations&quot; or ACO&#39;s, have been a target of lobbying by physicians&#39; groups in the past year and a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/09/AR2011010904138_pf.html\">source of concern</a> for some over the shifting balance of power between health care players.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMedicare&#39;s &quot;Shared Savings Program&quot; would award physicians higher payments if they met certain quality standards if the ACO they belonged to also held down the growth of costs.

For example, Rep. James Moran, D-Va., recently claimed that he&rsquo;d managed to <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/147347-house-appropriator-we-know-how-to-get-around-earmark-ban\">direct funds</a>&nbsp;to his pet projects, and there have been reports of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/appropriations/135291-spending-watchdogs-home-in-on-lettermarking-as-threat-next-year\">other lawmakers</a>&nbsp;attempting to do the same.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHow the new earmarking process without earmarks might work has yet to be uncovered, but there may be a clue in an unlikely source: Emails released by <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/02/how-one-security-firm-tracked-anonymousand-paid-a-heavy-price.ars\">a group of hackers</a> who targeted HBGary Federal, a cybersecurity firm that was <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/02/the-ridiculous-plan-to-attack-wikileaks.ars/\">seeking</a> to out members of the group, known as Anonymous, who attacked a series of firms that stopped doing business with WikiLeaks after that organization published thousands of U.S. government documents. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne of the email threads released by the hackers contained correspondence between July 2008 and September 2010 Greg Hoglund, CEO of HBGary, his wife Penny Leavy-Hoglund, the company&rsquo;s President, and Marilyn Erbes, the district director for Lungren. In a Sept. 13, 2010 email, Erbes offered to schedule a meeting about Lungren&#39;s appropriations process in response to an email from an email from Leavy-Hoglund.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe H.B. Gary president had written three days earlier, &quot;I&#39;d like to see if we can get an earmark or funding in a bill to see if we can continue to train law enforcement on malware and catching criminals using the computer.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tErbes told the Sunlight Foundation that Lungren&#39;s office did not seek any federal funds on the company&#39;s behalf.&nbsp;She explained that the interview was informational there was no intention of earmarking funds to the company, but the office wanted to learn more about the company, &ldquo;hear their needs and explore projects.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tErbes responded to Leavy-Hoglund&#39;s request for an earmark by suggesting that Lungren&#39;s office could potentially help HBGary seek funding through a federal grant. &ldquo;Perhaps you and I can have a separate conversation about earmark and appropriation funding. We handle the appropriations process out of our district office and I would be happy to explain the process and perhaps discuss our process in support of grant funding.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne way that members of Congress and their staffs can influence spending without earmarking funds is to help walk organizations through the grant process. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ross.house.gov/ConstituentServices/HelpWithGrants.htm\">Rep. Mike Ross D- Ark</a>, outlines on his website, &ldquo;I encourage applicants to contact my office for assistance. I can write letters on behalf of a grant application to alert agencies of my support of a project.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCongressional letters carry weight and can influence spending.&nbsp;&ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/us/politics/28earmarks.html?pagewanted=all\">Lettermarking</a>&rdquo; refers to Congressmen writing to various agencies to direct funding to their home districts.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLeavy-Hoglund also explains in the email to Erbes that HBGary has benefited from federal funds in the past. &quot;[W]e were funded by three phase 2 SBIRs [Small Business Innovation Research grants]. Two from the Air force&nbsp;(Wright Patterson) and one from DHS Science and Technology...</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t&quot;[B]ecause of the funding, we are able to hire in Sacramento. This means jobs in a depressed economy.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe House Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities has&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/03/congress-and-hbgary/\">requested any contracts</a>&nbsp;the Defense Department may have signed with HBGary.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn private correspondence, Leavy-Hoglund playfully bragged of her lobbying skills to her husband. &ldquo;Who says I have to pay for a lobbyist. I think it could be my next career.&rdquo; She did not register as a federal lobbyist, and most likely wasn&#39;t required to: only individuals who spend more than 20 percent of their time lobbying must file disclosures with the House and Senate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThough Lungren agreed to the ban on earmarks, he has been critical of other efforts to cut government spending, and opposed a measure sponsored by Rep. Michelle Bachman, R- Minn., to cut the budgets of federal agencies by a percentage rather than achieving spending cuts by choosing individual programs to slash. On the <a href=\"http://frwebgate1.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/TEXTgate.cgi?WAISdocID=4QW6lF/0/1/0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve\">House floor</a>&nbsp;Lungren complained, &ldquo;Across-the-board cuts are a lazy member&#39;s way to achieve something.

The House Committee on Administration provides two sets of numbers: summary numbers for each office&#39;s spending by quarter, including a grand total and a breakdown by category, and detailed files listing every disbursement reported for that quarter. There is a discrepancy between the totals reported in the summary section and the totals arrived at by adding all of the individual disbursements reported in the detail view of our downloadable data. Despite the discrepancy, a review of the data shows that both sets of numbers are accurate, as far as they go.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter combing through several dozen pages of PDF documents to get to the bottom of this, we noticed that there are hundreds of rows of expenditures reported each quarter that do not appear to be included in the aggregation of the various categories of expenditures such as &quot;personnel compensation&quot; or travel that are used to calculate the summary numbers. When we did some additional research and made several calls to the House offices to find out why the numbers were not always adding up we learned that some of the line items from the PDF files that cover calendar year 2010 are actually disbursements made in 2009, or, in some cases, even earlier. Members can report disbursements up to three years after they were made.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the spokesperson at the House Committee on Administration, those expenses which come in late should be calculated as part of the member representational allowance (MRA) for that specific year.&nbsp;To reflect that, <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011-disbursement-tables/\">we will change numbers</a> for some of the lawmakers, for instance, Rep. Nancy Pelosi&#39;s, D-Calif., amounts will be $1,659,836 while Rep. Jim Costa&#39;s, D-Calif., amounts will be $1,565,495.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThus, for agreggate numbers, users should&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/projects/expenditures/\">consult&nbsp;</a>the summary table, but be aware that those summary numbers may understate how much a member&#39;s office spent in a quarter or a year. Any number reported in the quarterly summaries may understate the actual spending because 2010 disbursements can be reported as late as 2013.&nbsp;To look at specific expenditures--travel, salaries for individual congressional staffers and so on, the detailed files should be used.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile we took into account anything that is paid out in any of the quarters of 2010 to be aggregated, to get a more conservative account of the spending coming from the 2010 MRA alone, line items from 2009 or 2008 reported in the 2010 files should be excluded.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the end, what we have here are numbers which are as close to the real ones as possible given the several hurdles created by the House&#39;s rules on how this information is reported and the manner in which the data is presented in non-machine readable PDF files.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-03-24 13:56:58", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "update-house-disbursements-few-notes-how-use-data", "tags": "", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2314, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-03-23 15:04:40", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 12, "timestamp": "2011-03-22 23:07:38", "image": "", "title": "One year after passage, health care reform continues to generate lobbying and legal fees", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tOne year ago today, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law.

Those interests included pharmaceutical firms and their trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, insurers like Blue Cross/Blue Shield, the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, universities, retailers, restaurant chains, manufacturers, telecommunications firms and labor unions.<br />\r\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www-958.ibm.com/me/visualizations/a2d26aa254fb11e080ff000255111976/comments/a2f44bc254fb11e080ff000255111976.js\"></script><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat lobbying continues in 2011. More than 180 firms have registered to lobby for new clients on health care issues so far in 2011, 16 of which disclosed the Affordable Care Act as a specific lobbying interest, according to <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/lobbying/issue/health-issues\">Sunlight&#39;s Lobbying Registration Tracker</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHealth care was a major issue in the 2010 campaign, in which outside groups spent more than <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/independent-expenditures/totals\">$454 million</a>. The newly elected Republican majority voted <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h2011-14\">unanimously</a> for a bill dubbed &quot;Repeal the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act,&quot; but the measure, which would surely face a presidential veto were it to pass, remains stalled in the Senate, where Democrats have the majority.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile many of the act&#39;s major changes have yet to take effect, the administration has already <a href=\"http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/approved_applications_for_waiver.html\">exempted</a> more than 1,000 groups from one of its requirements: the mandate to provide at least $750,000 in annual coverage per enrollee. About 2.6 million individuals with so-called &quot;mini-med&quot; plans are affected by these waivers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe exemptions last for only one year, and are scheduled to be phased out in 2014, when states will be required to operate exchanges -- marketplaces where individuals can purchase coverage. The waivers are designed as a temporary stopgap to prevent beneficiaries from being dropped from coverage or priced out of it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile small businesses were among those given the reprieve this year, including Captain Elliot&#39;s Party Boats, with 10 enrollees, and Hoosier Stamping and Manufacturing Corp., with 14, waivers were also granted to huge insurance companies. Aetna received an exemption for plans that cover over 209,000 enrollees, and Cigna&#39;s waiver affected 265,000.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"425px\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://data.sunlightlabs.com/w/vxvv-xvkb/38mm-etse?cur=g2cB0NrlluO&amp;from=root\" title=\"Groups receiving waivers\" width=\"500px\">&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;http://data.sunlightlabs.com/Government/Groups-receiving-waivers/vxvv-xvkb&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; _cke_saved_href=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;http://data.sunlightlabs.com/Government/Groups-receiving-waivers/vxvv-xvkb&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; title=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;Groups receiving waivers&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; target=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;_blank&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Groups receiving waivers&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;</iframe>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<a href=\"http://www.socrata.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Powered by Socrata</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe political fallout from the waivers has fallen along party lines, with critics <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/health/policy/20health.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\">charging</a> that they&#39;re an indication of the burdens imposed by the law and may encourage favoritism.

States were also allowed to apply for a waiver on behalf of several insurers, often because state law is at odds in some way with the federal reform act. In New Jersey, for example, insurers are required to provide affordable plans -- many of which have annual limits under $750,000. </i></span></p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe architects of health reform have attempted to minimize political challenges this year, front-loading the act with some of its most popular changes. New health plans can <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/ChildrensPCIP/childrenspcip.html\">no longer</a> deny coverage to children with pre-existing conditions; plans are required to allow children to remain on their parents&#39; plans until age 26, and Medicare patients who fall into the so-called &quot;donut hole&quot; gap in prescription drug coverage get a 50 percent discount on certain covered brand-name drugs. As we reported <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/lobbying-dollars-flow-health-care-reform/\">last year</a>, insurance companies must now also spend a certain portion of patient dollars on care rather than overhead -- a provision for which the state of Maine recently received a <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/health-reform-implementation/148179-maine-gets-reprieve-from-health-reform-insurance-requirement?page=2#comments\">three-year waiver</a>. Six other states have applied for similar exemptions. And even some of the law&#39;s selling points have had unintended consequences--rather than offer child-only insurance policies regardless of preconditions, many major insurers simply <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/20/AR2010092006665.html\">stopped offering</a> the plans.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tIn recent <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/146729/One-Year-Later-Americans-Split-Healthcare-Law.aspx\">polls</a>, the country remains split on the law&#39;s merits, with more respondents believing the law will worsen medical care than improve it.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tFour federal courts have ruled on the law, particularly the individual mandate, which requires citizens to purchase insurance or pay what is either a tax or a penalty--there is some dispute as to which term better describes the penalty. Two upheld it and two found all or part of it unconstitutional. Most recently, Florida Federal Judge Roger Vinson struck down the entire act in January on the grounds that the mandate that individuals purchase coverage was unconstitutional.

The director also has a seat on the Financial Stability Oversight Council.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe collapse of giant American Insurance Group in September 2008 was one of the major <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/american_international_group/index.html\">events</a> in the financial meltdown, with the company eventually collecting $182 bilion in federal bailout funds.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMcRaith, who has donated nearly $60,000 to Democratic candidates and party committees over the past decade, including contributions to President Barack Obama&rsquo;s 2008 campaign, has earned plaudits from as disparate groups as the conservative <a href=\"http://outofthestormnews.com/2011/03/17/heartland-institute-comments-on-mcraith-appointment/\">Heartland Institute</a> and the liberal Illinois Citizen Action.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very happy and very sad, because we&rsquo;re sorry to see him leave Illinois,&rdquo; said <a href=\"http://www.citizenaction-il.org/about/staff#delaforgue\" target=\"_blank\">Lynda DeLaforgue</a>, co-director of Illinois Citizen Action.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe also has broad <a href=\"http://www.propertycasualty360.com/2011/03/18/industry-reacts-positively-to-mcraith-fio-appointm?t=regulation-legislation\">support</a> from the insurance industry groups, which issued statements applauding his appointment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut McRaith, who currently serves as secretary-treasurer of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), has testified frequently before Congress on the importance of retaining state authority over insurance.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor example, in 2009, he <a href=\"http://www.naic.org/Releases/2009_docs/systemic_risk_in_insurance.htm\">told</a> a Financial Services Subcommittee, &quot;The state-based insurance regulatory system is one of critical checks and balances, without the perils of a single point of failure and omnipotent decision making&hellip;States have a long history of consumer protection and market stability - the two pillars on which any system of financial stability regulation can, and must, be built.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd in 2008, <a href=\"http://www.naic.org/Releases/2008_docs/treasury_ins_info_office.htm\">testifying</a> about the original proposal to create a federal insurance office, he cautioned that state regulators would object to any federal entity that had authority to preempt state consumer protections or solvency standards.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMcRaith, however, appears to be amenable to collecting data from the industry. Last year he said the NAIC would obtain information from insurance companies about the use of credit scores in auto insurance underwriting, <a href=\"http://www.insurancetech.com/blogs/229300377\">points</a> out the trade journal Insurance and Technology&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome in the insurance industry hope that he will rely on exisiting collections of data rather than mandating new ones. The National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies (NAMIC), which has been <a href=\"http://www.namic.org/newsreleases/110317fd01.asp\">outspoken</a> about its worry that the new office will overreach, <a href=\"http://www.namic.org/newsreleases/110317fd01.asp\">stated</a> that it hoped McRaith, with his state background, will rely on state agencies and associations for data, rather than compelling industry to supply more directly.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMatt Brady, a NAMIC spokesman, said that McRaith could rely, for example, on NAIC for such data as corporate governance information, consumer complaints, claims handling information, and market conduct information.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA request to McRaith&rsquo;s Illinois office for an interview was returned by email with this generic statement, &quot;<font><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" size=\"2\">I am honored to be appointed by Secretary Geithner to be Director of the Federal Insurance Office.

But the data leaves a lot to be desired. In addition to the awkward format, detailed information is unavailable. While members disclose how much they spend on travel, they do not disclose the destinations they went to or the purpose of the trips. Also, terms such as &quot;non-technology service contracts&quot; showing individual or company names as the payees are vague, providing no indication of the purpose of the expenditure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, a change in the methodology in the data released this quarter adds to the ambiguity of the data. Expenditures that previously were divided into many categories are now lumped into fewer categories, making comparisons of this quarter to previous quarters more difficult.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor instance, in previous releases the code for money spent on bottled water was C1, student loan payment was P6 and district office rent was S6. All these codes have now been rolled into one, &quot;AP,&quot; which stands for accounts payable. So while using last quarters&rsquo; documents <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/issues/55_146/-47263-1.html\">this story</a> could be written critiquing the amount Pelosi spent on her California office, it will not be possible to do a similar report using this data in the new format.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-03-21 10:21:16", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "house-members-committees-and-offices-spend-136-billion-2010", "tags": "house disbursements, house expenditures, SOD, statement of disbursements", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2306, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-03-16 13:31:33", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 4, "timestamp": "2011-03-15 11:50:58", "image": "", "title": "Big business seeks exemption from derivatives rules", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tSome of Washington&rsquo;s most powerful trade associations and big corporations are pushing to get an exemption from derivatives regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank financial law&mdash;and House Republicans are planning to introduce legislation to do just that.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnder the umbrella of an ad hoc coalition, known as the Coalition for Derivatives End-Users, which is run by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Business Roundtable, among others, the coalition first weighed in during the debate over the financial law.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSince the law&rsquo;s passage, the coalition has also been presenting its case with financial agencies, attending meetings with staff and <a href=\"http://www.nam.org/~/media/A1E47F8EEF044EE68FFDABDA7F4A6FE4/Coalition_Letter_on_Proposed_Rules_on_the_End_User_Exemption.pdf\">filing</a> comment letters.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt a <a href=\"http://financialservices.house.gov/Hearings/hearingDetails.aspx?NewsID=1800\">hearing</a> today in the House Financial Capital Markets &amp; Government Sponsored Enterprises subcommittee, Republicans are planning to discuss legislation to overturn or limit parts of the Dodd-Frank law.&nbsp; One of the bills, to be sponsored by freshman Rep.

You&rsquo;d think regulators would want to know exactly how much revenue banks are taking in,&rdquo; says Jean Ann Fox, director of financial services with the <a href=\"http://www.consumerfed.org/\">Consumer Federation of America</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe federal regulations came after years of controversy over banks&rsquo; practice of charging hefty overdraft fees--sometimes several times a day--when they overcharged their account even by a small amount. The example often used was the $40 cup of coffee&mdash;overdraw your account by $5, and be hit with a $35 overdraft fee. Most of the nation&rsquo;s largest banks were hit with lawsuits by consumers claiming they had been charged unfairly.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut banks are not required to report to the government precisely how much they collect in overdraft fees.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThey do report overdraft fees as part of a larger category--fees they charge on deposit accounts--in the quarterly &quot;call&quot; reports they file with their supervisory federal agencies. The category also includes a long list of fees such as charges for stop payment orders, certifying checks, general charges on checking accounts, and some ATM fees.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEnd-of-year call reports filed by the nation&rsquo;s largest banks show that most collected less from customers in this category&mdash;known as &quot;sevice charges on deposit accounts (in domestic offices)&quot;&mdash;in 2010 than in 2009. For example, Bank of America, which reported income greater than any other bank, also showed the biggest decline, from $8.5 billion to $6.5 billion. PNC Financial Services, Inc., reported $1.4 billion in 2009 and $1.2 billion in 2010. U.S. Bankcorp&rsquo;s reported decline was from&nbsp; $1.5 billion to $1.3 billion. [See chart.]</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis seems to dovetail with anecdotal reports from banks that their income from overdraft fees has declined. For example, in its most recent annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (whch is different from the call reports cited above), Bank of America <a href=\"http://services.corporate-ir.net/SEC/Document.Service?id=P3VybD1odHRwOi8vaXIuaW50Lndlc3RsYXdidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vZG9jdW1lbnQvdjEvMDAwMDk1MDEyMy0xMS0wMTg3NDMvZG9jL0JhbmtvZkFtZXJpY2FDb3Jwb3JhdGlvbl8xMEtfMjAxMTAyMjUucGRmJnR5cGU9MiZmbj1CYW5rb2ZBbWVyaWNhQ29ycG9yYXRpb25fMTBLXzIwMTEwMjI1LnBkZg==\">said</a> that new overdraft rules and the bank&rsquo;s own policy changes cost the company some $1.6 billion in 2010.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd Moeb&#39;s Services, a private firm which surveys financial insitutions directly, last fall <a href=\"http://www.moebs.com/Pressreleases/tabid/58/ctl/Details/mid/380/ItemID/193/Default.aspx\">predicted</a> that in 2010 banks would earn about the same amount in overdraft fees--$35.4 billion&mdash;as they did in 2008, down from $37.1 billion in 2009, largely because of the new regulations. The firm also <a href=\"http://www.moebs.com/ServicesandProducts/Overdraftservices/OverdraftIntroduction.aspx\">markets</a> a service to financial institutions seeking advice on how to price their overdraft products. News services often cite these statistics in stories about overdraft fees.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe overdraft fees are estimated to be a large portion of the fees they collect on deposit accounts. A 2008 <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/overdraft/\">report</a> by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), done in the run-up to the promulgation of the new regulations, estimated that the overdraft fee income accounts for 74 percent of the fees reported in this line item, and represented some six percent of the total net operating revenues earned by banks. But the FDIC&rsquo;s report was based on a survey of 1,000+ institutions, not on direct reporting by banks.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis mix, however, is expected to change as banks adjust to the new regulatory environment, and shift fees for consumer elsewhere. For example, in January, partly because of the new overdraft regulations, Bank of America announced that it would start charging new fees for customers who maintain low account balances, while customers that bank large amounts will get preferential treatment and higher interest rates, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/05/AR2011010505358.html\">reported</a> the Washington Post.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBanks would report income from such fees under the same category as overdrafts, making it hard to figure out exactly what practice is generating income and how.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMeanwhile, it is also hard for consumers to get the facts directly from banks about what fees they will be charged and under what circumstances. Under the Truth in Savings Act, banks are required to disclose such fees to customers when they open checking or savings accounts. But when the in 2008 General Accountability Office (GAO) sent investigators posing as customers to some 185 bank offices, they were <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08281.pdf\">unable</a> to get detailed information about fees and account terms at more than one-fifth of the banks. They also could not find the information on many of the institutions&rsquo; websites.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Getting into the data weeds</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen we decided to examine what government data were available on overdraft fees charged by banks, getting this simple information turned out to be a lot more complicated than it first seemed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFirst, in a conversation with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) experts, we were <a href=\"https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/\">directed</a> to the individual call reports filed by banks with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Banks file these reports every quarter, and they are available online in pdf format and for bulk download, as well as other formats. The line item that contains overdraft fees, line item 5(b), can be pulled from these data.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, what we consumers typically think of as a bank&mdash;such as Bank of America, or JP Morgan Chase&mdash;is really an amalgamation of several institutions, all of which file separately. For example, JP Morgan Chase has several subsidiaries, two of which&mdash;Chase Bank USA and JP Morgan Chase Bank&mdash;report income under this line item.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe wanted to consolidate these numbers by bank holding company, so that we would get one number per institution.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s possible to create this the long way around, by pulling the hierarchy of ownership for each financial institution <a href=\"http://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/OrgHierarchySearchForm.aspx?parID_RSSD=1073757&amp;parDT_END=99991231\">here</a>. But the hierarchy search form allows a search only for the years 2010 and 2009, and we wanted to go back to 2007.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the end we relied on the consolidated financial statements by bank holding companies, which are available <a href=\"http://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/Top50Form.aspx\">here.</a> (However, these appear to be available only in pdf format, making it difficult to pull information into a spreadsheet.) We looked at the top ten instiituions as measured by total deposits, calculating that from data we got from the FDIC.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe website where these data are posted&mdash;<a href=\"http://www.ffiec.gov/\">here</a>&mdash;is difficult to navigate without a guide.

The firm directly provided <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2050518720090320\">3,500 jobs</a> in Peru, gained the support of many workers and local people, and claims to be a more responsible environmental caretaker than its state-owned predecessor.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYet emissions of lead, sulfur dioxide, and other chemicals were far above the Peruvian air standard while the smelter was operating. In 2005, scientists from St. Louis University <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/world/americas/25peru.html\">concluded</a> that 97 percent of the children there under the age of six had toxic levels of lead in their blood. A 1999 study by the Peruvian Ministry of Health, <a href=\"http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session2/PE/EJ-AIDA_PER_UPR_S2_2008anx_StudyofcontaminationinLaOroya.pdf\">cited by St. Louis University researchers</a>, found that lead levels were so high in nearly 20 percent of children that urgent medical attention was warranted.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome of those contaminants were there long before Doe Run Peru purchased the smelter, which was built in 1922. When the La Oroya smelter was privatized in 1997, Doe Run Peru agreed to a plan to clean up its operations. The Blacksmith Institute, which labeled the town <a href=\"http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/projects/display/36\">one of the ten most polluted places on earth</a> in 2006, offered a <a href=\"http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/docs/laoroya1.pdf\">generally favorable report</a> on the company&rsquo;s efforts in 2008, though other experts were <a href=\"http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/uploads/CRITIQUE.pdf\">critical</a> of the report&rsquo;s conclusions, which were based on a single visit to the facility.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDoe Run Peru shut down the smelter, which produces copper, lead, zinc and other metals, in La Oroya in mid-2009 and the firm has not reopened it since, citing financial problems associated with the global recession. Before the stoppage, the company said it needed yet another extension on the environmental cleanup contract to secure financing from creditors&mdash;after Lima already granted it one in 2006. Despite <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2447539720090924\">being accorded</a> the 2009 extension, the company <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0527661720110105\">did not secure</a> the $150 million needed to finish the environmental cleanup or reach a deal on the $110 million it owed its mining suppliers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSince mid-2009, Doe Run Peru has announced its <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0614864020100106\">intention</a> to restart operations <a href=\"http://doerunperumedia.com.pe/english/2010/05/25/press-release-by-ministry-of-energy-and-mines/?cth=pr\">multiple times</a> and even declared it <a href=\"http://doerunperumedia.com.pe/english/2010/03/08/doe-run-peru-reaches-a-positive-letter-of-intent-with-glencore/?cth=pr\">secured a creditor</a> in March 2010. Yet the facility never reopened, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1420579120100614\">sparking worker protests</a>. Then the government <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2819144720100728\">revoked</a> the company&rsquo;s license last July and will decide <a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/metalsNews/idAFN2928775320101229\">soon</a> whether to liquidate Doe Run Peru.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe company <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/government-of-perus-actions-toward-doe-run-peru-said-to-violate-trade-treaty-between-united-states-and-peru-112954504.html\">has claimed</a> that it is in compliance with&nbsp; &ldquo;its obligations to complete various environmental projects.&rdquo; Renco claims that the Peruvian government, by not cleaning up the soil around the site, has neglected to follow the contractual cleanup contract. The company <a href=\"http://www.miningweekly.com/article/doe-run-peru-faces-renewed-environmental-criticism-2009-03-26\">has reported spending</a> over $300 million on environmental mitigation<strong>.</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs part of the environmental cleanup agreement, the company planned to open a third sulfuric acid plant; however, according to the <a href=\"http://www.osinerg.gob.pe/newweb/uploads/GFM/DOE_RUN-MAYO_2010.pdf\">most recent monitoring report</a> from Peru&rsquo;s mining regulatory body, it was little more than halfway finished as of last year. The facility would vastly reduce emissions, said Anna Cederstav, a scientist at nonprofit law firm Earthjustice. She has been monitoring the situation in La Oroya since 1997.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;The third acid plant, if built, would indeed take care of a very substantial portion of the remaining emissions,&rdquo; she wrote in an email.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFrom Cederstav&rsquo;s discussions with Doe Run Peru about five years before the company shut down operations, she observed, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see any intention on their part to actually build the plant.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen asked about the plant not being finished, Renco&rsquo;s spokesman Jim McCarthy said he would look into the matter. He did not provide a comment for this article.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-03-08 11:03:49", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "la-oroya", "tags": "Renco Group, Doe Run Peru, Jim McCarthy, Anna Cederstav, Earthjustice, La Oroya, environment, pollution, Peru", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2303, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-03-08 14:39:26", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 25, "timestamp": "2011-03-07 16:28:22", "image": "", "title": "Current and former officials intervene on company\u2019s behalf in battle with Peru", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tBattling the government of Peru over an <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2011/la-oroya/\">inactive metal smelter</a> in one of the most polluted places on earth, billionaire Ira Rennert&rsquo;s Renco Group hired eight former government officials from five lobbying firms in a span of 82 days since November.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRenco signed up a former member of Congress, a former trade official, former congressional staffers and a campaign manager for a high-ranking Senate Republican to plead its case in Washington.

Donald Payne, D-N.J., <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/lobbying/firm/monument-strategies/DE46C6C9-03CC-4718-B954-7EF92E5494E0\">registered</a> to lobby for Renco Group, the New Jersey representative entered the <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov:80/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-02-11/pdf/CREC-2011-02-11-pt1-PgE215-3.pdf#page=1\">text of a letter</a> into the Congressional Record that he&rsquo;d sent a few days before to two cabinet officials, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, expressing his &ldquo;serious concern&rdquo; about Peru&rsquo;s treatment of the company.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFour days later, on February 15, Marisa Lago, the Assistant Treasury Secretary for International Markets and Development, wrote to Payne that, &ldquo;Our embassy has been in touch with the Government of Peru on a number of different occasions with respect to this case, emphasizing that we expect it to make a good faith effort to work with DRP to resolve the pending financial and environmental issues.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd Payne&#39;s current chief of staff, LaVerne Alexander, told Sunlight that, &quot;Secretary Geithner has indicated that they have approached the Peruvian government about the issue.&quot; She did not answer questions about how Payne developed an interest in Doe Run Peru.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMcKenney works for Monument Strategies, a bipartisan firm that <a href=\"http://www.monument-strategies.com/about_team.html\">counts</a> Alabama law and lobby shop Jones Walker as a strategic partner. Palmer C. Hamilton, a Jones Walker partner who <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/lobbying/firm/jones-walker-et-al/4C2873BD-E614-4207-8392-4A3D8E3374AB\">registered</a> to lobby for Renco Group on Nov. 11, 2010, is <a href=\"http://www.monument-strategies.com/about_team.html\">of counsel</a> to Monument.

Richard Shelby&rsquo;s, R-Ala., 1992 campaign and is a consistent donor to Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, having given him $18,000 over the last 16 years. Like Payne, Bachus wrote a letter&mdash;on Jan. 25&mdash;to the Treasury Department on behalf of Renco Group.

Bachus&#39;s staff declined to comment on this article.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the United States, Renco Group has made a fortune for its owner, Ira Rennert, who built his empire with <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/10/billionaires-2010_Ira-Rennert_M9N4.html\">junk bonds</a> and built himself the largest home in the country, a vast waterfront mansion in the Hamptons dubbed <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/04/nyregion/at-home-in-versailles-on-the-atlantic.html\">Fair Field</a>. More than 3,600 miles away, a Renco Group subsidiary owns a smelter that has contributed to the environmental devastation of the town of La Oroya, Peru, making it one of the <a href=\"http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/wwpp2007/finalReport2007.pdf\">world&rsquo;s ten most</a> polluted places according to the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CBoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blacksmithinstitute.org%2F&amp;ei=l1J1TcnFFcK78gbGzZi7Ag&amp;usg=AFQjCNFNCe8oX73kw3a0jiP7Tb3x94UtMg&amp;sig2=2l0XYRB7pkLLxRNgKKuvTQ\">Blacksmith Institute</a>, which studies pollution in the developing world.

Doe Run Peru has requested&mdash;and received&mdash;several extensions for completing the clean up work. All of that came to a standstill when Doe Run Peru <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/06/metals-peru-doerun-idUSN0614864020100106\">suspended operations</a> in 2009 due to a slowdown in the world economy and a failure to secure financing for the plant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn July 27, Peru&rsquo;s Ministry for Mining and Metals <a href=\"http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=52311\">revoked</a> the company&rsquo;s permit for operating, citing the lack of financing. Indecopi, the Peruvian government agency that regulates competition and oversees the bankruptcy process, began considering whether to restructure Doe Run Peru or to liquidate it to pay off creditors; it has yet to reach a decision on the company&rsquo;s fate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn late December 2010, Renco <a href=\"http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/RencoGroupVPeru_NOI.pdf\">filed its intent</a> to begin international arbitration against Peru, arguing that Lima is violating the <a href=\"http://www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/peru-tpa\">United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement</a> by discriminating unfairly against a U.S. company and that Lima has broken an investment contract.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn between losing its permit and filing for arbitration, the Renco Group started acquiring its Washington lobbying team. On Nov. 9, 2010, Timothy Keeler of Mayer Brown LLP <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/lobbying/firm/mayer-brown-llp/D2D575D8-911D-4518-9D42-40FBFA911083\">registered to lobby</a> for Renco Group. As the chief of staff of the office of the United States Trade Representative from <a href=\"http://ustraderep.gov/Document_Library/Press_Releases/2006/June/USTR_Schwab_Announces_New_Chief_of_Staff.html\">2006 to 2009</a>, Keeler <a href=\"http://www.mayerbrown.com/news/article.asp?id=6215&amp;nid=19\">oversaw</a> implementation of all U.S. trade agreements, according Mayer Brown&rsquo;s website, including the U.S.-Peru pact, which was approved by Congress on his watch. Mayer Brown&rsquo;s most recent <a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=01DFA57E-37E0-4692-A5CB-F7FA7DE65CAE\">lobbying disclosure</a> says that Keeler is lobbying his former agency and Congress to negotiate with Peru over its &ldquo;legal obligations and acknowledgement of full liability of injury claims.&rdquo; In response to an interview request from Sunlight, he wrote in an email that he could not comment on his lobbying for Renco.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSix days after hiring Keeler, the Renco Group added Capitol Counsel, a firm that includes former Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jim McCrery, R-La., among its professionals. As ranking member after Republicans lost their majority in the 2006 elections, McCrery <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/21/AR2007112102333.html\">played a key role</a> in moving the Peru trade agreement through Ways and Means.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRenco&rsquo;s Capitol Counsel team also includes the shop&rsquo;s founder John Raffaelli, one of <em>Washingtonian Magazine&rsquo;s</em> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonian.com/print/articles/6/171/4264.html\">50 top lobbyists</a> in 2007 and a former international trade counsel to the late Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and Shannon Finley, who recently worked for eight years as a <a href=\"http://www.capitolcounsel.com/bios/shannon_finley.htm\">political advisor</a> to Max Baucus, D-Mont., who as Senate Finance Committee chairman, is perhaps the most powerful <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/02/AR2011020204751.html\">gatekeeper</a> of trade deals in Congress.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRaffaelli and Finley have helped direct campaign dollars to powerful Senate Democrats.

Hamilton on Nov. 11; in the fourth quarter of 2010, Jones Walker reported receiving $110,000 from Renco, more than it reported for any other client. In 2011, two firms, Monument Strategies and Royer and Brooks, registered as lobbyists for Renco, including&nbsp;Rep. Payne&rsquo;s former chief of staff,&nbsp;adding three more former congressional staffers to Renco&rsquo;s influence team.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRennert and Renco Group are no strangers to finding the right man for the job in Washington. Lobbyists for AM General, the maker of Humvees used in Iraq and Afghanistan which is now jointly owned by Renco and another holding company, McAndrews and Forbes, reported spending nearly a half million dollars lobbying Congress <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/client_reports.php?year=2010&amp;lname=Renco+Group&amp;id=\">last year</a> on Pentagon spending bills; Jim Saxton, a former Republican House member who served on the House Armed Services Committee, which authorizes appropriations for the Pentagon, is one of AM General&rsquo;s lobbyists.

In a 1998 report, the Environmental Protection Agency ranked Renco Group as the <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_07/b3820069_mz020.htm\">country&rsquo;s 10th&nbsp;largest polluter</a>, largely for the magnesium site in Utah, which was designated as a Superfund area despite the <a href=\"file:///\\\\SUN\\Users\\sunlightuser3\\My%20Documents\\Downloads\\home\">company&rsquo;s court challenges</a>. The Environmental Protection Agency sued MagCorp for almost $1 billion in fines in 2001 over its production of hexachlorobenzene, a chemical ruled a poison decades ago, a suit which the magnesium company has <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/50125909-76/magnesium-waste-epa-law.html.csp\">fought </a>&nbsp;over the past decade, arguing that it is exempt from a hazardous waste law. Another subsidiary, the St. Louis-based <a href=\"http://www.doerun.com/ABOUTUS/tabid/56/language/en-US/Default.aspx\">Doe Run Company</a>, also has a long record of battles with the EPA, and in 2010 agreed to spend&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/article_218ea7e8-d306-11df-ab5a-00127992bc8b.html\">$65 million</a>&nbsp;plus a $7 million civil penalty for violations of environmental regulations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn its bid to hold onto its Peruvian subsidiary, the Renco Group recently <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/doe-run-peru-announces-renco-group-loan-offer-to-expedite-cleanup-of-la-oroya-116853168.html\">announced</a> it would loan the company up to $50 million to help clean up La Oroya.

Open government groups&mdash;<a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2010/08/03/dodd-and-frank-asked-to-repeal-finreg-foia-exemption/\">including</a> the Sunlight Foundation&mdash;joined in the cry to overturn this part of the Dodd-Frank law, which also appeared to protect the SEC from third-party civil lawsuits requesting information.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, Congress did not touch this other FOIA exemption, which says that &ldquo;information, reports, documents, records, or information,&rdquo; collected by financial agencies in their capacity of overseeing these investment advisers is exempt from FOIA.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;We were not able to get any traction on [section 404],&rdquo; says Angela Canterbury, director of Public Policy for the Project on Government Oversight (POGO). In her <a href=\"http://www.pogo.org/pogo-files/testimony/financial-oversight/fo-fra-20100916.html\">testimony</a> before the House Financial Services Committee last September, Canterbury had called on Congress to repeal section 404.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tShe added that section 404 also might provide a similar way for agencies to avoid information requests as part of third-party lawsuits, and noted that the law failed to specify that section 404 was meant to be a so-called &ldquo;b(3)&rdquo; exemption. Exemption 3 under the FOIA law permits agencies to withhold information that is specifically exempted by statute. Since the passage of the 2009 <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s612/show\">OPEN FOIA Act</a>, however, Congress is required to explicitly state its intention to provide such an exemption&mdash;which it does not do in section 404.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCanterbury and other FOIA experts contacted say it is difficult to determine how severely section 404 will restrict the public&rsquo;s access to information, although they all agree that as written it does not seem as expansive as the other controversial section that Congress repealed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBob Gellman, who <a href=\"http://www.bobgellman.com/index.html\">advises</a> corporations and government agencies about personal privacy policies, says that the type of information described by section 404 may well be covered by existing FOIA exemptions, such as exemption 4, which allows agencies to withhold &ldquo;proprietary information,&rdquo; or trade secrets from disclosure under FOIA.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnother long-standing exemption under the open information law says that any information collected in the oversight of financial institutions does not need to be disclosed. Traditionally, this exemption applied to examinations of federally insured banks, for fear that disclosure of such information would cause a run on a bank. However, in the courts have <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_guide09/exemption8.pdf\">interpreted</a> this exemption broadly to include other financial institutions, not just banks. Indeed, in repealing section 929l of the Dodd-Frank law, Congress <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s3717/text?version=enr&amp;nid=t0:enr:18\">specified</a> that entities overseen by the SEC qualify as financial institutions under FOIA.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNot all are sanguine about the legitimacy of using this section 8 exemption under FOIA to withhold information about financial institution examinations. In her testimony, Canterbury pointed out that the SEC had invoked this exemption to redact the name of a particular examinations program mentioned in a report by the agency&rsquo;s inspector general. The SEC Office of Inspector General had found that the agency&rsquo;s Fort Worth Regional Office had retaliated against employees who had raised concerns about this program, arguing that it would divert staff attention away from serious fraud and force them to concentrate on superficial enforcement. These employees had also raised flags about alleged fraud by Stanford.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd in 1995, in the wake of the savings &amp; loan crisis, the Administrative Conference of the United States <a href=\"http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/admin/acus/305951.html\">noted</a> that exemption 8 &ldquo;provides an unusual level of protection to banks and bank regulatory agencies&hellip;The upheaval faced by financial institutions in the last decade and the number of such institutions that have failed makes availability of information relating to the regulation of that segment of the economy of particular interest. A substantial amount of taxpayer money has been spent to alleviate problems relating to financial institutions.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGellman, who had a long career as a staffer on Capitol Hill specializing in privacy matters, said often these exemptions make it into law because staffers don&rsquo;t necessarily understand how FOIA works. &ldquo;Industry screams and objects, well we want some kind of protection for the data, so we&rsquo;ll give you what you want, and you get a provision [like this] a lot of times sail on through.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIndeed, in recent years Congress has included FOIA exemptions in a long list of laws, from information about chemical facility security to animal identification systems to food safety to infrastructure protection, <a href=\"http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA529711\">according</a> to the Congressional Research Service.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-02-14 12:20:11", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "\u201cIndustry screams and objects, well we want some kind of protection for the data, so we\u2019ll give you what you want, and you get a provision [like this] a lot of times sail on through.\u201d", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "overlooked-part-dodd-frank-law-could-keep-information-public", "tags": "Finance Data Catalog, FOIA, financial, data mine, freedom of information act, investment advisers", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2292, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-02-11 17:41:13", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2011-02-11 17:26:13", "image": "", "title": "Lobby of love: Firms in the Valentine's Day trade have multiple interests in Washington", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tTo most, Valentine&#39;s Day is all about giving flowers and candy, perhaps sipping champagne, shopping for a sexy outfit or sending a greeting card, but for businesses providing those goods, it&#39;s a money making venture.

For the greeting card industry--including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://influenceexplorer.com/organization/hallmark-cards/020876fa250849e1a6622c07f48c3563\">Hallmark Cards</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://influenceexplorer.com/organization/american-greetings-corp/b6de6effa33d41519273c764f0f8ed4b\">American Greetings Corp.</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Greeting+Card+Assn&amp;year=2010\">Greeting Card Association</a>, which represents Hallmark, American Greetings and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.greetingcard.org/AbouttheGCA/MemberListing/tabid/107/Default.aspx\">136 other members</a>&nbsp;that manufacture pre-packaged sentiments, keeping the <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/09/news/economy/postal_service/index.htm?hpt=T2\">financially troubled</a> U.S. Post Office afloat is a top issue. Greeting card manufacturers pushed for everything from the &quot;forever&quot; stamp--the first class stamp that never requires additional postage, even when rates go up--to the preservation of Saturday delivery, which USPS would like to end in a cost-cutting move. Don Hall Jr., Hallmark&#39;s president and CEO,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/Hearings/pdfs/20100623Hall.pdf\">testified</a> before the&nbsp;House Government Oversight and Reform Committee on June 23, 2010, that, rather than cut service or raise prices, the way to balance the Post Office&#39;s books was to raid the fund USPS pays into to fund retirees future health expenses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://influenceexplorer.com/organization/limited-brands/14bbabc95d6c49a6aa23cb8032e11e96\">Limited Brands</a>, which owns lingerie retailer Victoria&#39;s Secret and the home and beauty products chain Bath and Body Works has been a formidable force in Washington, with reported spending on lobbying averaging more than $750,000 over the last dozen years. The firm&#39;s in-house and outside lobbyists consistently listed foreign trade deals and trade pacts as issues, and until the end of 2010 included former chief of staff for the U.S. Trade Representative&#39;s office, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=71390\">Robert D. Lehman</a>&nbsp;of Squire Saunders &amp; Dempsey. The pursuit of retailers like Limited Brands for cheaper sources of apparel is one of the factors that have devastated employment at U.S. factories; in 1990, there were more than 900,000 employed in apparel manufacturing in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics; by 2010, that had fallen to less than 160,000. Apparel retailers increased their employment by just 63,000 jobs over the same period.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://influenceexplorer.com/organization/personal-care-products-council/8b8650ba0c3f447296c9d0719e72aeb8\">Personal Care Products Council</a>, formerly known as the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association battled an <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-5786&amp;tab=summary\">effort</a> in the 111th Congress to regulate the cosmetics industry by making perfumeries, lipstick makers and other cosmetic suppliers list their ingredients, have the Food and Drug Administration track adverse events as it does for medicines, and require an alternative way of gauging the safety of cosmetics than testing on animals. The council argued that the bill would &quot;create a mammoth new regulatory structure for cosmetics&quot; that would overwhelm the FDA, and offered <a href=\"http://www.personalcarecouncil.org/newsroom/20100721a\">its own plan</a>.&nbsp;Lezlee Westine, president and CEO of the council, noted &quot;our industry has lobbied for the last several years to obtain additional funding for FDA&rsquo;s Office of Cosmetics and Colors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://influenceexplorer.com/organization/wine-spirits-wholesalers-of-america/75d61655822e47778401453ff29ff4a7\">Wine &amp; Spirits Wholesalers of America</a> spent most of last year trying to make sure its members remain middlemen whenever a bottle of bubbly or components of a Valentine&#39;s Day martini are sold by <a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=99a23b0c-5c0a-4b42-ac24-c52c3b323c41\">pushing</a> the C<a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-5034\">omprehensive Alcohol Regulatory Effectiveness Act</a>, which would make keep Federal courts out of cases pitting alcohol distributors--a relic of the post-prohibition effort to get organized crime out of the liquor business--against retailers seeking to bypass them and offer consumers more choice and lower prices.

The current proposal would reduce the fees paid by merchants to banks to a maximum of 12 cents per transaction. In 2009, the average cost charged to merchants per transaction was 44 cents. While a win for retailers, the new cap could result in a 70 percent decrease in profits for big banks. Smaller banks, like those represented by the ABA, are exempt from the regulation. They warn that retailers will favor big banks, which charge lower fees, over small banks.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn amendment, sponsored by Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act gave the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20101216a.htm\">Federal Reserve</a> the power to cap the fees, known as interchange fees, that issuers of debit and credit cards charge to retailers for every transaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBig banks, which oppose the measure, have said that in order to recoup the lost revenue from interchange fees they might have to charge customers in other ways, such as placing fees on checking accounts or charging annual fees in order to hold debit cards.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEd Meirzwinski of <a href=\"http://www.uspirg.org/consumer-blog/consumer-blog/fed-proposes-surprisingly-strong-debit-card-swipe-fee-rules\">U.S. PIRG</a>, an advocacy group that lobbied on the Dodd Frank bill, thinks it will ultimately benefit consumers. According to Meirzwinski, the Durbin amendment &quot;is an answer to a broken marketplace.&quot; He believes that merchants will ultimately pass savings from lower interchange fees on to their customers in the form of lower prices in an effort to beat out competition. &quot;Merchant business is competitive, bank business is not,&quot; Meirzwinski said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLast year, after House approved the amendment, a lobbyist for the Retail Industry Leaders Association told the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/business/15credit.html\">New York Times</a>&nbsp;that the issue is, &quot;really a decision between helping out small business or helping out large banks.&quot;&nbsp;The Retail Industry Leaders Association reported<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Retail+Industry+Leaders+Assn&amp;year=2010\">&nbsp;spending $1.9 million</a>&nbsp;in 2010 lobbying on issues that include interchange fees. Large retailers that also included interchange fees among the issues they lobbied on also disclosed spending lots of money influencing Washington.<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Apple+Inc&amp;year=2010\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lookup.php?type=c&amp;lname=apple&amp;goButt2.x=0&amp;goButt2.y=0&amp;goButt2=Submit\">Apple, Inc</a><a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Apple+Inc&amp;year=2010\">.</a>&nbsp;reported spending $1.6 million on lobbying;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=CVS/Caremark+Corp&amp;year=2010\">CVS Caremark</a>, the nationwide pharmacy and convenience story operator,&nbsp;reported $8.9 million in spending; and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Starbucks+Corp&amp;year=2010\">Starbucks</a>, the ubiquitous coffee store operator,&nbsp;reported $730,000.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause small banks are exempt from the provision, they may continue to charge what they were charging before Dodd-Frank. And based on what small banks have reported as the actual cost they bear for offering debit cards&mdash;31 cents per transaction, according to one&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/SECRS/2011/January/20110110/R-1404/R-1404_010711_59930_597184920010_1.pdf\">Iowa bank</a>&mdash;lowering fees could endanger their business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFurther, Peter Garuccio, a spokesman for the ABA, said the Durbin amendment might end up providing an incentive for retailers to entice customers to use the big banks through promotions. This could ultimately void the benefit the small bank exemption was supposed to provide.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMeirzwinski said any enticement to encourage discrimination against small banks by large retailers would be severely frowned upon by Congress. He thinks that something like that might warrant more action by the government.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to OpenSecrets.org,<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/indusclient.php?lname=F03&amp;year=2010\"> the ABA was the top political contributor</a> among commercial banks in 2010 at $2.8 million, and spent $7.4 million lobbying -- the most among commercial banks.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBank of America, a big bank that will be affected by the new regulations, has also submitted an analysis to the Federal Reserve counseling the agency on how it should move forward. The bank reported <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000090\">spending $2.8 million</a> on lobbying in 2010.

Spencer Bachus</a>, R-Ala., now the chairman for the House Committee on Financial Services, which is holding next week&rsquo;s hearing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCredit card companies such as Mastercard will also be affected by the new regulations because of a provision in the amendment that mandates changes in the way payments are routed, something that Mastercard and Visa handle. Mastercard <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=MasterCard+Inc&amp;year=2010\">reported spending</a> more than $4 million dollars lobbying Congress last year on issues including interchange fees and they have submitted comments to the Fed to shape the final rule.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-02-11 11:07:08", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "banking-industry-says-and-spends-lots-keep-interchange-fees-same", "tags": "Dodd-frank, Financial reform, Bank of America, Mastercard, american bankers association, opengov, Apple, Starbucks", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2290, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-02-09 13:39:28", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 3, "timestamp": "2011-02-09 11:52:33", "image": "", "title": "Business community has its guns aimed at the environment, financial reforms", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tIn a bid to roll back laws and regulations, some passed and some proposed, in the last two years, business conglomerates have targeted a handful of federal agencies -- with the Environmental Protection Agency receiving the bulk of the attention -- in reply to a request by Rep.

Rulemaking by a few other agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the barely established Consumer Finance Security Board that was created by the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill and the Department of Agriculture and Transportation Security Agency are also targeted, the document release shows.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Reporting Group has uploaded the responses released earlier in the week by the committee to Document Cloud; they can be accessed <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/32168-reg-responses-reduced.html\">here.</a> Most of the documents are letters to Issa from several dozen business associations and in some cases individual companies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chamber of Commerce, the venue for President Obama&rsquo;s speech earlier this week imploring the business community to get on board with his administrations priorities, criticizes his administration in one response, writing that the administration &ldquo;has largely spent the past 24 months attempting to modify, re-issue, or reinterpret virtually every controversial environmental regulatory decision of the past decade.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chamber one of the most prolific lobbying group in the last 12 years--it&#39;s disclosed spending more than<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?indexType=s\"> $700 million</a> on lobbying over that time--<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/32168-reg-responses-reduced.html\">chastised</a><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/32168-reg-responses-reduced.html#document/p837\"> </a>the &ldquo;strict compliance&rdquo; forced on the industry by congressional directive or court order with little regard to the impact on the community. The letter specifically talks about the Chesapeake Bay storm water runoff and the Boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology rule change proposed by the EPA in April 2010. Recently, the EPA&rsquo;s request for extending the comment period was denied by a court order forcing the agency to propose new rules in the next few months on industrial and commercial boilers. The new rules also calls for better monitoring of the emissions.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Chamber also provides the committee with a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/32168-reg-responses-reduced.html#document/p842\">&ldquo;how to fix the problem&rdquo;</a> section, arguing that there are several good ideas circulating in Congress to fix the &quot;regulatory tsunami&quot; businesses are facing and are calling on the Issa&#39;s committee and regulatory agencies such as the EPA to consider job losses and economic impact of the enforcement of the regulations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/32168-reg-responses-reduced.html#document/p875\">The Council of Industrial Boiler Owners</a> also commented on the boiler rules, saying the new regulation will increase costs and for every billion spent on upgrade it may reduce the U.S. GDP by about $1.2 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSimilarly, the American Forest and Paper Association says Boiler MACT could impose $6 billion in costs and an additional $20 billion on manufacturers leading to a high loss in jobs caused due to mill closures, while the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/32168-reg-responses-reduced.html#document/p108\">American Chemistry Council </a>submitted research studies&nbsp; showing how their industry could lose up to 60,000 jobs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Chemistry Council in 2010 has spent more than<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=American+Chemistry+Council&amp;year=2010\"> $8 million in lobbying</a> Congress and federal agencies. Other EPA laws targeted by the industry are the Clean Air and Clean Water acts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Dodd-Frank financial reform was another law that was repeatedly cited across the documents. According to documents submitted by the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/32168-reg-responses-reduced.html#document/p928\">Credit Union Advocacy Organization</a>, which represents 90 percent of the federal credit unions, changes in the regulation in bank card fees will force financial institutions to find other ways to cover costs and will &ldquo;absolutely hit the pocketbooks of Americans holding debit cards.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/32168-reg-responses-reduced.html#document/p715\">American Petroleum Institute</a> picked on Section 1504 of the financial bill, a transparency provision, which requires companies registered with the SEC to report all payments made to the federal or any foreign government if it relates to the commercial development of oil and gas. But API&rsquo;s claim is that this provision goes against internationally set rules, and places U.S. companies at a disadvantage, jeopardizing jobs in the bargain.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe other major issue cited in the letters is health care, spearheaded by the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council. They are asking for the repeal of the individual mandate, which requires citizens to purchase health insurance or face a financial penalty and the 1099 reporting provision, which requires businesses to file forms with the Internal Revenue Service for every transaction they make with a supplier or servicer of $600 or more. According to their letter, the 1099 requirement imposes a &ldquo;paperwork nightmare on America&rsquo;s small businesses.&rdquo; They also call for the repeal of the employer mandate, which pushes employers to provide health care, implementation that could lead to heavy overhead costs and job losses, according to the Council.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-02-09 12:51:53", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "business-community-has-its-guns-aimed-environment-financial-refo", "tags": "EPA, Issa, agency regulation, Dodd-Frank", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2287, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-02-07 14:39:31", "override_byline": "Keenan Steiner and Anupama Narayanswamy", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 3, "timestamp": "2011-02-04 01:47:30", "image": "", "title": "OCE report on financial reform shows nexus between fundraising and legislating", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tOn Nov. 24, 2009, Sara Conrad, the fundraising consultant for Rep.

The email was a follow-up to a prior conversation he had with Crowley&rsquo;s chief of staff, Kate Winkler, about the Ways and Means Committee member&#39;s upcoming campaign events.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAround the same time, Conrad, who worked for Crowley&#39;s campaign and not his congressional office, sent several other <a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html#document/p323\">emails</a>, including similar notes to lobbyists for <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=6385\">Time Warner</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=75703\">Mortgage Bankers Association</a>; like Stein, both were registered to lobby on the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Bill (H.R. 4173), the biggest overhaul of the nation&#39;s investment and banking rules since the Glass-Steagall Act was passed in 1933. Winkler, who worked in Crowley&#39;s congressional office and draws a salary from taxpayers, sent an <a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html\">invite</a> directly to a lobbyist for Zurich insurance.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA little more than two weeks later, a day before the House would pass Dodd-Frank, the Time Warner and <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=74239\">Zurich</a> lobbyists, a lobbyist from Morgan Stanley and a Mortgage Bankers Association lobbyist were on the attendance list for the Dec. 10 fundraiser and campaign finance disclosures from the Federal Election Commission show that the PACs for all four firms each contributed $1000 to Crowley&#39;s campaign.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>The Reporting Group has annotated the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html\">House Ethics Committee report</a> with research and links to data using Document Cloud, a tool that allows users to make documents more accessible. This story summarizes some of the findings from the Office of Congressional Ethics, showing the nexus between public acts and private interests that exists in Washington fundraising practices.</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCommunication between Stein and Crowley&#39;s office continued after the fundraising invitation was sent. On Dec. 3,&nbsp;2009, a day after the financial reform bill was introduced in the House and referred to several committees for amendment, Stein wrote an <a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html#document/p320\">email </a>to Winkler complaining about the &ldquo;anticompetitive&rdquo; and &ldquo;market stifling&rdquo; Lynch amendment in the bill. Winkler responded that her boss is working on the issue and forwarded the email along to Crowley&rsquo;s chief legislative aide for financial services. A week later Crowley <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HZ521:\">voted</a> against the amendment, on the same evening of the <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/party/18512/\">fundraising reception</a>.&nbsp;Winkler and the legislative aide both attended the event, according to the report issued by the House Committee on Ethics last week.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe ethics committee report cleared Crowley, chair of the New Democrat Coalition and chief deputy whip and two other lawmakers, Reps.Tom Price, R-Ga., and John Campbell, R-Calif., both of whom sit on the Financial Services Committee, of appearing to grant special access to Wall Street donors. In doing so, it <a href=\"http://blog.politicalpartytime.org/2011/01/27/house-ethics-committee-rejects-independent-bodys-findings-on-3-lawmakers/\">disagreed</a> with the findings of the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, which opened the investigation last May, and recommended the cases to the Ethics Committee for further consideration in September.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Here&#39;s a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-bgOj-jnk7mvSr4W58tROutRvdnphE9NQ8bLEhbZX8k/edit?hl=en\">list </a>of the fundraisers examined in the ethics report.</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen it announced it would not take further action, the Ethics Committee noted that each member hired outside fundraising consultants. The committee saw a <a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html#document/p23\">&ldquo;strict separation&rdquo;</a> between the fundraising and official staffers and also cleared the lawmakers because the <a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html#document/p28\">events were open</a> to others outside of the financial industry.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, as in the case of Crowley, emails uncovered by the Office of Congressional Ethics reveal that the separation was not so strict. Official staff were informed weeks in advance about many lobbyists&rsquo; interest in donating.&nbsp;For instance, Gregg Sheiowitz of Zurich insurance, who before becoming a lobbyist had served as Crowley&rsquo;s legislative director, sent&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html#document/p320\">email</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;both Winkler, who worked for Crowley&#39;s official office, and Conrad, who was paid by the campaign, telling them he would attend back in November. By that time, members knew that a vote on H.R. 4173 would come up in December, according to the OCE&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html#document/p261\">interview</a> with House Financial Services Committee chairman Barney Frank, D-Mass.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor each of these events, the members and their chiefs of staff were given attendance lists which <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html#document/p94\">in some cases</a> detailed how big of a check each attendee had committed to give. The fundraising consultants handed over <a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html#document/p320\">the lists</a> either the day of or the day before the event. Crowley&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html#document/p225\">two Dec. 10</a> fundraisers would bring in $90,000, emails exchanges between his consultant and his congressional staff reveal.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><a href=\"http://ethics.house.gov/Media/PDF/2008_House_Ethics_Manual.pdf\">Ethics rules</a>&nbsp;say that while a staff member is working on legislation supported by a corporation, and for a period thereafter, the aide should not solicit contributions from that corporation. The Ethics Committee saw nothing improper in the email traffic.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>The timing of fundraisers was &lsquo;happenstance&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Ethics Committee wrote that the timing of floor action related to the bill was uncertain and concluded that fundraisers coinciding with the amending of and voting on H.R. 4173 was<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html\"> &ldquo;happenstance.&rdquo;</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNot everyone agreed--even those attending fundraisers weeks before the bill was formally introduced. At an Oct. 21 John Campbell fundraising event, just before a committee markup on the overhaul bill, 16 of 17 <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html#document/p94\">attendees</a>&nbsp;were registered to lobby on the bill. This timing was enough to raise the eyebrows of one lobbyist, Scott McLucas of KPMG, who wrote in an <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html#document/p95\">internal email</a>: &ldquo;[i]s it wrong for me to reply and say that&rsquo;s not such a good night given we have this crucial piece of legislation being marked up the next day?&rdquo; McLucas was on the attendance list for the event, and his PAC contributed $2,500 to Campbell.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTiming, which McLucas raised in his email, was an important factor in the OCE&rsquo;s overall investigation and findings, the report shows. The <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html#document/p352\">OCE considered</a> the House ethics rules, which say though it is acceptable for campaign managers to solicit contributions from people who have gotten favors, members should allow &ldquo;a decent interval of time to lapse&rdquo; after the official action to avoid the appearance of impropriety. For some lawmakers working on the financial reform bill, a few hours were sufficient to provide a &quot;decent&quot; interval. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn Dec. 9, the day before voting on amendments to the bill took place, a member of Crowley&rsquo;s staff broke good news to a group of lobbyists <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html#document/p220\">over email</a> and included Winkler on the email. The staff member, <a href=\"http://dyn.politico.com/printpros.cfm?uuid=B049BF09-18FE-70B2-A8C4507D9F6461E5\">Adam Pase</a>, executive director of the New Democrats Coalition, chaired by Crowley, wrote that amendments proposed by moderate Democrats, many of which were to the liking of the financial industry, would receive a vote in the House, thanks to Crowley&#39;s negotiations with leadership. Shanti Stanton of Elmendorf Strategies, whose clients include Time Warner, Verizon, Ernst &amp; Young, all of whom were on the list for the Crowley reception on Dec. 10, was one of the recipients of the email.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter that reception, Crowley and his two top staffers attended a dinner for his leadership PAC, which began at 7 p.m. At the same time, the House was debating the merits of Lynch amendment, which would have prevented any one bank from owning more than 20 percent of derivatives&rsquo; clearinghouses. The measure was opposed by big banks.&nbsp;Price, a Republican member of the Financial Services Committee, took to<a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/videoLibrary/clip.php?appid=595067059\">&nbsp;the floor</a>&nbsp;to argue against the amendment because &ldquo;the people who know about the issue of trading in these areas&rdquo; were opposed to it. He cited the opposition of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), the American Bankers Assocation Securities Association and NYSE EuroNext.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat afternoon, a few hours before Price argued against the Lynch amendment, lobbyists from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lobbyist.php?lname=Hill,%20Edward%20Jeffrey&amp;id=Y00000070500&amp;year=2010\">Bank of America</a> and <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=73968\">Morgan Stanley</a>, two of the five banks that control most of the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a1561c2HgMiU\">over-the-counter derivatives </a>market, attended Price&#39;s &ldquo;Financial Services Industry&rdquo; luncheon; the banks&#39; PACs contributed $1,000 around that time. Bank associations, including the <a href=\"http://www.ici.org/about_ici/leadership/09_bog_list\">Investment Company Institute</a> and the<a href=\"http://www.fsround.org/about/member_companies.htm\"> Financial Services Roundtable</a>&nbsp;also attended. A SIFMA lobbyist was on the<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html\"> attendance list</a> but did not attend, according to the report.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLater that evening, the amendment passed despite the votes of Crowley, Price and Campbell.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Thousands were invited, so there&rsquo;s nothing to see here</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Ethics Committee also cleared members who held fundraising events for financial industry lobbyists while Congress considered the financial reform bill because the events were open to a broad list of people. Invitations were sometimes sent as &ldquo;blast&rdquo; emails to as many as 5,000 people and were planned months ahead.&nbsp;However, those who showed up were interested in financial reform.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd some members had their staffs make sure that word got out to lobbyists for banking interests. For Rep. Tom Price&rsquo;s Dec.10 lunch, his <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html\">fundraising consultant asked </a>Bank of America lobbyist Ed Hill and Properties Casualty Insurers Association of America&#39;s Paul Kangas to round up other companies&rsquo; representatives, specifically mentioning Morgan Stanley. 13 of the 16 actual attendees were registered to lobby on the bill, the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html\">OCE wrote</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29636-wall-street-bill-report.html\">According to the OCE</a>, 31 of the 42 people expected to attend Crowley&rsquo;s 5 p.m. holiday reception were either registered to lobby on the bill or represented groups that did, as was all but one of the attendees at Campbell&rsquo;s October dinner.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNevertheless, the Ethics Committee concluded that &quot;each Member&#39;s fundraising activities raised no appearances of impropriety.&quot;</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-02-07 14:41:43", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "oce-report", "tags": "OCE, Campbell, Crowley, Price, Party time, fundraising, lobbying", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2284, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-02-08 18:31:47", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 22, "timestamp": "2011-02-02 10:06:29", "image": "", "title": "Conflict minerals comment period delayed under corporate and congressional pressure", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tAfter a powerful committee chairman and several corporate interests wrote to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting an extension of the comment period for the agency&rsquo;s proposed regulations requiring that companies disclose when they use &ldquo;conflict minerals,&rdquo; the agency granted the request.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe new regulations are mandated under a little-noticed provision in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act calling for companies using conflict minerals to disclose whether they were mined by rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) or neighboring countries, where metals such as gold are mined under inhumane conditions and fund war crimes. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/text?version=enr&amp;nid=t0:enr:13839\" target=\"_blank\">mining provisions in the Dodd Frank bill</a>&nbsp;also require that companies determine and disclose a &quot;chain of custody&quot; for such minerals, to trace where they originated, because they fund rebels in DRC and neighboring countries.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHouse Financial Services Committee Chairman Spencer Bachus, R., Ala., <a href=\"http://sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010-60.pdf\">wrote</a> the agency on January 25, saying that &ldquo;to provide appropriate responses, issuers must consult with a variety of effected (sic.) parties to determine the impact on their operations.&rdquo; He asked for a 30-day extension of the comment period, which was scheduled to end on January 31. The new comment period, announced three days after the agency received Bachus&#39; letter, is extended through March 2.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA group of 16 powerful trade associations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation, and the National Association of Manufacturers, also <a href=\"http://sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010-27.pdf\">asked</a> for an extension in a December letter to the agency.

Many groups, individuals and some corporate interests submitted comments during the original time period, including the New York City American Bar Association&#39;s <a href=\"http://sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010-58.pdf\">Human Rights Committee</a> and <a href=\"http://sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010-45.pdf\">TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne of the most outspoken advocates for conflict-free minerals is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.raisehopeforcongo.org/content/conflict-minerals-company-rankings\" target=\"_blank\">Enough</a>, a campaign by the Center for American Progress. In the past two years, Center for American Progress has reported spending <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Center+for+American+Progress++++++++++++&amp;year=2010\" target=\"_blank\">$814,000</a>&nbsp;lobbying Congress on a long list of issues, from extending unemployment insurance benefits to the Child Nutrition Act, in addition to the issue of conflict minerals. Enough ranks companies on their commitment to making their products conflict free. Some companies using minerals in their products such as cell phones and computers are also working with Enough to stop the use of these minerals.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn Enough report lists 29 <a href=\"http://www.enoughproject.org/about/partners\">partners</a> in its conflict mineral campaign, including major players like Amnesty International, Save Darfur and UN Refugee Agency. Corporate participants include HP, Intel, Motorola, Nokia, Microsoft, and Dell. HP&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2010/100721b.html\" target=\"_blank\">vowed</a>&nbsp;to &ldquo;share our global supply chain best practices in order to promote change across all industries where conflict minerals are used.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSasha Lezhnev of the Enough campaign said, &ldquo;I am surprised, this is the first time people are paying more attention to the regulatory process than the legislation. Companies thought this bill would never pass.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA major force on the other side is the manufacturing industry conglomerate National Association of Manufactures (NAM). It lobbied both chambers of Congress on the conflict mineral issue during the last half of 2010. Lobbying reports show that NAM reported spending <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?year=2010&amp;lname=National+Assn+of+Manufacturers&amp;id=\">seven million </a>dollars on lobbying in 2010 on conflict minerals along with many other issues.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter the first round of Congressional lobbying, the lobbying focus shifted to the SEC. Between August and December of 2010, when the agency issued the proposed regulations, the agency held&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sec.gov/comments/df-title-xv/specialized-disclosures/specialized-disclosures.shtml#meetings\" target=\"_blank\">25</a>&nbsp;meetings about conflict mineral regulations. The SEC met with interests on both sides of the issue. Industry lobbyists sought meetings, but so did the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sec.gov/comments/df-title-xv/specialized-disclosures/specializeddisclosures-20.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">UN Group of Experts for the DRC</a>, <a href=\"http://sec.gov/comments/df-title-xv/specialized-disclosures/specializeddisclosures-53.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the Ministry of Mines of the Democratic Republic of Congo</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sec.gov/comments/df-title-xv/specialized-disclosures/specializeddisclosures-76.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Enough</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sec.gov/comments/df-title-xv/specialized-disclosures/specializeddisclosures-18.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Global Witness</a>. One&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sec.gov/comments/df-title-xv/specialized-disclosures/specializeddisclosures-77.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">meeting</a>&nbsp;included the industry giants: Retail Industry Leaders Association, Costco, Target, Best Buy, J.C. Penney, Wal-Mart, and Lowe&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne popular jewelry brand, Tiffany &amp; Co., is an opponent of these reforms. The company does not want gold to be listed as a conflict mineral, and, in its&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/comments/df-title-xv/specialized-disclosures/specializeddisclosures-17.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">letter to the SEC</a>, attests that it &ldquo;purchase[s] only recycled gold or gold produced by a single U.S. smelter from ore produced by a single U.S, mine.&rdquo; Tiffany would be affected by this regulation because it would have to prove the gold the company uses is not from conflict zones in DRC or surrounding countries. The company asserts that it is difficult to trace recycled gold and the use of components, such as spring closures, provided by other manufacturers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/comments/df-title-xv/specialized-disclosures/specializeddisclosures-69.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a>&nbsp;to the SEC, NAM reiterates Tiffany&rsquo;s stand and calls for an exemption for recycled or reclaimed minerals because of the difficulty of identifying the source of materials once they are refined. NAM met with officials at the SEC&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sec.gov/comments/df-title-xv/specialized-disclosures/specializeddisclosures-10.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">August 30</a>. The group argued that because the rebel groups only profit from raw mineral extraction and recycling minerals reduces demand for raw minerals, recycling is a good way to reduce the Rebel&rsquo;s mineral trade. Enough and other groups backing this provision insist that there are simple steps companies can take to ensure that exempting recycled minerals does not turn into a loophole.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNAM&rsquo;s policy wish list includes a flexible standard of &ldquo;due diligence.&rdquo; The group wants a minimalistic standard on how much research and tracking companies will be responsible for while Enough contests that there &ldquo;should be basic steps companies can take to achieve due diligence.&rdquo; HP and Intel have already proved tracing these minerals is possible.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDRC has been discussing the mining provisions in the Dodd Frank bill a few years now, <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/client/Office%20of%20the%20President%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Congo/\">Foreign Agents Registration Act filing</a> show.

The Center for Responsive Politics digitizes data from congressional financial disclosures, makes them searchable and readable--a <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/index.php\">good place to start</a>&nbsp;when digging into the assets members accumulate while in office (note also <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703871904575216491495135642.html\">this Wall Street Journal story</a>, on members betting the market would go down during the 2008 financial crisis, t<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703431604575522434188603198.html\">his Wall Street Journal story</a> on staffers getting into the act, and <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/dec2010/pi20101220_551107.htm\">this BusinessWeek story</a> noting a new study that found that members of Congress, overall, failed to beat the market. OpenSecrets.org also has data on <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/index.php\">lobbying</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/index.php\">revolving door</a>, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/index.php\">political action committees</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/index.php\">tons</a> of <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/index_stfed.php\">federal</a> campaign finance information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTracking foreign influence on Congress was also suggested--<a href=\"http://pajamasmedia.com/rogerlsimon/2011/01/04/pjm-transparency-project/#comment-360304\">here</a>. Sunlight digitizes thousands of pages of disclosures of meetings with members and Congress, their staffs, and executive branch officials as well as campaign contributions made by lobbyists for foreign governments, political parties and other entities required under the Foreign Agent Registration Act. All available at our <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org\">Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker</a>, which was just recently updated with 2009 data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis commenter suggests looking into nonprofits that get government grant dollars; <a href=\"http://usaspending.gov\">USASpending.gov</a> has some of that data; using the <a href=\"http://usaspending.gov/advanced-search\">advanced search function </a>(scroll down!) you can limit results by type of organization--with nonprofit being an option.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA few other useful tools (sorry, too many comments to go through one by one) that respond to some topics raised in other comments: <a href=\"http://transparencydata.com\">TransparencyData.com</a> has data on state and federal campaign contributions, federal lobbying, congressional and presidential earmarks, and federal contracts and grants. <a href=\"http://influenceexplorer.com\">InfluenceExplorer.com</a> is sort of the data equivalent of Readers Digest--quick and easy graphics and tables on who gives, who gets and who lobbies. <a href=\"http://www.poligraft.com\">Poligraft.com</a> is one of my favorites--run a news story or a press release through it and it picks out names of politicians and political contributors and finds cross-references, if any. Also, don&#39;t neglect to check the <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/WhiteHouseVisitors/\">White House visitor logs</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor those who are more activist minded, we have ongoing efforts targeted at making lobbyists disclose more information on their activities (read more <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/lobbying/\">here</a>) and a transparency agenda (read more <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/documents/agenda/\">here</a>).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI came across the Pajamas effort via <a href=\"http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/112552/\">InstaPundit.</a></p>\r\n", "date_published": "2011-01-05 09:01:02", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "some-suggestions-pajamas-medias-transparency-project", "tags": "Pajamas Media, tools", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2275, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-01-04 16:15:47", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 10, "timestamp": "2011-01-04 13:22:06", "image": "", "title": "Diplomats not the only ones aiding Boeing business abroad", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tOver the weekend the New York Times<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/03/business/03wikileaks-boeing.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=business\"> ran a story </a>highlighting the diplomatic relations used to help Boeing acquire business in foreign nations, but the informal and potentially inappropriate dealings between diplomats and foreign leaders done for Boeing&#39;s benefit is not the only thing the U.S. government &nbsp;does to help the company&#39;s bottom line.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.exim.gov/\">Export-Import Bank</a> of the United States regularly issues loans and loan guarantees in foreign countires to help Boeing export its commercial aircraft. According to the Ex-Im Bank&#39;s annual reports for 2009 and 2010, the bank issued almost $20 billion in long-term loan guarantees in 20 foreign countries. About $15 billion of that total, or 75 percent, went toward the purchase of commercial aircraft made by Boeing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Ex-Im Bank&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.exim.gov/about/mission.cfm\">mission</a> is &quot;to assist in financing the export of U.S. goods and services to international markets.[It] enables U.S. companies &mdash; large and small &mdash; to turn export opportunities into real sales that help to maintain and create U.S. jobs and contribute to a stronger national economy.&quot;<a href=\"http://influenceexplorer.com/organization/boeing-co/93d723231bec403c9b88d4a0c5260959?cycle=2010\">&nbsp;Boeing</a>, a major defense contractor and top political contributor, spent over <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Boeing+Co&amp;year=2010\">$13 million lobbying congress </a>in 2010.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt&#39;s a longstanding pattern.

In between, we continued to publish the only resource for tracking congressional campaign fundraising, <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org\">Party Time</a>, updated our <a href=\"http://Eek. If that's the case, it's an interesting project but not worth too much to us. \">Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker</a>, delved into <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/search/?q=recovery\">Recovery.gov data</a> and <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/tag/Earmarks/\">earmark disclosures</a>, and, with the help of our friends at the <a href=\"http://www.publicintegrity.org\">Center for Public Integrity</a>, identified <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/tag/datamine/\">dozens</a> of high value federal data sets that government agencies have not released.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Data Mine project delved into everything from <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/new-govt-contractor-integrity-database-will-be-limits-public/\">PPIRS and FAPIIS</a> -- respectively the Past Performance Information Retrieval System and the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System, which are a pair of databases that track how well government contractors do their work and have never been publicly available -- to the Agriculture Department&#39;s <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/usdafarmsubsidy/\">Section 1614 database</a>, which allowed the Environmental Working Group to <a href=\"http://farm.ewg.org/\">identify</a> who really benefits from federal farming subsidies until Agriculture decided to change the way it made the data available, limiting its specificity. While the Obama administration made an effort to get agencies to release three high value data sets on the way to making far more federal data available, the Center for Public Integrity and Sunlight found plenty of data sets that were simply off limits. Take one more example: In the wake of the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster, we found a <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/british-petroleum/\">data set</a> that documented how many reported spills and other environmental accidents the company had had (more than 8,000); but to find out how severe these incidents were, or whether the company was fined or otherwise penalized for any of them was <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/coast-guard-database-makes-oil-spill-penalties-nearly-impossible/\">nearly impossible</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerhaps nothing better captures the state of transparency our reporters encountered in 2010 than Paul Blumenthal&#39;s February post, <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2010/02/12/the-legacy-of-billy-tauzin-the-white-house-phrma-deal/\">The Legacy of Billy Tauzin: The White House-PhRMA Deal</a>. Paul used a number of resources--including <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/WhiteHouseVisitors/\">White House visitor logs</a> that the Obama administration began voluntarily releasing in the fall of 2009 (though note MSNBC investigative reporter Bill Dedman&#39;s <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/msnbc-obama-administration-visitor-disclosure-policy-exempts-it/#comments\">critique</a> of those releases) and Sen. Max Baucus&#39; <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/Max_Baucus/Schedule\">voluntarily released shcedule</a>, to provide a blow-by-blow account of the lobbying effort that the <a href=\"http://influenceexplorer.com/organization/pharmaceutical-rsrch-mfrs-of-america/b939e8e3b46c4569ae0085b8a3dc38f1\">Pharmaceutial Research and Manufacturers of America</a> mounted to curtail some proposed reform measures and kill others in exchange for its support for the final bill. As Paul wrote, &quot;[P]harmaceutical industry lobbyists and executives met with top White House aides dozens of times to hammer out a deal that would secure industry support for the administration&#39;s health care reform agenda in exchange for the White House abandoning key elements of the president&#39;s promises to reform the pharmaceutical industry. They flooded Congress with campaign contributions, and hired dozens of former Capitol Hill insiders to push their case. How they did it...is a testament to how ingrained the grip of special interests remains in Washington.&quot; And were it not for the availability of a handful of records out of the tens if not hundreds of thousands that should be routinely disclosed--lobbying contacts with members of Congress and administration officials--Paul would not have been able to tell that story. (Sunlight&#39;s proposals for lobbying reform can be found <a href=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/policy/lobbying/Sunlight%20Foundation%20Goals%20for%20LDA%20Amendments.pdf\">here</a>.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPaul&#39;s health care reporting came in handy when Sunlight launched an ambitious new project, Sunlight Live, to cover the administration&#39;s health care summit with members of Congress that same month. Our goal was to provide contextual data about each speaker, ranging from health care industry contributions to the participants to their personal investments in the industry to the number of their former staffers who had gone through the revolving door to lobby for pharmaceutical, insurance, hospital and other health care interests. Some asked whether the ambitious effort--that combined social media, data jamming, a live broadcast and a real time blog with input from commenters with good old fashioned investigative reporting--were a <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/is-sunlight-foundations-health-care-summit-coverage-a-gamechanger/\">&quot;game changer.&quot;</a>&nbsp; We&#39;re not in the business of making predictions, but after also covering events like the conference committee hearings for the Dodd-Frank bill and the Ethics Committee hearing and House censure vote of Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., we can say we&#39;re more excited about the platform&#39;s potential than ever before, and are looking forward to its technical build-out under the direction of Sunlight Labs and our new online content manager, Joshua Hatch, who joins us from USAToday.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the wake of the Citizens United decision, we started looking into the impact that decision had on, first, <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/topics/citizensunited/\">state election laws</a> and then on <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/fec-approves-new-committee/\">congressional elections</a>, an effort that led to the creation of our <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/independent-expenditures/\">Follow the Unlimited Money</a> tool which tracked more than $454 million in independent expenditures and electioneering communications and <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/independent-expenditures/letters\">identified</a> what the Federal Election Commission calls &quot;independent expenditure only committees&quot; but what were quickly dubbed &quot;Super PACs&quot; by the media. We also delved into groups that don&#39;t disclose their donors, and even found examples of groups that did disclose, but whose disclosed donors were themselves <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/dead-end-disclosure-super-pacs-biggest-giver-shadowy-nonprofit-l/\">shadowy organizations</a> that keep the names of <em>their</em> funders secret (talk about deadend disclosure). Adding it all up just before election day, we <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/dark-money-donors/\">found</a> that Super PACs spent $110 million from undisclosed donors in an effort to influence 168 congressional elections in 2010.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe followed the insiders as well as the outsiders. Party Time continued to document fundraisers held by members of Congress--often hosted by lobbyists or the heads of political action committees trying to influence those lobbyists. We looked at financial industry lobbyists who <a href=\"http://blog.politicalpartytime.org/2010/04/22/financial-reform-lobbyists-host-fundraisers-for-senators/\">hosted fundraisers</a> for members of Congress while the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill was under consideration, and health care lobbyists who <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/health-industry-lobbyists-have-hosted-scores-fundraisers-summit-/\">hosted fundraisers</a> for members of Congress at the height of the debate over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In June 2010, the Washington Post reported that the Office of Congressional Ethics <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/16/AR2010061603032.html\">had launched</a> an investigation into eight House members who held &quot;financial services breakfasts&quot; or &quot;investment industry receptions&quot; while they considered the bill; invitations for most of those events can be found in our <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org\">Party Time</a> database.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs important as any of the stories we worked on ourselves, we also&nbsp; taught other reporters how to use the resoures that Sunlight and our grantees provide for digging into federal data. We spread the word of Sunlight at the National Institute of Computer Assisted Reporting conference, the Investigative Reporters and Editors conference, the American Society of Newspaper Editors conference, and the Online News Association conference, to name a few. We trained more than 1,200 journalists, sometimes partnering with great organizations like the Associated Press Managing Editors on specific projects and sometimes just showing off new Sunlight Labs tools like <a href=\"http://influenceexplorer.com\">Influence Explorer</a>, <a href=\"http://poligraft.com\">Poligraft</a> and <a href=\"http://politiwidgets.com\">Politiwidgets</a> and Reporting projects like <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org\">Party Time</a>, the <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/\">Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker</a> and our <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/independent-expenditures/\">Follow the Unlimited Money tool</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd we&#39;re already building new tools for 2011. Look for our Lobbyist registration tracker to debut early in January, the first of many exciting projects we have lined up for next year.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2010-12-23 16:27:54", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "end-year-we-know-it", "tags": "", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2272, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2011-08-18 14:51:00", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 4, "timestamp": "2010-12-20 10:11:17", "image": "", "title": "Information scarce on bids for failed banks", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is making less information available to the public about how it is dealing with the <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html\">rising number of bank failures</a> in 2010. Over the last year, the agency has failed to post a complete list of bids on 41 percent of the deals it makes with other banks to take over failing institutions--and what information it does provide is more limited than before.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBefore May 2009, the FDIC would provide, upon request, the names of all entities placing bids on failed banks and how much each of them bid for the bank in question. Then the agency suddenly stopped--a move that provoked sharp complaints about lack of transparency, particularly in the business community.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMany bidders and those that advise them themselves rely on this information to help them develop business strategy for placing their own bids. &quot;We have been doing this for 20 years, since the late &#39;80s,&quot; Randy Dennis, the president of DD&amp;F Consulting Group <a href=\"http://www.americanbanker.com/issues/174_162/bids_for_failed_banks_a_state_secret-1001247-1.html\">told</a> the American Banker at the time. &quot;We have every winner and loser for every FDIC acquisition for a long, long time. It allows us to have a better perspective, and the bankers to be better-informed bidders.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKen Thomas, a Florida banking consultant who files Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests frequently with the agency, observes that the agency stopped making bids public after a consortium of private equity firms including the Carlyle Group and Blackstone Capital Partners <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2009/pr09072.html\">bought</a> BankUnited, which held $12 billion in assets, in Coral Gables, Florida in May 2009. &quot;Losers do not like their names being mentioned as losers,&quot; he says.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever the agency has not revealed why it made its decision. In November 2009, the FDIC board of directors announced a <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/open/plan/\">new policy</a>--a decision made behind closed doors, with no public comments solicited, according to FDIC spokesman Greg Hernandez. It would start providing information about these bids online, but in more limited fashion than before. Rather than providing information about all bidders, the agency would post the name of the winning bidder and the details of its bid. It would omit all information about the second-place bidders. The names of the rest of the losing bidders and the details of the bids would be provided, but delinked so that it would not be possible to connect a given bidder with its bid.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs first <a href=\"http://www.americanbanker.com/issues/175_187/fdic-falls-shorts-of-its-disclosure-pledge-1026314-1.html\">reported</a> by the American Banker, the FDIC has been slow to meet its pledge. Since the announcement of the policy, the agency has failed to post this limited information for 73 out of 167 failed banks that had purchasers since November 2009, according to a review by the Sunlight Foundation. For the rest of these banks, the purchase agreement is available.&nbsp; (See spreadsheet below for Sunlight&#39;s analysis, based on FDIC&#39;s list of failed banks, which can be found <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html\">here</a>. When bid information is supplied for a bank, the &quot;bid info available&quot; column is marked &quot;yes&quot; and a hyperlink is provided to that information. In some cases there is no acquiring institution; those are marked &quot;n/a.&quot;)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhy the delay? Hernandez says it&#39;s a matter of resources. &quot;It takes some time to have the legal documents reviewed for things like proprietary information...Once those legal documents are examined fully, they are posted online. Because of the large number of failures the past three years, the process is moving as quickly as possible,&quot; he wrote in response to an email query.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;We&#39;d like to have as many facts as possible to see where the bidding process ended,&quot; says <a href=\"http://www.stinson.com/BobMonroe/\">C. Robert Monroe</a>, a partner with the Missouri-based Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP, who advises clients on acquiring failed banks. He adds however, that &quot;history is great,&quot; but you still have to make a bid within your comfort level.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Sunlight Foundation today filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the FDIC asking the agency to provide all information about failed bank bids, including names and details of the bids.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"425px\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://data.sunlightlabs.com/w/upxu-unj8/38mm-etse?cur=ODqhB15a219&amp;from=root\" title=\"Failed Bank Bids12 20 2010\" width=\"500px\">&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;http://data.sunlightlabs.com/dataset/Failed-Bank-Bids12-20-2010/upxu-unj8&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; _cke_saved_href=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;http://data.sunlightlabs.com/dataset/Failed-Bank-Bids12-20-2010/upxu-unj8&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; title=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;Failed Bank Bids12 20 2010&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; target=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;_blank&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Failed Bank Bids12 20 2010&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;</iframe>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<a href=\"http://www.socrata.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Powered by Socrata</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n", "date_published": "2010-12-22 15:53:57", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "information-scarce-bids-failed-banks", "tags": "Finance Data Catalog, FDIC, failed banks, banks", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2274, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-12-22 16:42:28", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 4, "timestamp": "2010-12-22 15:56:50", "image": "", "title": "Key GOP lawmaker wants to stop financial regulations", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tReuters <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BL2UX20101222\">reports</a> that Rep.

To see all the data, click <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org\">here</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDisclosures filed in 2009 show that foreign governments, political parties and government controlled entities, including some for-profit corporations, <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/admin/reporting/post/2262/\">spent $60 million</a> influencing official Washington. They made thousands of contacts--everything from emails and phone calls to in-person meetings--with government officials, policy wonks at think tanks, syndicated columnists and journalists. FARA documents provide insights into foreign governments approach Washington, and how D.C. lobbying firms influence public officials and public perceptions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor example, on July 23, 2009, Ambassador Hugh Llorens sent a <a href=\"http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2009/07/09TEGUCIGALPA645.html\">cable</a> outlining why the removal of Honduran President Manuel Zelaya was most likely illegal. Titled &quot;Open and Shut: The Case of the Honduran Coup,&quot; the document read in part, &quot;No matter what the merits of the case against Zelaya, his forced removal by the military was clearly illegal, and [interim president Roberto] Micheletti&#39;s ascendance as &#39;interim president&#39; was totally illegitimate.&quot; Llorens, a career foreign service officer who&#39;d also served in Spain and on the National Security Council, added, &quot;Faced with that lack of clarity, the military and/or whoever ordered the coup fell back on what they knew -- the way Honduran presidents were removed in the past: a bogus resignation letter and a one-way ticket to a neighboring country.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Sept. 8, <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/country/Honduras/\">Honduras</a> hired Chlopak, Leonard, Schechter and Associates to &quot;achieve a better positioning of the government before international public opinion,&quot; including efforts to &quot;design a persuasion campaign at an international level, particularly among the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate,&quot; among others. Peter Schechter, a former deputy staff director for the House Subcommittee on International Development Institutions and Finance, signed the contract; over the next few months, the firm&#39;s lobbyists had multiple contacts with members of Congress and their staffs, including staffers of <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/legislator/DeMint%2C%20James/\">Sen. Jim DeMint, D-N.C.</a>, who became an ardent supporter of the provisional government, and even took to the pages of the Wall Street Journal after a visit to the country to <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703298004574459762462353766.html\">write</a>, &quot;In a day packed with meetings, we met only one person in Honduras who opposed Mr. Zelaya&#39;s ouster, who wishes his return, and who mystifyingly rejects the legitimacy of the November elections: U.S. Ambassador Hugo Llorens.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe preoccupations of diplomats, as demonstrated in the Wikileaks cables, were also the subject of intense lobbying efforts. An April 9, 2009 <a href=\"http://&lt;a href=&quot;http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2009/04/09STATE34688.html\">cable</a> recounts a meeting between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and United Arab Emirates&#39; Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed and Ambassador Yousef al Otaiba to discuss, among other things, &quot;action the UAE can take to encourage a positive Congressional review&quot; for its effort to sign an agreement to receive U.S. nuclear technology.

In 2009 the <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/country/Republic%20of%20Congo/\">Republic of Congo (Brazzaville)</a> spent over $3.9 million on lobbying activities and hired several high profile DC based lobbying firms, including the<a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/registrant/Livingston%20Group/\"> Livingston Group</a> and <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/registrant/Chlopak%2C%20Leonard%2C%20Schechter%20%26%20Associates/\">Chlopak Leonard</a>, which represents several African nations, to fight lawsuits brought on by <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/corruption-charges-prompt-congo-to-lobby-congress\">&ldquo;vulture funds.</a><a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/corruption-charges-prompt-congo-to-lobby-congress\">&rdquo; </a>The funds buy up defaulted sovereign debt for pennies on the dollar and then institute court proceedings to recoup much larger amounts.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublic of Congo&rsquo;s government continued to lobby Congress in 2009 on bills introduced to protect debtor nations from lawsuits brought by a handful private equity firms that buy defaulted debt. If such a bill would pass, it would ensure than no U.S. national could invest in these firms and no U.S. court could hear these cases. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., introduced the <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-2932\">bill</a> in June 2009; she also sponsored a similar measure in 2008.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongo also conducted a major public relations campaign on climate change issues in the Congo basin to help protect the natural habitat which is disappearing at a fast pace&mdash;about two million acres a year due to logging, mining and excessive farming.</p>\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 228px; height: 187px;\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t<td height=\"13\" width=\"153\">\r\n\t\t\t\tCountry</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"75\">\r\n\t\t\t\tAmount</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t<td height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t\tCayman Islands</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"right\" class=\"xl24\">\r\n\t\t\t\t$7,890,000</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t<td height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t\tUnited Arab Emirates</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"right\" class=\"xl24\">\r\n\t\t\t\t$5,378,000</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t<td height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t\tRepublic of Congo</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"right\" class=\"xl24\">\r\n\t\t\t\t$3,944,000</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t<td height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t\tMorocco</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"right\" class=\"xl24\">\r\n\t\t\t\t$3,155,000</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t<td height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t\tBahamas</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"right\" class=\"xl24\">\r\n\t\t\t\t$2,577,000</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t<td height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t\tBrazil</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"right\" class=\"xl24\">\r\n\t\t\t\t$2,482,000</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t<td height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t\tSerbia</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"right\" class=\"xl24\">\r\n\t\t\t\t$2,214,000</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t<td height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t\tTurkey</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"right\" class=\"xl24\">\r\n\t\t\t\t$1,679,000</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t<td height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t\tVanuatu</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"right\" class=\"xl24\">\r\n\t\t\t\t$1,633,000</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t<td height=\"13\">\r\n\t\t\t\tTaiwan</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"right\" class=\"xl24\">\r\n\t\t\t\t$1,548,000</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Lawmakers with the most contacts</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReports filed under FARA in 2009 show that individual lobbyists working for foreign clients communicated with lawmakers or their staff 17,000 times, including 2,280 phone calls, 9,000 email correspondences and 2,900 face-to-face meetings. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLawmakers that had the most contacts with lobbyists for various foreign clients usually held a gavel, including Speaker <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/legislator/Pelosi%2C%20Nancy/\">Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.</a>, who had about 85 contacts&mdash;either with her personally or with her staff.

The Supreme Court ordered the military to remove Zelaya, and <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/roberto_micheletti/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Roberto Micheletti</a>, the next in succession, was installed as the new head of state. When the international community condemned the removal of Zelaya, the <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/country/Honduras/\">Honduran administration</a> hired Chlopak, Leonard, Schechter &amp; Associates to represent their interests, leading to an extensive lobbying and media campaign that cost $131,000 in the last months of 2009.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHonduran lobbying efforts found strong support in Congress and a willing backer in Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., who put out a press release supporting the coup. He took to the pages of the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703298004574459762462353766.html\">Wall Street Journal</a> to write, &ldquo;As all strong democracies do after cleansing themselves of usurpers, Honduras has moved on.&rdquo; FARA records show that about a week before this column was published, Juan Corti&ntilde;as-Garcia, a lobbyist with Chlopak, contacted DeMint&rsquo;s office and the Republican leadership of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tForeign Agent Registration Act (FARA) <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org\">records</a> show that there were over 60 other contacts during the crisis between Sept. 21, 2009 and Nov. 11, 2009; the <a href=\"http://www.fara.gov/docs/5774-Exhibit-AB-20091021-8.pdf\">contract</a> was terminated at the end of December 2009.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Honduran lobbying effort benefited from congressional connections of the hired lobbyists. The website of Chlopak, Leonard, Schechter &amp; Associates notes that Corti&ntilde;as-Garcia, &ldquo;spent six years working in the U.S. Congress as a Press Secretary and Legislative Assistant for Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., a senior member of the House International Relations Committee.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDuring that time, he worked on domestic and international affairs particularly dealing with U.S. policy toward Latin America.&rdquo; Corti&ntilde;as contacted Republican Professional Staff members Robyn Wapner and Yleem Poblete of the House Foreign Affairs Committee three and five time respectively. Corti&ntilde;as also contacted Fred Ratliff from the House Foreign Affairs Committee four times. <a href=\"http://www.legistorm.com/\">Legistorm </a>records show Wapner, Poblete, and Ratliff are former employees of Ros-Lehtinen and worked there at the same time as Cortinas.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Small Countries Getting Bang for their Buck?</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHonduras is one of several small, relatively poor countries hiring lobbyists to influence the U.S. government. FARA records show that across the Atlantic, there are several small African countries, some in the throes of civil war, that spend millions mainly to gain tariff free trade with the US.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe 30,000 square mile country of Lesotho in the southern part of the African continent spent $200,000 to hire Whitaker Group to promote its interests in 2009. The goal was to promote Lesotho&rsquo;s trade interests by focusing on The <a href=\"http://www.agoa.gov/\">African Growth and Opportunity Act</a> (AGOA.) Between January 2007 and December 2009, there were at least 56 meetings recorded in the FARA <a href=\"http://www.fara.gov/docs/5539-Exhibit-AB-20100201-14.pdf\">records</a> on behalf of The Lesotho National Development Corporation (LNDC), most of which were described as related to AGOA.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUganda also contracts with the Whitaker Group for assistance with AGOA lobbying. Their <a href=\"http://www.fara.gov/docs/5539-Exhibit-AB-20090330-11.pdf\">contract</a> awarded Whitaker $1,035,000 for a year of service, beginning March 2008. And they weren&rsquo;t alone: other African nations lobbying on AGOA included Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire, Ghana and Kenya.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe largest opportunity for AGOA expansion came when Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash. introduced <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4101/show\">H.R.4101 </a>in November of 2009 to expand duty free status to all goods from countries with AGOA eligibility. This bill presented a great opportunity to AGAO members to expand their benefits to items not covered under the original terms. Expanding the scope of AGOA would have been especially beneficial to countries like Uganda that have many exports that are not eligible under AGOA.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMcDermott&rsquo;s staff was contacted 15 times, with several occurring in April and May of 2008. As a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and a member of the trade subcommittee, his office was contacted about AGOA issues 20 times before he introduced his legislation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Small Nations Target U.S. Tax Laws</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAmong bills that were heavily lobbied on in 2009 were legislation in the House and Senate&mdash;respectively H.R. 1265 and S.506, the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act&mdash;that aimed to crack down on tax havens. The bill that was introduced in March of 2009 listed 34 countries&mdash;all of which have hired lobbyists in the past few years to lobby on the issue.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFARA records show that the Bank of the Netherlands Antilles put forward the strongest lobbying efforts to oppose these bills. The bank relied on the lobbying firm Jones and Walker, which has an alliance with the Livingston Group, and spent over <a href=\"http://www.fara.gov/docs/5355-Exhibit-AB-20090918-6.pdf\">$40,000</a> a month.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tArnold Havens, a Jones and Walker lobbyist, shows up most frequently in regard this act. Haven&rsquo;s career as a lobbyist comes after years of working on international affairs as General Counsel of the United States Department of the Treasury which oversees the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe revolving door between lobbying groups and Congress is apparent in other filings.

Zeliff Jr. on its payroll.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>UAE Lobbies for Access to U.S. Nuclear Technology</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2009, the United Arab Emirates pushed for nuclear cooperation with the United States and sought to procure nuclear technology; the government of the oil-rich nation hired some of the top lobbying firms to establish a 123 agreement, named after a section of the Atomic Energy Act that sets out the terms for transfers of nuclear technology.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Embassy of the United Arab Emirates contracted with the international law firm DLA Piper, while the Government of Dubai relied on lobby and law firm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld. Lobbying efforts included outreach to political notables, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-MD. <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/country/United%20Arab%20Emirates/\">Lobbyists for the UAE</a> contacted 17 other offices of Senate Foreign Affairs Committee members and another 34 offices of lawmakers on the House Foreign as part of their efforts.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tShortly after, UAE&rsquo;s efforts came to fruition when, on May 21, 2009, President Obama submitted to Congress an agreement for peaceful Nuclear Cooperation with the emirates, which the State Department said contained the &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2009/05/123747.htm\">strongest nonproliferation conditions</a>&rdquo; of any U.S. nuclear agreement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Kuwaiti Detainees</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2009, the International Counsel Bureau, a law firm based in Kuwait, began lobbying the U.S. Congress for the release of prisoners from Guantanamo. The organization went on a media blitz, placing op-eds and getting media attention at a time when some lawmakers and the President were promising to close down Guantanamo quickly.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter it became clear that President Obama&rsquo;s pledge to quickly close down Guantanamo would not happen, the International Council Bureau&rsquo;s shifted its efforts to gaining media attention for the detainees that have been held for eight years without being formally charged with a crime. Between August 6 and Sept. 17, 2009 the law firm sent out 555 press releases to retain the public&rsquo;s interest in the Guantanamo habeas corpus trials.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe biggest development in the detainee case came when three Kuwaiti detainees received habeas hearings. The first hearing occurred on August of 2009 for Fawzi al-Odah, which he was lost&mdash;Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly denied his request. In July of 2009, the Kuwaiti detainee Khalid al-Mutairi won his habeas request, and, in September 2009, Fouad al-Rabiah also won release. The International Council Bureau continues to lobby on behalf of the release of the two remaining Kuwaiti detainees in Guantanamo Bay.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2010-12-02 12:36:45", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "highlights-2009-small-nations-spending-big-lobbying-middle-easte", "tags": "FARA, Kuwait, Foreign lobbying, FLIT", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2261, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-12-01 13:44:16", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2010-12-01 13:41:52", "image": "", "title": "Orszag to Citigroup?", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tBloomberg.com is <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-01/citigroup-said-to-discuss-hiring-former-white-house-budget-director-orszag.html\">reporting</a> that Peter Orszag, formerly director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Obama administration, is in talks with <a href=\"http://influenceexplorer.com/organization/citigroup-inc/4e6bc9a6b7dc40d7b9b00d58c0e359db\">Citigroup</a> to join its investment banking division.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) meeting logs show that Independent Community Bankers of America representatives met four times with agency officials since August, when the agency first put meeting records on-line in a bid to increase transparency.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe revised formula for assessing bank contributions to the deposit insurance fund was already <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/text?version=enr&amp;nid=t0:enr:2754\">spelled out</a> as some of the nearly 250 rules changes mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. However, confirmed an ICBA representative, the FDIC proposals clarified a break for so-called &quot;bankers&#39; banks&quot; and &quot;custodial banks,&quot; which service other banks. The law had required these institutions be treated differently, but had not spelled out exactly how. ICBA includes bankers banks as members.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile community banks comprise the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/business/24fdic.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business\">bulk</a>&nbsp;of the &quot;problem banks&quot;--those the FDIC believes are in danger of failing--they have long <a href=\"http://www.icba.org/news/newsreleasedetail.cfm?ItemNumber=59191&amp;sn.ItemNumber=1733\">argued</a> that they did not engage in the risky behavior that led to the financial crisis and that larger banks should share a larger share of the burden for bailouts. In July, when Congress passed the financial regulatory reform bill, the ICBA counted the section on the deposit insurance fund &nbsp;assessments, which requires the agency to take into account all assets for a bank rather than just domestic deposits, as a <a href=\"http://www.icba.org/news/newsreleasedetail.cfm?ItemNumber=74242&amp;sn.ItemNumber=1733&amp;tn.ItemNumber=1915\">win</a>. ICBA has <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=Independent+Community+Bankers+of+America&amp;year=2010\">reported</a> spending $3.6 million on lobbying in 2010, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and the group&#39;s PAC has <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00032698\">contributed</a> $1.3 &nbsp;million to federal candidates this election cycle.</p>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\r\n<p>\r\n\tOver all, 14 of the 39 meetings with private sector interests posted by the FDIC involved discussion of the &quot;assessment base&quot; issues, or the deposit insurance fund (See spreadsheets below). These included a meeting on September 15 with members of the Financial Services Forum, which represents some of the larger banks expected to be hit harder by new assessment formulas. Other firms that weighed in included the American Bankers Association, the European bank Credit Agricole and various state chapters of banking associations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tErica Hurt, a spokesperson for the Financial Services Forum who attended the September meeting says that the deposit insurance issue was &quot;not one of our top tier issues,&quot; and that at the meeting the group was concerned about discussing the time table for the new rules and other issues related to the implementation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe American Bankers Association (ABA), which represents both large and small banks, remained neutral on the deposit insurance fund changes during the legislative debate, said Rob Strand, an economist with the group. &quot;Some of our members felt one way, some felt another way.&quot; Strand said the ABA had &quot;fine tuning&quot; suggestions and would make its views known in formal comments on the proposed regulations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs helpful as the FDIC&rsquo;s meeting logs, which it updates bi-weekly, are in revealing to the public how the feds are conducting their regulatory sausage making, they also contain shortcomings. Visitors are not always listed with their exact affiliations, making it hard to connect names to employers. When affiliations are listed, it&rsquo;s often by acronym rather than a full name. And FDIC staff are not identified by their titles.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor example, on October 27, a group of 13 people reportedly met with agency staff to discuss assessment issues. These people are identified as representing Northern Trust, State Street, and Bank of New York/Mellon. But the individuals are not linked to their employers. Custodial banks such as these, which hold investments for other firms or individuals, got a break in the &nbsp;new rules.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn other cases, the FDIC meeting records lump together large groups of people under vague identifications. For example, on October 26, 16 people identified as working for &ldquo;law firms&rdquo; reportedly met with FDIC staff to discuss the issue of &ldquo;living wills&rdquo;&mdash;the plans mandated under the law that large financial institutions much have in place that would make their liquidation simpler in the event of financial catastrophe.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome of these visitors are relatively easy to fingerprint, thanks to their unusual names&mdash;i.e. Knox McIlwain <a href=\"http://www.cgsh.com/kmcilwain/\">appears</a> to be an associate with Cleary Gottlieb, specializing in derivatives and finance. But when you have an attorney named John Douglas or Jack Murphy, it is a lot more difficult to figure out where they work.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor some events, the FDIC simply lists &ldquo;Visitors, multiple&rdquo; as attendees at meetings to discuss such vaguely described issues as &ldquo;what are near/mid/long term issues FDIC will work on in reaction to legislation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition to the meeting logs, the agency also <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/reform/events.html\">posts</a> information about round table discussions sponsored by the agency dealing with aspects of implementing the new law,&nbsp;including <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/reform/attendees2.html\">this one</a> on September 24 on the deposit insurance reform issue, where attendees are identified by firm and agency officials by title. The agency also makes <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/reform/comments/index.html\">public</a> comments received from the general public.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the end, the ICBA didn&rsquo;t get everything it wanted in the proposed deposit insurance rules. The group would have liked to see the new assessments applied retroactively as spelled out in <a href=\"http://fdic.gov/regulations/reform/correspondence.html\">this letter</a> to the agency, however, asserted that changes would need to be made in how banks report their assets before it could implement new formulas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;We accepted the fact that [the new assessment formulas] do require some operational changes,&rdquo; said Chris Cole, senior regulatory counsel and senior vice president for the ICBA, who attended the meetings with the FDIC.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tScroll down to see spreadsheets of FDIC visitors and FDIC officials hosting meetings.

Charles Rangel faces an adjudicatory hearing before the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct--better known as the&nbsp;<a href=\"\">House Ethics Committee</a>--this morning. We&#39;ll are covering the whole hearing on&nbsp;<a href=\"\">Sunlight Live</a>, delving into the charges of violations of ethics rules that in some cases go back years. Rangel stands accused of everything from soliciting donations to a nonprofit center that bears his name from interests with business before the Ways and Means Committee, which he chaired at the time, to abusing his parking privileges in the House garage. (A full list of charges is available&nbsp;<a href=\"\">here</a>).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Reporting Group has followed Rangel&#39;s ethical lapses for some time, and contributed some of our own research (see&nbsp;<a href=\"\">here</a>&nbsp;for our report detailing omissions from Rangel&#39;s financial disclosures over the years--by our count, going back to 1979, Rangel misreported assets worth between $239,026 and $831,000). But we&#39;ve also followed the ethical shortcomings of quite a few other sitting members.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn Rangel&#39;s <a href=\"http://ethics.house.gov/Media/PDF/Rangel%20Response%20to%20SAV.pdf\">formal response</a> to the charges, he noted that several other members of Congress had violations little different than his. For example, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and four senators no longer in Congress (three are deceased, and the fourth, former Republican leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., is a Washington lobbyist) solicited funds to support their own eponymous, university-based nonprofits. In his more colorful floor statement last August, Rangel, a prolific fundraiser for House Democrats, defended himself by noting that he&#39;d gone to &nbsp;&quot;Republican districts&quot; to raise money to help elect his colleagues (it comes in about 1:35 into the clip).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<object width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/rWCuHoSoDEE?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/rWCuHoSoDEE?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></embed></object>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRangel&#39;s live appearance before the House Ethics Committee is a welcome change from how such proceedings usually go--evidence is taken behind closed doors, the member or members under investigation respond behind closed doors, there are some negotiations as to punishment (the Ethics Committee reportedly offered Rangel a <a href=\"http://www.aolnews.com/surge-desk/article/charlie-rangel-ethics-deal-on-or-off/19573933\">deal</a> to settle the allegations against him), and sunlight--having members publicly defend their conduct--is relatively rare. Many observers of the late Sen. Ted Stevens&#39; trial for filing inaccurate financial disclosure forms--omitting gifts given him by Veco Corporation and its CEO Bill Allen--believe that it was the long serving Alaska lawmaker&#39;s own testimony, including his insistence that he had many things in his home that didn&#39;t belong to him, that convicted him. (Due to prosecutorial misconduct, the <a href=\"http:// http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/npr-charges-against-stevens-dropped/\">charges</a> against Stevens were ultimately dismissed.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere are some members of the House who&#39;ve run into ethical difficulties who didn&#39;t face the same sort of public inquiry that Rangel (and later this month, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.) will face.

Many of these candidates made their opposition to the President&#39;s health care law a central issue in their campaigns. But to what extent will Tuesday&#39;s elections actually affect the course of reform?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLikely Speaker of the House John Boehner has been an outspoken proponent of the &quot;repeal and replace&quot; approach, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/127435-boehner-voters-rejected-obama-and-pelosi-gave-mandate-for-cuts\">telling reporters yesterday </a>that he wants to begin &quot;lay(ing) the groundwork&quot; to repeal the law. But overturning health care reform would require a two-thirds majority to beat an Obama veto, a mark the GOP falls far short of in the House and the Senate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInstead, Republicans may have a better chance of limiting the law&#39;s scope by tightening oversight -- and the purse strings. Majority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Va., acknowledged this in his 22-page letter to Republicans yesterday, saying that if necessary he intends to &quot;begin repealing [the law] piece by piece, blocking funding for its implementation.&quot; This could gum up the works enough to cause headaches for Democrats trying to meet the law&#39;s various deadlines.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe election may have significant impact at the state level, as well. State insurance commissioners have already had a hand in determining how the health care law is implemented. As <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/lobbying-dollars-flow-health-care-reform/\">we reported earlier this year</a>, a body of commissioners has influence over what percent of premiums insurers must spend on patient care. It&#39;s a detail of the law that&#39;s been hotly debated by insurance companies and consumer advocates, and was reported on a great deal of lobbying reports after the law passed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInsurance commissioners also have varying degrees of control over companies&#39; ability to raise their premiums. California&#39;s outgoing commissioner, Steve Poizner, <a href=\"http://www.ibj.com/anthem-blue-cross-withdraws-big-california-rate-hike/PARAMS/article/19677\">helped beat back</a> a proposed 30 to 39 percent <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wellpoint-division-raked-over-insurance-rate-hike-2010-02-10\">rate hike</a> by Blue Cross licensee WellPoint earlier this year. Commissioners have the power to enforce various aspects of reform, and to determine, for example, <a href=\"http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2010/November/03/states-health-law-governors-election.aspx\">how state exchanges will operate</a>. This could have a big effect on how the law impacts consumers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn most states, governors appoint insurance commissioners, although in four states, they were elected directly on Tuesday. (Three of the four were <a href=\"http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2010/November/03/states-health-law-governors-election.aspx\">opponents of the law</a>). Republican gains in governorships will likely bring more commissioners into the &quot;opposed&quot; column: new GOP leaders in Iowa, Michigan, New Mexico, Tennessee, Wyoming, Florida, Wisconsin and Ohio all <a href=\"http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2010/11/01/114513.htm\">have the power to choose their commissioners</a>. (Maine&#39;s is appointed as well, but the next one won&#39;t be named until 2013).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThree states also put one of the reform law&#39;s key provisions up for a direct referendum on Tuesday.

A few that might still disclose their donors, but others, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a non-profit, 501(c)6 organization, and Crossroads GPS, a non-profit 501(c) 4, are not required to. Other organizations that are required to disclose donors, known as 527s after the section of the tax code they&#39;re organized under, might not have to file their quarterly disclosure reports until after the Nov. 2 election.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/independent-expenditures/search?q=chamber\">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a>, has spent the most among the dark money committees, followed by the<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/independent-expenditures/search?q=American+Future+Fund\"> American Future Fund</a> which has spent the most in the Alabama second district race running ads in opposition to Rep. Bobby Bright, D-Ala., and <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/independent-expenditures/search?q=Crossroads\">Crossroads GPS</a>., whose&nbsp;biggest target, drawing more than $4.4 million worth of negative ads, has been Illinois Senate candidate Giannoulias.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to an analysis of the reports filed with the FEC, there is no pattern yet that these groups that are keeping their donor base a secret are spending money in a specific geographical area or are spending more liberally on some races, but with still a few days from Nov. 2 a better picture may emerge in the weeks and months to come.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe 2010 mid-terms are the first election in which organizations can take unlimited donations from corporations, labor unions and individuals, due to the Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United case, setting the stage for non-profit organizations that don&#39;t have to disclose donors to expressly advocate the victory or defeat of federal candidates. Some organizations that do disclose donors show only contributions from these nonprofit organizations, meaning that the ultimate source of political spending remains hidden.&nbsp;The ruling also allowed labor unions to use their dues to fund political advertising, opening the floodgates to union money.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is also the first time there has been a <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/10/15/court-rulings-change-elections-independent-spending-dwarfs-party-spending-in-midterm/\">dramatic change</a> in the spending patterns as outside organizations have collectively dwarfed the spending by Republican and Democratic party committees, which have most often taken the lead in independent spending.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/infographic_update1.jpg\" style=\"width: 525px; height: 722px;\" /></p>\r\n", "date_published": "2010-10-28 15:53:41", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "dark-money-donors", "tags": "independent expenditures, super PACs,", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2250, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-10-28 11:04:59", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 10, "timestamp": "2010-10-27 13:09:45", "image": "", "title": "RightChange.com Inc. funded by pharmaceutical industry figure", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tFred Eshelman, CEO of North Carolina-based Pharmaceutical Product Development, has given $3.38 million to RightChange.com, an organization taking part in the onslaught of outside spending this election cycle, according to documents filed with the IRS.

I googled the group and didn&#39;t find anything about it; by Monday they&#39;d set up a <a href=\"http://cssactiondev.org/\">website</a>. Curious, I asked Ryan Sibley, who&#39;s been all things post-Citizens United for us, to see what she could find out about the group.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen I sat down to edit her&nbsp;<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/grassroots-group/\">investigation</a> into the 501(c)4 organization, which can run all kinds of political ads without revealing its donors, my head started to spin. There&#39;s a D.C. law firm that has the same address, and shares with eight other groups similar to CSS. There&#39;s a P.R. firm that handles its records. Though the FEC disclosures filed by the group make no mention of it, CSS (which stands for Citizens for Strength and Security) shares website artwork with another group, this one a 527 called (you guessed it) <a href=\"http://www.usacss.org/\">Citizens for Strength and Security</a>. Related or not? We&#39;re not sure -- Ryan could never get anyone involved with any of the groups on the phone long enough to ask.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile I was editing and talking to Ryan about the story, I started doodling the connections -- this handy guide actually helped me get through the edit, but it gives one an idea of just how difficult it is to follow the disclosures around these independent groups and determine who these groups actually are. Apologies for the scrawled handwriting and the bad artwork--this wasn&#39;t produced with an eye to publication, but it does show how muddled following the money has become.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img alt=\"Follow the muddled money\" src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/BRN_93E264_021060.jpg\" style=\"width: 608px; height: 859px; \" /></p>\r\n", "date_published": "2010-10-07 15:03:07", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "editors-notebook-following-muddled-money", "tags": "\"independent expenditures\",\"CSS Action Fund\", \"Sen.

The organization, which made its first noise in the 2010 mid-term elections by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/independent-expenditures/search?q=Css+action+fund\">spending $640,000 supporting Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash</a>&nbsp;in late September, shares a Washington, D.C. address with similar advocacy groups and lists political pros as its main players.*</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCSS Action Fund lists a Southeast Washington, D.C., address that is home to the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sandlerreiff.com/\">Sandler Reiff and Young</a>, a law firm that, according to its <a href=\"http://www.sandlerreiff.com/firm-profile/\">website</a>, &quot;represents a broad range of non-profit organizations, political committees, party committees, foundations, advocacy groups, candidates, political consulting and government relations firms, labor unions and trade associations, vendors of services for the political and non-profit markets and major contributors to political and non-profit groups.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition to CSS Action Fund, eight other groups that have registered with the FEC and made political expenditures this cycle and in previous cycles list Sandler Reiff and Young&#39;s address as their own. CSS Action Fund and its eight &quot;office mates&quot; all support Democratic candidates by making independent expenditures or electioneering communications. Repeated calls to Sandler Reiff and Young for comments went unanswered.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCSS Action Fund&#39;s FEC disclosure lists Jessica Bradley, an employee of <a href=\"http://www.hilltoppublicsolutions.com/politicalcampaigns/politicalcampaigns.htm\">Hilltop Public Solutions</a> based in Washington D.C., as custodian of the group&#39;s records. HPS is a political strategizing firm that specializes in organizing campaigns and generating electioneering communications, such as the TV ad that ran in Tacoma, Washington earlier this month supporting Murray. Multiple attempts to speak with Bradley have gone unanswered.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere is another group registered with the Federal Election Commission known as<a href=\"http://www.usacss.org/\"> Citizens for Strength and Security,</a> a name almost identical to the group in question. Public filings don&#39;t indicate any connection between the two groups beyond their names. The two list different addresses on their disclosures and different people are listed as having responsibility for their respective records. However, &nbsp;the websites for the two are eerily similar. Both are vague in detail, but use the same images of people posed as regular and working class. CSS Action Fund, the group supporting Murray, is a 501(c)4, while Citizens for Strength and Security is a 527.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGroups registered as 501(c)4s do not have to disclose their donors, 527s do. In the current election cycle, Citizens for Strength and Security, the 527, has drawn most of <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail_contribs.php?ein=263220209&amp;cycle=2010\">its support </a>from labor unions, including Service Employees International Union and the Communication Workers of America, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. We emailed Citizens for Strength and Security, but got an error message in response that said &quot;The e-mail message could not be delivered because the user&#39;s mailfolder is full.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA spokesperson for<a href=\"http://www.pattymurray.com/home\"> Patty Murray&rsquo;s campaign </a>said she had never heard of Citizens for Strength and Security Action Fund and didn&rsquo;t know who contributed to paying for the advertisement. However, she did acknowledge the ads had run and were in favor of Murray.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPatty Murray is a supporter of the DISCLOSE Act, a bill that aimed to ensure that donors paying for campaign ads are disclosed to the public. The bill passed the House but failed in the Senate. <a href=\"http://www.pattymurray.com/news/releases?id=0059\">Murray has been critical of her opponent,</a> Dino Rossi, for not supporting the DISCLOSE Act and claims he refused to disclose people paying for attack ads. When asked whether the senator would like CSS to disclose its donors, Julie Edwards, the spokesperson for the campaign, did not directly address the question.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Sen. Murray is a strong supporter of the DISCLOSE Act that would require organizations to disclose donors and stand by their ads,&quot; Edwards said. &quot;She has consistently voted for it and it was blocked by Senate Republicans. &nbsp;The DISCLOSE Act would make sure voters know who is paying for ads.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere is a list of the other groups sharing and address with CSS Action Fund:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/independent-expenditures/search?q=blue+america\">Blue America PAC</a></li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tBlue America Independent Expenditure Committee</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tNational Democratic Law Students Council</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tMatthew 25 Network</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tPatriot Majority Midwest</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/independent-expenditures/committee/patriot-majority\">Patriot Majority</a></li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tPatriot Majority West</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/independent-expenditures/search?q=american+public\">American Public Policy Committee</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t*--Note: This paragraph was corrected to more accurately reflect CSS Action Fund&#39;s self-characterization.</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2010-10-07 11:54:22", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "grassroots-group", "tags": "\"independent expenditures\",\"CSS Action Fund\", \"Sen.

Both found that FOIA requests were handled only by career federal employees, not political appointees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&ldquo;We determined that SSA political appointees were sometimes made aware of or reviewed information requests; however, we found no evidence of FOIA information requests being detoured, unusually scrutinized, delayed, or hindered by SSA political appointees,&rdquo; the Social Security Administration inspector general said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe FOIA audits have produced some unexpected benefits: pinpointing inefficiencies surrounding the request process. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Energy Department watchdog found that it should streamline FOIA requests, formalize a policy for handling requests, and consistently price materials supplied by the department. Last year, DOE collected barely $14,000 in FOIA fees from requesters while running up more than $4.7 million in costs, which the watchdog described as &ldquo;an exceptionally low rate&rdquo; of cost recovery.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother finding:&nbsp; DOE last year took an average 83 days to fulfill FOIA requests &ndash; way above the 20-day deadline set by law &ndash; in part because the department has not fully adopted electronic processing of requests, the inspector general said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> ABOUT THE DATA:</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>What:</strong>&nbsp; Reports by 29 federal government inspectors general who are reviewing FOIA procedures for any politicization.<br />\r\n\t<strong>Where:</strong> Requested by Rep.

Not all ads mentioning candidates turn up in the FEC database--the Emergency Committee for Israel, for example, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0710/39613.html\">ran ads</a> attacking the record of Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pa., after he defeated incumbent Arlen Spector to secure the Democratic nomination for the Senate. Because the ads, which aired in the middle of July, came after the primary ended but more than 60 days before the general election, the FEC has no record of the ads.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMost of the spending so far has gone towards hot primary races earlier this year, following the same pattern as organizations that explicitly support or oppose a specific candidate. For instance, the Arkansas Democratic primary race between incumbent Blanche Lincoln and Bill Halter &ndash; the state&rsquo;s Lieutenant Governor running for the Senate seat &ndash; saw more than $3.8 million spent followed by the Massachusetts ($2.2 million) and California ($1.5 million) Senate races.

And some of the biggest spenders are Republican and Democratic party committees not affected by the court decisions. But there are more than thirty political organizations that have filed documents with the FEC declaring their intention to receive unlimited contributions from any source to influence the 2010 mid-term elections.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo track all these independent expenditures, and the groups that make them, in real time the Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group is releasing a new tool to <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/independent-expenditures/\">Follow the Unlimited Money</a>, available on our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightlabs.com/independent-expenditures/\"><font class=\"Apple-style-span\" color=\"#339999\">home page</font></a>&nbsp;now. The tool allows users to search independent expenditure filings by organization, candidate and race.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough so far there is no indication that money from corporations is flowing to influence an election in FEC reports, there is a spike in spending by labor unions. Overall, among the top four organizations making independent expenditures are two labor unions, the <a href=\"../../../../independent-expenditures/committee/service-employees-international-union\">Service Employees International Union </a>($7.2 million) and the <a href=\"../../../../independent-expenditures/committee/american-fedn-of-stcntymunic-employees\">American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees</a> ($5.8 million). <a>In 2006</a> these two labor unions spent only $303,000 and $4.5 million respectively, though they did contribute millions more to other political organizations that focused on federal candidates.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA pair of party committees--the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee--round out the top four.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDuring the same nine-month period from January to September in 2006, the last mid-term election, outside groups spent $35.3 million, according to an official with the FEC--far less than the $57 million in 2010. And with more than five weeks to go before the mid-term elections, independent expenditures will likely run that total much higher.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo far, leadership PACs and official party committees like the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee have been among the top spenders in some races around the country--the sources and amounts of the contributions these organizations can take are limited by federal election law.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOutside groups have focused their spending on close races. For instance, the <a href=\"/independent-expenditures/race\">Arkansas Senate</a> race involving incumbent <a href=\"/independent-expenditures/candidate/blanche-lincoln\">Blanche Lincoln</a> and challenger <a href=\"/independent-expenditures/candidate/bill-halter\">Bill Halter</a> in the primary and Republican nominee <a href=\"/independent-expenditures/candidate/john-boozman\">John Boozman</a>,&nbsp;has seen the greatest amount of independent money spent so far at just under $8 million. Halter, the state&rsquo;s Lieutenant Governor, forced Lincoln into a runoff when neither candidate won 50 percent of the vote in the primary. Outside groups, including SEIU and Working America, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO, spent more than $4 million spent to support Halter.&nbsp;Labor unions also spent $2.3 million on ads opposing Lincoln. Despite the substantial amount spent in his favor, Lincoln defeated Halter.</p>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/visualizations/02519a72c51711df95a3000255111976/comments/0257bb96c51711df95a3000255111976.js?width=425&height=350\"></script><p>\r\n\tThe<a href=\"/independent-expenditures/race/CO-Senate\"> Colorado Senate race</a> pitting Democratic incumbent <a href=\"/independent-expenditures/candidate/michael-f-bennet\">Michael Bennet </a>against the tea party-supported Republican nominee, <a href=\"/independent-expenditures/candidate/ken-buck\">Ken Buck,</a> has also drawn substantial attention, ranking fourth among elections with the most outside spending.

These groups that have popped up around the country are raising and spending tens of millions [LINK TO MAIN STORY] of dollars this election cycle in ways that are unfamiliar to elections in recent history.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to a Reporting Group analysis of Federal Election Commission reports, during this election cycle, independent organizations and political groups have spent $67 million so far. And in many cases these groups are not mandated to disclose where the money comes from.&nbsp;&nbsp; A small portion of these of organizations -- the IE-only committees specifically -- are created solely for the purpose of aiding or derailing a candidate&rsquo;s election in various ways including running ads, making phone calls and distributing flyers. We have a spotlight on two such groups that are spending significantly in 2010.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWomen Vote! is a left-leaning group formed by Emily&#39;s List, an established political action committee founded in 1985 by Ellen Malcolm who departed from the organization in early 2010. Malcolm is a Washington insider and activist who uses her knowledge of politics to raise money and help democratic, prochoice women get elected to public office. This cycle, Women Vote has spent more than $756,000 to support and oppose varying candidates.&nbsp;&nbsp; The group is closely connected to Emily&rsquo;s List and shares many of the same donors. Of Women Vote&rsquo;s 28 top contributors, at least 24 people have also given to Emily&rsquo;s List, according to research done with the assistance of LilSis.org.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFred Eychaner, the groups largest donor at $175,000, while not a contributor to Emily&rsquo;s list, comes with other powerful connections. He served on the Olympics 2016 Committee to bring the games to Chicago with Valerie Jarrett, a senior advisor to the White House.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWomen Vote has only received a bit more than $1 million in contributions this year, but has two months left to both spend money and receive donations. Terri Sewell has benefited the most from the group, having had $136,000 spent to aid her as she runs for congress in Alabama. Women Vote has also spent money supporting Robin Carnahan of Missouri and Ann Mclane Kuster of New Hampshire. The liberal group has spent more than $590,000 to ruin the chances of winning for Joe Heck of Nevada, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Cory Gardner of Colorado.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe other side of the political aisle has American Crossroads supporting it, a group formed by Karl Rove. It is supporting republican candidates and holding about $5 million in its coffers to spend between now and Election Day. That group&rsquo;s biggest donors are obscure corporate conglomerates donating, in some cases, a million dollars at a time. Dixie Rice Agricultural Company, for example, gave $1 million to the conservative-backing independent expenditure-only group in July. The corporation&rsquo;s owner is Harold Simmons, a billionaire from Texas who personally makes the top 100 list of individual contributors this cycle, along with Fred Eychaner, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Eychaner is the seventh greatest contributor, while Simmons ranks 38th.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAmerican Crossroads has spent a total of $1.3 million so far supporting Rob Portman of Ohio and opposing Robin Carnahan of Missouri and Michael Bennet of Colorado.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ties that Women Vote has to the candidates it supports and the great amount of money American Crossroads has at its disposal call into question how possible it is for the campaign finance world to remain an even playing field. Terri Sewell, for example, has the support of Emily&rsquo;s List and has received almost $190,000 in campaign contributions from the PAC in addition to the money Women Vote has spent on her behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe New York Times recently reported on the Tea Party support Christine McDonnell of Delaware received that aided in her winning a republican House nomination. The article highlights how Sal Russo, a chief strategist behind the Tea Party Express, is actually a political operative pouring money into what people think is a grass-roots organization. It is suggested that he is doing so in coordination with McDonnell&rsquo;s campaign, which violates the main stipulation that makes unlimited spending possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe rulings in the Speechnow.org v. FEC and the Citizens United v. The Supreme Court cases paved the way for this new spending behavior. The 5-4 ruling in favor of Citizens United reversed a provision of the McCain-Feingold act that prohibited any electioneering communication&mdash;defined as advertising via broadcast, cable or satellite that is paid for by corporations or labor unions. Corporations, labor unions and other groups can now spend as they please to promote or oppose candidates, once again, as long as it is uncoordinated with any candidate. The SpeechNow case took that decision a step further by making it possible for independent groups to receive unlimited amounts for the purpose of furthering their political agendas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2010-09-21 19:07:47", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "tracking-spending-grassroots-groups", "tags": "Super PAC, Super PACs", "is_published": false}}, {"pk": 2215, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-09-21 17:08:16", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 10, "timestamp": "2010-09-20 15:31:10", "image": "", "title": "AP report highlights lack of disclosure in campaign finance world", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tA <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j-dQDLlzbE8XL3nulcfFnPTI53YwD9IBOOPO2\">report put out by the Asoociated Press today</a> highlights the lack of disclosure of money spent to influence mid-term elections. &nbsp;The story highlights the successful fundraising efforts by American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, two Republican-leaning organizations created by top Bush administration advisors, and notes that the two groups raised $14.5 million combined in one 30-day period that ended on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut that information can&#39;t be verified.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe information is said to have been made available to the AP; it is not filed on any official disclosure.

The feedback &ndash; which is usually dominated by lobbyists and industry-backed groups &ndash; is then typically analyzed by an agency before it finalizes a regulation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOpen government advocates agree that the rulemaking process is far more open than years ago, when individuals had to physically visit an agency&rsquo;s reading room to get a look at public comments. However, as the two-year anniversary of an <a href=\"http://ceri.law.cornell.edu/\">American Bar Association-led report</a> recommending improvements comes up in October, tracking federal regulations remains difficult for ordinary Americans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&ldquo;I think they have made baby steps,&rdquo; said Jerry Brito, who runs <a href=\"http://www.openregs.com/\">OpenRegs.com</a> and teaches at George Mason University in Virginia. Brito was speaking specifically of <a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov/\">Regulations.gov</a>, the primary vehicle used by federal agencies to collect public comments on proposed rules.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEspecially compared to the average website, Regulations.gov is difficult to use and the regulations hard to understand, Brito said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, Brito also praised the federal government for bringing almost all agencies under the Regulations.gov umbrella and upgrading the user interface, as well as adding several Web 2.0 tools. Those steps are not easy ones because individual agencies have their own systems and agendas, he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got all this bureaucracy in all these different agencies.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe main overseer of Regulations.gov is the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Office of Information Collection. Andrew Battin, acting director of that office, said the government-wide website has instituted a number of reforms. Those include adding RSS feeds and social media tools, among other changes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, Battin says he reviews public complaints and suggestions about the usability of the site at Regulations.gov/exchange.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe 2008 comprehensive report, called &ldquo;Achieving the Potential: The Future of Federal e-Rulemaking,&rdquo; called for a number of reforms, including making the site more user-friendly. One of its co-authors, Cornell University law professor Cynthia Farina, said most regulations require a graduate school reading level. Proposed regulations are typically written in dense language that makes it difficult for ordinary Americans to determine if the government plan will affect their lives, she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo help consumers, Farina recently started a website called <a href=\"http://regulationroom.org/\">regulationroom.org</a>, which translates notable regulations into plain English and solicits feedback. She has initially partnered with the Department of Transportation to feature its proposed rules, and the site includes basic summaries and easy ways to give feedback.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFarina and other advocates are concerned that Regulations.gov is funded by the agencies themselves. The more an individual agency uses the site &ndash; such as providing more information to the public &ndash; the more the agency pays. This creates a &ldquo;perverse incentive,&rdquo; said Matt Madia, a regulatory policy analyst at the advocacy group OMB Watch.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother official overseeing of Regulations.gov says many of the recommendations from the report have already been adopted, and more will be soon. John Moses, the director of collection strategies at EPA, says a big change coming in 2011 is a uniform numbering system, which will make it easier to use data &ldquo;from agency to agency.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBattin said he thought all of the report&rsquo;s recommendations would be implemented by 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEPA officials said the amount each agency contributes to Regulations.gov is capped at $1 million and that the payment system, to date, has worked well because agencies are invested in the site&rsquo;s success.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>ABOUT THE DATA</b><br />\r\n\t<b>What:</b> Federal government rulemaking proceedings.<br />\r\n\t<b>Where:</b> <a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov/\">www.Regulations.gov</a><br />\r\n\t<b>Availability:</b> Online<br />\r\n\t<b>Usability:</b> Regulations.gov is the central website for federal agencies to post new rules and receive feedback, but critics say it needs to be improved to truly engage the public.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSend your tips on government data sets that you think should be made more accessible or user-friendly to <a href=\"mailto:datamine@publicintegrity.org\">datamine@publicintegrity.org</a>.

Also note that at times a single electioneering report filed lists multiple candidates featured in an ad and these have been listed separately.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Reporting Group has been <a href=\"../../../../independent-expenditures/stories/\">following closely</a> the new developments in campaign finance in the post-Citizens United and SpeechNow world on the state level and the federal level. Citizens United opened the doors for corporations and labor unions to spend freely in support or in opposition to any candidate or issue as long as the spending is done independently of a campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis led to <a href=\"../../../../2010/fec-approves-new-committee/\">political groups asking for permission</a> from the FEC to receive unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations and labor unions and political groups were given the ability to receive unlimited contributions as long as they spent the money independent of candidate, giving rise to a quite of a few political organizations filing as &quot;independent expenditure only&quot; committees.

Using data submitted to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS), the Consumers Union <a href=\"http://www.consumerreports.org/health/doctors-hospitals/surgeon-ratings/ratings-of-bypass-surgeons.htm\">has graded various heart surgery groups </a>using a three-star scale, similar to the way it rates radios, cameras and washing machines. It&#39;s a set of valuable public data that could serve as a model for expanding the Department of Health and Human Services&#39; open government sites like <a href=\"http://data.medicare.gov\">Data.medicare.gov</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/chdi.htm\">Community Health Data Initiative</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe heart surgery ratings are based on factors like survival rates, complications and the use of particular surgical techniques. The information, which has been collected in a registry by the STS since 1989, comes from patients&#39; charts and is available for 90 percent of cardiac surgery programs in the US, although only about 20 percent of those programs have elected to make their data public through Consumer Reports.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> <a href=\"http://healthpolicyandreform.nejm.org/?p=12519\">called the report</a> &quot;a watershed event in health care accountability,&quot; and although the information has been voluntarily reported, and therefore isn&#39;t complete, the <em>Journal</em> notes that the participating physicians have praised the methods of this study. The data has been risk-adjusted, meaning it takes into account complicating factors like the severity of a patient&#39;s disease and any other health conditions they may have. Without proper risk adjustment, physicians fear they could be penalized for taking on more dire cases.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSuch specific and well-documented clinical outcomes are difficult to come by. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) collects quality data voluntarily from physicians for its <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/PQRI/01_Overview.asp#TopOfPage\">Physician Quality Reporting Initiative</a>. The PQRI rewards providers with bonuses for reporting <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/PQRI/Downloads/2010_PQRI_MeasuresList_111309.pdf\">certain quality measures</a>, such as the percentage of their asthmatic patients who receive one of CMS&#39; preferred inhaler types. But the results of these surveys aren&#39;t available to the public. And for good reason, CMS representatives say -- the statistics aren&#39;t risk-adjusted and are only reported by some doctors. As the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> article noted, it took a &quot;long, complex and expensive&quot; process to bring this data into the public realm.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStill, the public could benefit from more transparency when it comes to their health, and it doesn&#39;t get much more user-friendly than Consumer Reports-style ratings. The Department of Health and Human Services already allows patients to compare <a href=\"http://data.medicare.gov/dataset/Hospital-Outcome-Of-Care-Measures/f24z-mvb9\">hospitals</a> and <a href=\"http://data.medicare.gov/#type=popular&amp;tag=nursing%20home\">nursing homes</a> (as we <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/medicare-data-reveals-nursing-home-abuse-and-neglect/\">wrote about</a> earlier<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/medicare-data-shows-trouble-spots-nursing-homes/\"> this year</a>) on various quality measures.

Bart Gordon, D-Tenn., has represented the sixth district of Tennessee, rising to become the chairman of the House Science Committee. Now he is retiring, but he is planning to leave his likeness behind in the committee room, in the form of an official portrait paid for by corporate donors such as Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, and Northrop Grumman, which are also<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cid=N00003126&amp;cycle=2010&amp;type=I&amp;newMem=N&amp;recs=100\"> top contributors </a>to his campaign fund. These companies have contributed a total of $34,000 to the portrait fund.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnother lawmaker, House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson, D-Minn., who is slated for an easy win in the midterms is also raising money for an official portrait, with his <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cid=N00003126&amp;cycle=2010&amp;type=C&amp;newMem=N&amp;recs=100\">top campaign donor</a>, Monsanto, helping finance the cost.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut information about donations made for these portraits is not always publicly available. A nonprofit set up by Congress, the<a href=\"http://www.uschs.org/Content/20.htm\"> U.S. Capitol Historical Society</a>, which is in charge of recording the history of Congress and the Capitol building, accepts donations on behalf of lawmakers. Making donations to this nonprofit also gives donors an additional incentive in the form of a tax deduction. And while there are limits on how much these donors may give to a congressional campaign, there are none on what they may contribute for these portrait funds.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor this article, the Reporting Group used some of the information available in lobbying contributions records known as<a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=lobbyistselectfields\"> LD-203&nbsp; </a>and in FEC <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/expendetail.php?cid=N00003126&amp;cycle=2010&amp;name=US%20Capitol%20Historical%20Society\">campaign expenditure records </a>from Center for Responsive Politics. Sometimes information is missing or is reported in a way that is difficult to trace.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn Rep. Gordon&#39;s case, lobbying disclosure forms filed this year show a series of payments to the Capitol Historical Society on his behalf from Nissan North America ($5,000), AT&amp;T ($5,000), Microsoft ($5,000), and Bridgestone ($2,500). Campaign finance records, meanwhile, show his campaign contributed two payments totaling $20,500 (although only one of those is listed as being for a &quot;portrait,&quot; the other as a &quot;donation.&quot;)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, when asked, his committee office<a href=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/BartGordonPortraitCmte.pdf\"> provided</a> the Sunlight Foundation with a complete list of payments that included several that do not show up on lobbying disclosure records, including contributions from Lockheed Martin ($2,500), Northrop Grumman ($5,000), and Raytheon ($5,000). The total amount collected for the portrait, according to his committee office, was $55,500 and expenses to date are just over $34,000.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAll but one of the donors, Nissan North America, that have contributed to the portrait fund are also <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cid=N00003126&amp;cycle=2010&amp;type=I&amp;newMem=N&amp;recs=100\">top donors</a> to Gordon&#39;s campaign fund this election cycle. And AT&amp;T&#39;s PAC hosted a <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/party/10929/\">fundraiser</a> for the congressman in 2009 at the Capitol Hill eatery Johnny&#39;s Half Shell.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the case of Rep. Peterson, Monsanto and a lobbying firm, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?lname=Russell+%26+Barron%2C+Inc&amp;year=2010\">Russell &amp; Barron</a>, which counts the chemical company as a client, paid a total of $6,000 toward a portrait this year, according to lobbying disclosure records. The company is presently lobbying, among other issues, on the deregulation of Roundup ready alfalfa. Peterson was <a href=\"http://hayandforage.com/hay/alfalfa/congressmen-ask-for-rr-alfalfa-planting-0721/index.html\">one of 75 Congressman</a> to sign a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack this summer asking the agency to allow Roundup ready alfalfa seeds, which were developed by Monsanto, to be planted this fall, according to a report in Hay &amp; Forage Grower.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBarton and Peterson join the ranks of several other House committee chairmen<strong> </strong>over the years whose visages have been preserved for posterity thanks to donors who also often are generous contributors to their campaigns.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe checks are written for specific portrait committees<a href=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/BartGordonPortraitCmte.pdf\"> typically run by a friend</a> of the lawmaker&#39;s. In Gordon&#39;s case, it is his former committee&nbsp; chief of staff, Chuck Atkins. Candidates&#39; campaign funds and leadership PACs may also contribute to these portrait committees. Any funds leftover after the costs of a portrait are paid go to the Society, which <a href=\"http://www.uschs.org/Content/69.htm\">conducts</a> educational tours, symposia, and sells momentos and publications on the Capitol.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;We provide an accounting function,&quot; said&nbsp; Ronald Sarasin, president of the Society. <a href=\"http://www.stennis.gov/congressionalbio/congressionalbio_show.htm?doc_id=745608\">Sarasin</a> is a former GOP member of Congress from Connecticut, and later served as a lobbyist for the National Restaurant Association and then president of the National Beer Wholesalers Association before joining the Society.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Society does not make any records about the portrait committees available to the public nor are they public elsewhere and hence impossible to tell how many lawmakers have a portrait fund or who contributes to the funds.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/issues/55_91/news/43390-1.html?type=printer_friendly\">investigation</a> by Roll Call earlier this year (subscription required) found that some half a dozen lawmakers had set up portrait funds with the Society from 2004 through 2009, including Reps. John Boehner, R., Ohio; Vernon Ehlers, R., Mich.; Jerry Lewis, R., Calif.; and Don Manzullo, R., Ill.; David Obey, D.

It&#39;s just not laid out in a computer-friendly way.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCurrently, spending information is available in PDF format. It isn&#39;t searchable by vendor name or spending type, and isn&#39;t downloadable in any machine-readable format. And it&#39;s updated quarterly.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt&#39;s easy to see why the site falls short. Like other state spending sites, Tennessee&#39;s Opengov was created by an eager governor but has been starved of dedicated funding in these tough economic times.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSince the page was first launched in May of 2009, no employees have been dedicated specifically to the project either. Lola Potter with the Tennessee Department of Finance and Administration defended the lack of staff, saying that making do with less is what state governments do best. Still, she said, we&#39;ll have to wait until more funds roll in before we&#39;ll see some of the most important items on her wishlist: real-time (or nearly real-time) updates and downloadable data.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to Potter, transparency in government has been a major priority for Governor Phil Bredesen, but the state simply hasn&#39;t had the funds to upgrade so far. &quot;Our understanding is the software [that&#39;s required to put out real-time accounting data] is quite expensive, so that&#39;s not going to happen until at least 2012,&quot; she said. And margins are thin throughout the Tennessee government. Agencies have reduced their budgets by an average of 21 percent, Potter said, and $1.2 billion has been cut from the state budget over a two-year period.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Downloadability:</strong> Information is in PDF format.

Currently, most consumer complaints about a safety issue remain confidential unless the CPSC decides that a recall is merited.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&ldquo;This will really beef up research and data we have on public safety,&rdquo; says Nancy Cowles of Kids In Danger, a child protection group. The database, which Congress mandated in a 2008 law, will let consumers search for information by product name, type of harm, or manufacturer. It will also make it harder for companies to hide complaints about faulty products, Cowles said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWithin 5 days of receiving a consumer complaint, the CPSC must share the report with the manufacturer of the product, according to the law mandating the new database. The company has 10 days to try to block publication of the complaint in the database by persuading the agency that the information is wrong or requires protection as a trade secret, or it can submit a comment to attach to the complaint in the database.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat kind of consumer complaints are the agency expecting? Scott Wolfson, CPSC director of public affairs, cites an example of a baby crib in which its drop side fails in the middle of the night, trapping the infant. Whether a close call or an actual tragedy, the baby&rsquo;s family will be able to immediately alert the CPSC &mdash; and other parents &mdash; of the problem. &ldquo;The sooner it&rsquo;s on the database, the faster we can take action and other consumers who have the same product will be made aware of the situation,&rdquo; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndustry groups have lodged their own complaints with the CPSC about the new database, saying they fear false accusations about harmful products will hurt company reputations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&ldquo;In the age of the Internet and 24-hour news, information can spread in a moment&#39;s time around the world. There is a danger that inaccurate information regarding a consumer product can irreversibly damage the reputation of a company and the sales of its product,&rdquo; Cary Silverman, a lawyer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce&rsquo;s Institute for Legal Reform,&nbsp; told the agency&rsquo;s public hearing last November.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor example, a consumer entering an online complaint could inadvertently misspell the name of the manufacturer, Silverman said, or submit false information to pressure a company into settling a product liability lawsuit. And there is also the risk that a competing manufacturer could deliberately make up a false complaint to tarnish a rival&rsquo;s reputation, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWerner Co., a Pennsylvania-based ladder maker, urged the CPSC to give manufacturers a longer, 60-day deadline to respond to a consumer complaint and to automatically delete from the database all consumer complaints after five years if they do not result in a recall. Michigan engineering consultants, Exponent Failure Analysis Associates, expressed concern that individual complaints could be circulated via popular social networking sites, prompting many others to file false complaints.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tConsumer advocacy groups say the database will save lives by encouraging the speedy removal or redesign of unsafe products. The new trove of information will also help the agency spot trends and emerging problems, they say.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe CPSC is now reviewing public comments about its proposal to set up the database, and is expected to issue a final regulation this fall. The final regulations will also determine if the database will include consumer complaints prior to March 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&ldquo;We want this database to succeed.&nbsp; When we turn this on, we want it to work well for consumers,&rdquo; Wolfson said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tABOUT THE DATA:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>What:&nbsp;</strong> Database of consumer complaints about harmful or dangerous products submitted to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.<br />\r\n\t<strong>Where:</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.saferproducts.gov/\">www.SaferProducts.gov</a><br />\r\n\t<strong>Availability:</strong> Beginning March 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<strong>Usability:&nbsp;</strong> Searchable, but not yet clear if database will include consumer complaints submitted prior to its March 11, 2011 launch<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSend your tips on government data sets that you think should be made more accessible or user-friendly to datamine@publicintegrity.org.

The Senate, on the other hand, is moving at a glacial pace and has yet to offer details about its plan to start publishing expense reports online in 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEach U.S. lawmaker gets an annual allowance of between $1.3 million and $4.5 million to operate their offices, pay staff, buy equipment and supplies, and pay for travel. The amount varies according to whether a lawmaker is a member of the House or Senate, and how far away his or her home state is from Washington. Until recently, taxpayers could examine the expense reports only by visiting the basement of a Congressional office building in Washington, or appearing in person at a handful of federal libraries across the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn June 2009, following an outcry in Britain over Parliamentarians&rsquo; expenses, Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered the House chief administrative officer to begin publishing online the chamber&rsquo;s expense reports. The so-called Statement of Disbursements is a quarterly document that captures spending by House lawmakers and staff in three volumes totaling some 3,000 pages. But the data is difficult for taxpayers to analyze because spending is reported in inconsistent ways by House lawmakers and entries are not always clear about where the money went.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&ldquo;It falls short of many transparency standards that advocates and the general public expect from governmental entities today,&rdquo; says Peter Sepp, vice president of the National Taxpayer Union (NTU).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor example, the House allowances and office spending totals are listed in separate volumes.&nbsp; To compare them requires entering data by hand for all of the chamber&rsquo;s 440 lawmakers, Sepp said, including the 5 nonvoting representatives.&nbsp; For taxpayer watchdog organizations like the NTU and LegiStorm, the only way to make the data usable for comparison and analyses is by hiring workers to manually enter it.&nbsp; The NTU wants the House to make the data available in a searchable database and to improve the detail and accuracy required in reporting expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKarissa Marcum, who works for the House chief administrative officer, attributes the reporting inconsistencies to complicated government accounting.&nbsp; &ldquo;The online version is generated via a process that more strictly applies the use of standard government accounting codes, similar to those used by the executive branch,&rdquo; says Marcum.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDespite the problems with the House expense reports, that chamber is still far ahead of the Senate. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCurrently, the only way to access the Senate&rsquo;s twice-yearly expense report is by leafing through the hardcopy volumes in the Senate&rsquo;s Hart office building on Capitol Hill or by visiting one of a few Federal Depository Libraries. &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t have easy access to these libraries, they don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s there, and they don&rsquo;t know how to look it up,&rdquo; said Jock Friedly of LegiStorm.&nbsp; Each biannual Senate records contain about 2,000 pages in two volumes. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn amendment attached to an annual spending bill last year requires the Senate to begub posting expense reports on the web in a searchable, itemized format.&nbsp; The Secretary of the Senate will make the reports available online for the next full reporting period of April-September in 2011, but offered few details of current progress or reporting requirements. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSurprisingly, the Senate may have less to hide. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&ldquo;The Senate may actually have some less egregious patterns of expenditures than the House,&rdquo; Sepp said. &ldquo;Franked mail is limited much more tightly on the Senate side.

The same goes for electioneering communications: Groups have been reporting this activity since the enactment of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, but the range of organizations that may make these disbursements is now wider.&rdquo;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tGroups spending more than $10,000 20 days or more before an election and $1,000 within 19 days of the election on independent expenditures must disclose financial details to the FEC the same day the information is released. Groups spending at least $10,000 on electioneering communications are also required by the FEC to disclose those actions the same day the information is distributed no matter when the spending occurs. The FEC is working to turn the information around as soon as possible by providing automated entry forms for political groups or digitizing information quickly if submitted in hand written form. The longest it could be before any information is available online is two days, and that is if data is received on a weekend.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tThis is promising news for people interested in following the money behind campaign ads.

Total dollars spent lobbying on health care issues remained high in the three months after the reform bill was passed, dipping by only $16 million since the first quarter of the year.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tState insurance commissioners are currently working out the details that will shape one of the first regulatory battles of health care reform: what percent of premiums health insurers must spend on patient care. And the health care industry is taking note. In the second quarter of 2010, more than 40 organizations lobbied Congress, the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services on this issue.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe new law requires large insurance plans to spend a minimum of 85 cents of every dollar on medical care, as opposed to administrative and other costs, such as advertising, employee salaries and profit. Small group and individual plans must meet a lower standard - 80 cents on the dollar. It&#39;s called the &quot;medical loss ratio&quot; in industry jargon.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile the basic rates were set by the law, the details that are currently being worked out can have a significant effect on insurance companies&#39; bottom lines. At issue is how liberally to interpret the concept of patient care. For example, will fraud detection efforts be considered patient care? How about nurse hotlines? Which federal taxes will insurers be <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2010/08/12/health-care-overhaul-nitty-gritty-the-medical-loss-ratio-and-taxes/\">allowed to deduct</a> from their revenues, thus boosting their numbers?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLobbying disclosure forms often list dozens of issues, so it is difficult to parse out how much was spent on an individual provision. But over $10 million was reported last quarter on forms that list the medical loss ratio as at least one of the issues discussed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGroups that lobbied ranged from large health insurers to physicians&#39; and hospital groups and online plan brokers; industry groups vastly outnumbered consumer advocacy groups. Out of the 41 groups that lobbied on medical loss ratios and the health care reform bill, only two were patient advocacy groups.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAmong the most aggressive in its lobbying efforts was WellPoint, the second largest health insurance company in the nation according to <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2010/industries/223/index.html\">Fortune Magazine</a>. Last quarter, WellPoint spent $1.25 million lobbying on health issues, down only slightly from $1.5 million in the first three months of the year. During that same period, WellPoint&#39;s own overall medical loss ratio was <a href=\"http://www.ibj.com/article/print?articleId=21353\">82.9 percent</a> &ndash; that is, 82.9 cents of every patient dollar were spent on medical care.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWellPoint was the center of a storm of protest earlier this year when a division of the company proposed <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wellpoint-division-raked-over-insurance-rate-hike-2010-02-10\">30 to 39 percent rate hikes</a> in California, shortly after the insurer posted an increase in profits of <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wellpoint-faces-firestorm-over-profits-2010-02-10\">over 700 percent</a>. That windfall was largely due to the sale of a subsidiary, but nonetheless drew criticism from consumer advocates as well as investigations by federal and state oversight groups in the wake of the proposed rate hikes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBased on 2009 numbers, it looks as though insurers will have the toughest time bringing their individual plans up to par. Last year, according to a <a href=\"http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/docs/2010/MLR-Report.pdf\">Senate Commerce Committee analysis</a>, the average individual plan at the six largest for-profit companies had a medical loss ratio of 73.6 percent. Small and large-group plans, on average, just barely met the new minimums.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAmong WellPoint&#39;s subsidiaries, the numbers vary widely. Anthem Health Plans of Maine was sitting pretty last year at 95.2 percent for their individual plans. But elsewhere, WellPoint subsidiaries fell far short of the new requirements: the New Hampshire Anthem group came in at 62.9 percent last year for individual plans and the Virginia Anthem group posted a 66.6 percent medical loss ratio in their small-group plan.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf insurers can&#39;t make the minimum medical loss ratios, they&#39;ll have to refund a portion of premiums to patients. Health Care for America Now (HCAN), a liberal nonprofit that supported health care reform, estimates that if the new rule had been in place in 2009, the six largest for-profit health insurance companies would have had to return $1.9 billion to customers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOther large insurers posted lower overall ratios than WellPoint but report fewer lobbying dollars flowing toward the issue. United Health Group, the country&#39;s largest managed-care company, posted an overall ratio of 81.5 percent last quarter. That company spent $920,000 on health care lobbying during that period.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn August 17, state regulators in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners took a first step toward interpreting the rule, approving a new form that insurers will use to report their ratios. The commissioners will issue their final report in the fall, which will be subject to Health and Human Services Department approval. The concept of holding insurance companies to a minimum on patient care isn&#39;t new. Several states currently implement their own<a href=\"http://www.naic.org/documents/committees_lhatf_ahwg_100426_AHIP_MLR_Chart.pdf\"> medical loss ratio minimums</a>, ranging from the lax, such as North Dakota&#39;s 55 percent requirement for individual plans to the more stringent, such as Colorado&#39;s 85 percent minimum for policies with more than 50 holders.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIndustry representatives contend that using a narrow definition of patient care hampers their ability to detect fraud, improve record-keeping technology and may send some insurers out of business. As a consultant to the health care industry told the Wall Street Journal earlier this year, the new standards won&#39;t necessarily help rein in costs, either. Bob Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2010/05/25/news/companies/medical_loss_ratio/index.htm\">told CNN</a> in May that &quot;the easiest way to have a high medical loss ratio is to let your medical costs soar,&quot; thus balancing out high administrative costs.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "date_published": "2010-08-31 12:22:51", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "lobbying-dollars-flow-health-care-reform", "tags": "health care reform, health, lobbying", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2201, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-09-28 10:45:20", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 10, "timestamp": "2010-08-25 15:01:03", "image": "", "title": "Everyone and their plumber forming independent expenditure committees", "excerpt": "", "content": "<div>\r\n\tEveryone&nbsp;wants in on the unlimited fun in this post-Citizens United world.

While candidates and committees in other states have tried slate mailers, they have not achieved the same degree of popularity as the California slate mailers.<br><br>Joel Fox, blogger for the California based political blog, <a href=\"http://www.foxandhoundsdaily.com/\">Fox &amp; Hounds Daily</a>, runs a slate mailer that endorses several candidates. \u201cThe reason that slate mailers are on such a larger scale in California, might be that we have so many more propositions and candidates,\u201d he said. Fox\u2019s slate, the Small Business Action Committee Newsletter, made some revenue from their mailer and put it toward the organization, but Fox insists that the most valuable aspect of their slate mailer is being able to get their message out.<br><br>California has a notable disclosure process for slate mailers through <a href=\"http://cal-access.ss.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/list.aspx?view=slateMailers\">Cal-Access</a>. According to the database, there are 81 active slate mailer organizations registered in the state. Although, unlike Waters\u2019 mailer, most of the names of their organizations are vague and it is difficult to understand who is funding them. Some are misleading. For example, the \u201cOfficial Non-Partisan Voter Guide of California,\u201d \u201cCalifornia Voter Guide,\u201d and \u201cElection Education Guide\u201d all sound like official, non-partisan advice, but are often endorsements for hire.<br><br>According to <a href=\"http://www.politicalscientists.com/slate.pdf\">The Journal of Law and Politics</a>, \u201cIf scholars have given too little attention to campaign mail, they have entirely overlooked the particular phenomenon known in California as \u2018slate mail.\u2019\u201d Although political \u2018slates\u2019 are known in other states typically, they are produced and distributed by the party, on a relatively small scale.<br><br>For this analysis, the Reporting Group used documents collected from state level disclosures, campaign finance data from the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) and additional documents provided by the Federal Elections Commission (FEC).

In this series we're reviewing each state's efforts in this direction.<br><br>This week: Colorado<br>Website: <a href=\"http://tops.state.co.us/\">www.tops.state.co.us</a></i><br><br>File this under \"Valiant attempts.\" When the state of Colorado created the government spending website TOPS (Transparency Online Project) in the fall of 2009, officials dutifully made every piece of data on the site downloadable. Unfortunately, while the idea is laudable, the execution is a little weak. The data is in XML format -- a handy format for computer programmers -- but isn't structured well enough to import neatly into the Excel spreadsheets the rest of us plebeians are familiar with.<br><br>More importantly, the data is downloadable only in tiny slices. You can't look at the Department of Corrections and see at a glance how much was spent by each subagency on each fund and account. Instead, you can only download one level of data -- a few records' worth -- at a time. What researchers could really use is one big download that contains all the expenditure data for that fiscal year.<br><br>According to state controller David McDermott, the site's current bandwidth might not even be able to support such a large download. As is the case with a lot of state spending websites, no dedicated funding was ever provided for TOPS. The controller's office had to use what they had at hand: in-house talent on limited time.<br><br>As for the data itself, so far TOPS only provides two things: expenditures and revenues. On the expenditure side, a reporter wanting to know how much the state spends on species conservation could discover that the Department of Natural Resources paid Hach Company $255 in fiscal year 2010. A quick google search shows the Hach Company makes water quality testing equipment. A little more clarity would be useful -- I'm not sure why there are two species conservation accounts, one called O&amp;M and one called CAP -- but they're on the right track.<br><br>Revenues are structured in the same way, and while the source of fines and fees are considered confidential, they are available through an open records request. So for example, the state took in $55,125 from wildlife use permits in fiscal year 2010, but you can't look up the names of people and organizations that purchased them.<br><br>According to the website, more features will be rolled out eventually, although no promises yet as to what the new features will be.

Kendrick Meek of Florida is seeking to move congressional offices and grab his state&rsquo;s senate seat, and if he wins this Tuesday&rsquo;s primary, he&rsquo;ll be one step closer. In an effort to make that happen, an independent group has come to the aid of Meek&rsquo;s modestly-financed campaign&mdash;relative to his competitors&mdash;and has spent $245,000 placing ads to discredit his opposition, specifically <a href=\"http://www.jeffgreene.com/meet-jeff\">Jeff Greene,</a> a wealthy businessman who has self-financed his run for office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe large amount of money dedicated to running ads is keeping with &nbsp;what is happening in other parts of the country this election cycle. For instance, in the Colorado Senate primary the winner Michael Bennet received help from an independent expenditure committee. The group in that case, League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund, and the group spending for Meek, are both new creations in the campaign finance world post the Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Reporting Group has been <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/fec-approves-new-committee/\">following</a> new independent expenditure committees being set up.

The ads should be a great benefit to Meek, whose total campaign contributions (about $7 million) are half that of Greene&rsquo;s (about $14 million). Greene has taken advantage of his own hearty bank account and loaned his campaign the funds while Meek has received almost all of his campaign funds from contributions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDespite Greene&#39;s abundance of funds, Meek still has a lead according to <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1297.xml?ReleaseID=1487\">recent polls. </a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBen Pollara, who works for<a href=\"http://www.thewolframgroup.com/content/\"> The Wolfram Group,</a> a fundraising firm, is behind the independent expenditure committee spending its money on Meek. In 2008 Pollara raised over $12 million in Florida for Hilary Clinton&rsquo;s presidential bid and could help the Florida congressman win the state&rsquo;s Senate primary.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf Pollara continues to raise and spend money supporting Meek, the candidate will not only be able to spend less time fundraising and more time campaigning, but will also give individuals who want to support Meek a way to do so <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/contriblimits.shtml\">without limits.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before IE committees were approved by the FEC, individuals could only give $5,000 to PACs and $2,400 directly to campaigns.&nbsp;The names of people bankrolling the ad campaign for Meek will likely only be available at the end of September, when the FEC quarterly filings are

Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., a lawmaker who moonlights as a classical pianist, was honored in June along with the likes of the co-writer of Lady Gaga&#39;s &quot;Paparazzi.&quot; The senator was recognized not for his musical abilities, however, but for his support of the music industry. Alexander was the guest of honor at the National Music Publishers Association&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.nmpa.org/media/showrelease.asp?id=177\">annual meeting</a>, an event attended by over 500 songwriters and music publishers -- and one that <a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=fe20ee76-13a7-4f59-8a84-fd8d801b90dd\">cost the organization over $100,000</a> to host, according to the &quot;honararia&quot; section of lobbying records filed with the Senate Office of Public Records.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSen. Alexander, who co-chairs one of the more <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/us/politics/12interests.html\">obscure</a> Senate caucuses -- the <a href=\"http://legislative.nashvillesongwriters.com/news.php?viewStory=61\">Senate Songwriters&#39; Caucus</a> -- has proven an ally for the recording industry in the past. In 2004, he cosponsored the <a href=\"http://legislative.nashvillesongwriters.com/news.php?viewStory=51\">Songwriters Capital Gains Tax Equity Act</a>, the basics of which were eventually enacted in 2006. That law allowed songwriters to pay a lower tax rate on income from their song catalogs. He also cosponsored the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_Equality_and_Remedies_for_Rights_Holders_in_Music_Act_of_2007\">PERFORM Act</a> (Platform Equality and Remedies for Rights Holders in Music), originally introduced in 2006. Had it passed, that bill would have put restrictions on digital and internet radio stations, requiring them to digitally protect the songs they broadcast so that listeners couldn&#39;t download or copy them. The senator has even endeared himself to the music community from the stage, playing at a benefit concert for the Grand Ole Opry.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSen. Alexander is among a select group of legislators handed the NMPA&#39;s President&#39;s Award, which is intended to recognize those who work &quot;diligently to strengthen intellectual property protection.&quot; Past recipients have been a bipartisan mix of Congress members, most of whom are also big favorites of recording industry donors. These include Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who co-sponsored the bill to lower income tax for songwriters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMusic industry groups have boasted in recent years that they have achieved legislative gains without racking up expensive lobbying bills. According to a press release on <a href=\"http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/334803\">music publisher BMI&#39;s website</a>, &ldquo;the Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI) spearheaded [the 2004 bill] with a minimum of lobbying bucks, spending five years putting together relationships with lawmakers in the House and Senate, and convincing them that the change was needed.&rdquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that doesn&#39;t mean money hasn&#39;t changed hands. Sen.

Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., announced that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) had filed a lawsuit, prepared by its counsel, Robert F. Bauer, alleging that Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, was using a series of nonprofits and political committees (called section 527s, after the section of the tax code under which they're created) to circumvent campaign finance laws, extort money from donors, and evade disclosure. Kennedy and Bauer presented the charges, based for the most part on media reports about DeLay's fundraising tactics, as an unprecedented assault on campaign finance law. \"Money laundering,\" Bauer elaborated on one of the main charges, is \"the way in which he avoids public disclosure and washes the fruits of his illegal fundraising operation through these unregistered organizations, which do not disclose the source or object of their expenditures.\"&nbsp;<br><br>A reporter then asked Bauer,&nbsp;<br><br><blockquote>It's not unheard of for either party to make contributions to 501(c)(4)s or 527s. Has the DCCC, in this cycle, made any transfers to any such organizations, either a 501(c)(4) for get-out-the-vote efforts or a 527, and will you be making any for the rest of the year?</blockquote><br>...to which Bauer responded,<br><br><blockquote>Well, the answer to the first question is no. And we haven't even addressed the issue. And I don't know of any circumstance under which we would. And so it's very hard for me to answer the question in the abstract.</blockquote><br>In the third quarter of 2000, the DCCC made a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://forms.irs.gov/politicalOrgsSearch/search/generatePDF.action?formId=%27521572567-8872-0001%27&amp;formType=P72\">$53,000 contribution</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;Impac 2000, a 527<a href=\"http://forms.irs.gov/politicalOrgsSearch/search/generatePDF.action?formId=%27521572567-8871-01%27&amp;formType=P71\">organized</a>&nbsp;to \"formulate, coordinate and implement redistricting efforts.\"&nbsp;Impac 2000 paid more than $7,800 to Perkins Coie, Bauer's law firm, in the same quarter it received money from the DCCC. (Impac 2000 would later&nbsp;<a href=\"http://forms.irs.gov/politicalOrgsSearch/search/generatePDF.action?formId=%27521572567-8872-0003%27&amp;formType=P72\">donate</a>&nbsp;$25,000 to the DCCC; though it is impossible to tell from the disclosures, it is possible that Impac 2000 was transferring \"hard\" money, which could be used with fewer restrictions, to the DCCC in exchange for a larger amount of soft money, use of which faced more restrictions at the federal level.)<br><br>The DCCC also contributed more than&nbsp;<a href=\"http://forms.irs.gov/politicalOrgsSearch/search/generatePDF.action?formId=%27521981307-8872-0003%27&amp;formType=P72\">$14,000</a>&nbsp;to another 527 called the New Democrat Network, which also disclosed making small payments to Perkins Coie. Overall, according to the only&nbsp;<a href=\"http://projects.publicintegrity.org/527/search.aspx?act=main&amp;type=org&amp;donrec=rec&amp;name=perkins%20coie\">available online database</a>&nbsp;of 527 expenditures in the 2000 election cycle, Perkins Coie billed eight 527s -- the others were the Democratic Properties Corporation, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, Majority 2000, Campaign for a Progressive Future, Pro Choice Vote, and the Sierra Club Voter Education Fund -- in the 2000 election cycle.<br><br>Bauer, President Barack Obama's choice to take on some of the responsibilities of Norm Eisen, the special counsel for ethics and government reform who is moving on to become ambassador to the Czech Republic, has occasionally been identified in the press as an \"ethics expert\" or an \"ethics attorney.\" But his expertise has served some unethical characters: while Bauer has attacked the ethics of Tom DeLay and his network of 527s, he's defending those of Tony Coelho (resigned amidst a congressional ethics inquiry) and Robert Torricelli (did not seek reelection amidst a federal investigation). He represented&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/campaign/july97/hearing_7-10.html\">Richard Sullivan</a>, the Democratic National Committee finance director who was involved in a number of the fundraising irregularities in the 1996 election that were investigated by House and Senate Committees.&nbsp;<br><br>Bauer has also used his expertise to help his clients do some of the same things the DCCC accused DeLay of. In 1999, the Washington Post reported on a new wrinkle in campaign finance: members of Congress who had their own 527 committees, allowing them to raise unlimited funds from donors--including unions and corporations, barred from contributing directly to their federal campaigns. The Post noted that at least 20 members of Congress had set up their own soft money operations. While they couldn't use the funds for their federal campaigns, they could spend it on polling or to pay for consultants, donate it to state and local politicians or national party committees, and travel to political events.&nbsp;<br><br>The Internal Revenue Service, which now publishes&nbsp;<a href=\"http://forms.irs.gov/politicalOrgsSearch/search/basicSearch.jsp?ck\">527 filings</a>&nbsp;on its website, didn't require these organizations to disclose their donors until July 2000. Post reporters Susan B. Glasser and Juliet Eilperin reported that some election lawyers advised their clients to provide disclosure at the state level, while others advised against it:<br><blockquote>Some, such as Republican Benjamin Ginsberg of Patton Boggs, say that registering in states such as Virginia is the best way -- in part because it provides at least some disclosure. But Democrat Robert F. Bauer, whose firm, Perkins Coie, advises 15 congressional Democratic leadership PACs (four of which raise soft money), insisted such registration is unnecessary if the intent is to raise soft money on a national level.</blockquote><br>Glasser and Eilperin note that one of the 527s--the Rhode Island PAC--belonged to Rep. Patrick Kennedy. A Kennedy spokesman told the Post reporters that Rhode Island PAC donated \"$70,000 in soft money Kennedy raised went almost entirely to the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\" Bauer did not comment on whether moving money from Kennedy's 527 to the DCCC constituted money laundering.<br><br>", "date_published": "2010-08-13 15:08:41", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "funny-kind-ethics-czar", "tags": "\"Robert F.

The Defense Department has an overall ranking of 7.4 even though a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report earlier this month found that the behemoth of government IT spending has updated some of its projects only five or six times in an entire year. Contrast this frequency with the much smaller Department of Education that has updated its $795 million annual IT investment information anywhere from 16 to over 100 times but is penalized with a ranking of just 5.6. Clearly, standardization is needed to make IT Dashboard an accurate tracking resource, according to the GAO.<br><br>A recent upgrade by the OMB to the IT Dashboard site rectifies some of the problems. \u201cThe train is moving really quick. OMB is quite responsive to [the GAO] recommendations and there are improvements continually happening,\u201d said David Powner, GAO director of information technology. \u201cWe still suggested that OMB report on how that upgrade is actually improving performance.

(See below for a list of registered committees)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to<a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/press/press2010/20100722OpenMtng.shtml\"> two FEC advisories</a>, &ldquo;political committees that intend to make only independent expenditures&hellip;may solicit and accept unlimited contributions from individuals, political committees, corporations and labor organizations for the purpose of making independent expenditures.&rdquo; One of the FEC advisory opinions, which references <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/01/21/citizens_united_transparenc/\">Citizens United</a> but is a response to a circuit court <a href=\"http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/201003/08-5223-1236837.pdf\">ruling</a> involving <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/03/26/latest-from-citizens-united-disclosure-yes-contribution-limits-no/\">Speechnow.org</a>, ruled that a group called Commonsense Ten can receive and spend unlimited amounts from all but a narrow category of prohibited sources--foreign nationals, federal contractors, national banks and corporations created by Congress.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn FEC spokesperson, Julia Queen, said that while the agency hasn&rsquo;t had a chance to establish complete rules for independent expenditure committees yet, groups should use what is written in the advisory opinions as a guideline.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to Queen, the only thing the new committees must do is file a registration form and submit a letter of intent that states it will only make independent expenditures. It seems that the seven groups already registered as IE committees are disclosing expenditures, including how much they&#39;ve spent, who it was paid to and which candidate the money is intended to support or oppose. They are filing <a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/pdf/787/10931084787/10931084787.pdf#navpanes=0\">these forms</a> within 24 or 48 hours of the money being spent, similar to electioneering reports. &nbsp;(See below for a list of IE committees and links to forms files on the FEC website.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCurrently there is no way to tell who is funding the committees because there are no specific disclosure rules in place yet. It&#39;s also unclear how this will be addressed in the future. However, in the case of the group supporting Bennet, the time span between the group forming and it making expenditures is so short it&rsquo;s likely that the group&rsquo;s money came from its founder, the League of Conservation Voters. If by chance the FEC establishes rules similar to what already exists for other political committees, then <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm5.pdf\">reporting might take place on a quarterly basis</a>, with the frequency of reporting increasing closer to election day.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOther groups to file as independent expenditure committees include a Nevada-based group called Americans for New Leadership, organized to oppose Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev. According to their <a href=\"http://www.americansfornewleadership.com/\">website,</a>&nbsp;the group is, &ldquo;dedicated to doing [their] part to help by letting every single Nevadan know what damage Harry has done to our State and our Country.&rdquo; In an effort to carry out their mission they&rsquo;ve put together a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fyqq1jQ44nA&amp;feature=player_embedded\">video</a> that supports Republican challenger Sharon Angle while attacking Reid for one of his campaign ads. The end of the video states in writing that the video was not authorized, nor paid for, by any candidate. Records kept by the FEC show that the group has <a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00485821/485624/se\">spent $37,000</a> this year independent of any candidate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis development in the campaign finance world takes the issue of spending limits a step further than the Citizens United ruling did. The outcome of the Supreme Court case enables corporations to spend freely on their own accord in support of or opposition to candidates.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group will continue to follow these committees and monitor the FEC for rules created.</p>\r\n<table cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"5\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"20%\">\r\n\t\t\t\tCommittee ID</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"50%\">\r\n\t\t\t\tCommittee Name</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"30%\">\r\n\t\t\t\tFEC link containing forms filed by the Committee</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tC00482620</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tARIZONANS WORKING TOGETHER</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00482620\" title=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00482620\">Link</a></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tC00484295</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tCALIFORNIANS FOR FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00484295\" title=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00484295\">Link</a></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tC00484642</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tCOMMONSENSE TEN</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00484642\" title=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00484642\">Link</a></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tC00485821</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tAMERICANS FOR NEW LEADERSHIP</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00485821\" title=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00485821\">Link</a></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tC00486845</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tLEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS VICTORY FUND</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00486845\" title=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00486845\">Link</a></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tC00486878</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tPEOPLE&#39;S MAJORITY</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tNo data available online yet</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tC00486688</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tFLORIDA IS NOT FOR SALE</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00486688\" title=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00486688\">Link</a></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>", "date_published": "2010-08-11 14:37:33", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "fec-approves-new-committee", "tags": "speechnow.org, Independent expenditures, Campaign finance, harry reid, Nevada, Federal elections commission, FEC", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2182, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-08-23 12:56:59", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 12, "timestamp": "2010-08-09 17:43:56", "image": "", "title": "States of Transparency: Alaska", "excerpt": "", "content": "<i>The Open Government\r\nDirective encouraged states to put valuable government data online.

If, however, incumbents lose at the same rate as in 1994\u2014which entails numerous other factors that will be revisited in later posts\u2014Democrats would be in serious trouble, losing between 46 and 51 seats and their majority.<br><br>House Democrats are on pace to have more incumbents and incumbent party candidates pass a key threshold in fundraising to help their electoral prospects come November: when incumbents raise more than 70 percent of the contributions in their race, they rarely lose an election, even in wave elections. <br><br>We analyzed campaign contributions to incumbents and challengers in 2010, 2006 and 1994, and found that, with less than 100 days to the midterm election, Democrats have only 61 incumbent candidates who have raised less than 70 percent of the total campaign contribution haul in their respective races. This compares to 73 for both the majority Republicans in 2006 and the majority Democrats in 1994, the last two major wave elections. (See the infographic below to explore campaign funding percentages raised in individual races. Some races may be slightly out of order due to late night additions from Kansas, Michigan and Missouri.)<br><iframe src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/reporting/2010/campaign/2010-follow-the-money.html\" border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"500\" width=\"580\"></iframe><br>In 1994, of those in the majority party who exceeded the 70 percent threshold, only 3.3 percent of them lost. In 2006, those with over 70 percent lost even less frequently than in 1994\u2014just 0.8 percent.<br><br>There are nine races listed as toss-ups by the Cook Political Report where incumbents have raised over 70 percent of the total campaign contributions. Reps. Suzanne Kosmas (FL-24), Dina Titus (NV-03), Bill Foster (IL-14), Tom Perriello (VA-05), Joseph Cao (LA-02) and Mark Schauer (MI-07) all may have given themselves a fighting chance in their tough races. <br><br>So have the incumbent party candidates running in the open seats left vacant by the retiring Reps. Brian Baird (WA-03) and Paul Hodes (NH-02), the latter of who is running for the Senate.<br><br>Some other races also targeted by Republicans where incumbents have given themselves a good padding in campaign funding include Reps. Kathy Dahlkemper (PA-03), Jon Adler (NJ-03), Gabrielle Giffords (AZ-08) and Martin Heinrich (NM-01).<br><br>Perhaps most protected of those listed in toss-up races is freshman Rep. Alan Grayson (FL-08), who has raised 88 percent of the total campaign contributions in his race. In 1994 and 2006 combined only two congressmen lost reelection when raising a percentage of campaign contributions comparable to Grayson\u2019s. <br><br>Those two were both subject to unique circumstances. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, who was already imprisoned when he was on the ballot, and Rep. Dan Glickman, who\u2019s natural constituency had been moved out of his district in the post-1990 census redistricting.<br><br>On the other side of the coin are those who raise far less than their challenger. <br><br>Those who raise below 40 percent of the total campaign contributions in their race are almost guaranteed to lose. In 1994, incumbents and incumbent party candidates lost 91 percent of the time. In 2006, they lost 83 percent of the time. <br><br>There are currently eleven incumbents or incumbent party candidates who have raised less than 40 percent of the total campaign contributions in their races. Ten of these are Democrats and one is a Republican. <br><br>All but three of these races are open seats targeted by the opposition. Those other three races should have the Democratic majority worried though. They include three incumbents thought to be relatively safe, Reps. Tim Bishop (NY-01), Marcy Kaptur (OH-09) and Betty Sue Sutton (OH-13). <br><br>Both Kaptur and Sutton are raising less than 30 percent of the total contributions in their races, which in both 1994 and 2006 is a near slam-dunk loss. (In 2006, all incumbents lost when raising less than 30 percent. In 1994, one incumbent survived out of seven meaning that 86 percent lost.)<br><br>The open seat races that fall into this category include four rated as toss-ups by the Cook Political Report. These are the seats vacated by Reps. Bart Stupak (MI-01), Dennis Moore (KS-03), Joe Sestak (PA-07) and the seat left open by the resignation of Rep. Eric Massa (NY-29). <br><br>The worst race for the incumbent party is occurring in Tennessee where the Republican challenger to fill the open seat vacated by retiring Rep. Jim Cooper is raising 86 percent of the total campaign cash. The campaign contribution analysis backs up the Cook rating of this race as a Likely Republican takeover.<br><br>The only Republican-held seat in this batch of likely losers is the open seat to be vacated by Rep. Mike Castle (DE-AL), who is running for the Senate. The Republican running to hold Castle\u2019s seat is only pulling in 33 percent of the campaign contributions in his race. This looks like a likely pick-up for the majority Democrats.<br><br>With each 10 percent increase above the 40 percent mark comes a better chance at retaining your seat.<br><br>Those raising between 40 percent and 50 percent of the total campaign haul face significantly better odds than those under 40 percent in wave elections. Still, incumbents and incumbent party candidates in this range have a much harder time than those who raise more than their opponents.<br><br>In 1994, those who raised between 40 percent and 50 percent lost 50 percent of the time. In 2006, those raising in the same range lost 39 percent of the time.<br><br>There are currently nine Democrats and four Republicans who fall into this category. Six of the Democrats are members of Congress and all are either freshmen or sophomore congressmen. They include Reps. John Boccieri (OH-16), Jerry McNerney (CA-11), John Hall (NY-19), Mark Critz (PA-12), Harry Teague (NM-02) and Ron Klein (FL-22). Only Teague is listed as a toss-up in the Cook Political Report. Boccieri, McNerney, Hall and Critz are listed as Lean Democrat and Klein is listed as Likely Democrat.<br><br>Republican incumbent seats that could be in trouble include the seat of Rep. Dan Lungren and the open seat races in the seat of retiring Rep. Mark Kirk (IL-10), who is running for Senate, and the Alabama seat of Rep. Parker Griffith, who, after switching parties last December, was defeated in a Republican primary. Kirk\u2019s former seat is listed as a toss-up in the Cook Political Report.<br><br>The victory of Michael Pompeo, who raised less than other candidates, in the Republican primary for the district being vacated by Rep. Todd Tiahrt (KS-04) left the Republicans with another open seat where their candidate has raised less than 50 percent of the total campaign contributions. This seat is likely not to switch parties as the district is strongly Republican.<br><br>The ranges just above the 50 percent mark provide more comfort for the majority, as the rate of members who lose are lower, but this is where they could lose the largest number of seats.<br><br>In 1994, those who pulled in between 50-60 percent of the total campaign dollars lost 38.9 percent of the time. That led to 14 out of 36 incumbents or incumbent party candidates losing. In 2006, eight out 30 incumbents or incumbent party candidates lost, or 26.7 percent.<br><br>There are seventeen Democrats and eight Republicans who have raised between 50-60% of total campaign contributions in their races so far. The Cook Political Report lists seven of these as toss-ups, all but one held by Democrats. <br><br>Rep. Charles Djou (HI-01) holds the one Republican toss-up seat. Djou won the traditionally heavily Democratic seat in a special election race earlier this year when two Democrats divided the vote.<br><br>Seats that do not look promising for Democrats include those of Reps. Glenn Nye (VA-02), Mary Jo Kilroy (OH-15), Steve Driehaus (OH-01), Frank Kratovil (MD-01) and Travis Childers (MS-01). All are in difficult districts and are still not raising over 60 percent of the total campaign cash for their respective races. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter (NH-01) is barely cracking the 50 percent mark, but may survive as she has previously won election twice without ever getting much further over the 50 percent mark than she currently is.<br><br>In 1994, among those raising between 60 and 70 percent of the total campaign contribution dollars, one third lost. In 2006, one fifth of those in the same percentage range lost. There are currently 25 Democrats and 12 Republicans in the 60-70 percent range.<br><br>This includes four toss-up races, all held by Democrats. These are the seats of Reps. Michael Arcuri (NY-24), Betsy Markey (CO-04), Bobby Bright (AL-02) and Earl Pomeroy (ND-AL).<br><br>There is only one open seat race (AZ-03) in this percentage range and it is likely to be held by the incumbent Republican Party.<br><br>Whether the 2010 midterms will look like 2006 or 1994, or somewhere in between, more incumbents will likely lose in this bracket than just the four who are in difficult toss-up races.<br><br>(<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/follow-money-what-kind-wave-will-2010-bring-ashore/#comments\">See here for methodology</a>.)<br><br>", "date_published": "2010-08-04 12:55:02", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "follow-money-what-kind-wave-will-2010-bring-ashore", "tags": "Follow The Money, Campaign Finance, 2010 Midterms, Elections", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2178, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-08-04 11:19:55", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 10, "timestamp": "2010-08-03 14:16:28", "image": "", "title": "Citizens United: Tennessee's response", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;\"><i>The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/02/01/citizens-united-response-part-1-independent-expenditures/\">Citizens United v.

It's lacking one important tool, however: an accounting of state revenues. Online since 2005, the site boasts real-time updates, full downloadability and checkbook-level details. While it could benefit from a couple of improvements -- such as a list of the dates purchases were made -- it is a solid example of transparent accounting, at least on the payment side. According to Kelvin Simmons, Commissioner of Administration for the state, the website wasn't required by law when it went online, but subsequent legislation has institutionalized some of its offerings. <br><br><b>Timeliness:</b> According to Simmons, the website is entirely automated. Payments and <a href=\"http://mapyourtaxes.mo.gov/MAP/Employees/\">employee salaries</a> are updated in real time.<br><br><b>Downloadability:</b> All figures on the site, from entire fiscal years' worth of information to the results of individual searches, can be downloaded in machine-readable format by clicking on an \"Export\" button on the side of the page. The larger datasets can be obtained by heading over to the <a href=\"http://mapyourtaxes.mo.gov/MAP/Download/Default.aspx\">data download page</a>. <br><br><b>Expenditures:</b> The MAP site gets down in the weeds on<a href=\"http://mapyourtaxes.mo.gov/MAP/Expenditures/\"> this one</a>. You can learn that in Fiscal Year 2009, the Office of Administration's Housekeeping and Janitor Services paid a company called A1 Economy Fire Protection $46 for \"Fire Extinguisher Services.\" By searching by vendor name, you can see that in the last three fiscal years, that same company received $1,389 for various fire safety services.<br><br><b>Revenues:</b> State revenue data is not available on <a href=\"http://www.mapyourtaxes.mo.gov\">mapyourtaxes.mo.gov</a>. It's a big oversight, and one that if implemented, would bring Missouri's accountability site up to par with the best state sites in the nation.<br><br><b>Contracts:</b> Like expenditures, contracts are available at a granular level, and can be searched by vendor name or agency. The state also offers a search by contract number. Other information can be found on <a href=\"http://oa.mo.gov/purch/contracts/index.htm\">a separate site</a>, including details about winning and losing bids. This could come in handy both for reporters looking for improper dealings and for losing bidders looking for future contracts. Copies of the actual contracts aren't posted on the site, as they are in some other states.<br><br><b>Payroll Data:</b> <a href=\"http://mapyourtaxes.mo.gov/MAP/Employees/\">Current gross pay and year-to-date gross pay</a> are available.

After spending a portion of the funds on feasibility studies, engineers\r\nfound that the project would require a great deal of additional federal and\r\nstate money to complete. What\u2019s more, their studies showed the proposed improvements\r\nwould only increase highway speeds by an average of five miles per hour.<br><br>\r\nSo they halted the project. And nineteen years later, $10.6 million of\r\nthat original earmark remains unused. Since the money came from a federal highway\r\nearmark, it couldn\u2019t be shifted to another road or bridge unless Congress specifically redirected it. <br><br>Ronnie Baldwin, an engineer at ALDOT,\r\nsaid the agency currently has no plans to use the money. It wouldn\u2019t make sense\r\nfrom a cost benefit perspective, unless they could find a less expensive way to fulfill the earmark\u2019s\r\nmandate. \u201cThere may be something that comes up in the future\r\nthat won\u2019t cost as much to spend it on, but unfortunately that\u2019s not what the\r\nconstruction environment is like right now,\u201d Baldwin said, noting that\r\nconstruction costs have gone up in recent years.<br><br>\r\nThis is just one of the reasons why allocated federal dollars languish with local authorities--sometimes for decades. A total of $263 million from 150 earmarks remains unspent from the 1991\r\nbill that contained the Alabama earmark. In all, there were originally 538\r\nhighway earmarks in that act, known as the Intermodal Surface Transportation\r\nEfficiency Act (ISTEA). See <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/disappearmarks-billions-set-aside-earmarks-remain-unspent/\">here</a> for a downloadable database of earmarked funds for Federal Highway Administration projects over the\r\nlast two decades that have not yet been obligated \u2013 that is, the money hasn\u2019t\r\nyet been committed to be spent. <br><br>\r\nOver the last few weeks, the Sunlight Reporting Group has been <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/disappearmarks-millions-safetea-lu-transit-earmarks-are-unspent/\">tracking</a>\r\nthese kinds of transportation \u201cdisappearmarks,\u201d or funds set aside by Congress\r\nin federal transportation bills that haven\u2019t been fully spent. <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/disappearmarks-billions-set-aside-earmarks-remain-unspent/\">Two bills\r\ncurrently in Congress</a>, sponsored by Rep. Betsey Markey, D-Colo. and Sen.\r\nRuss Feingold, D-Wis., would rescind some of this unspent money. Sen.\r\nFeingold\u2019s bill would return the funds to federal coffers if at least 10\r\npercent hasn\u2019t been obligated after a decade.<br><br>While planners in state and federal departments of transportation often appreciate the cash, congressionally directed funds can alter their priorities. The inspector general for the Department of\r\nTransportation <a href=\"http://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/dot/files/pdfdocs/Congressial_Earmarks-_AV-2007-66----508_Compliant.pdf\">released a study</a> in 2007 that found that \"many earmarked projects considered by the\r\nagencies as low priority are being funded over higher priority, non-earmarked projects.\"<br><br>\r\nWhile Alabama officials were reluctant to criticize any type of federal aid in this tight economy, they did admit that directed funds like these can change the ground rules. \"Earmarked funds take away our ability to prioritize projects because they take away from other federal aid funds that would otherwise be available to us,\u201d said Lamar Woodham, an ALDOT representative. \u201cAny federal\r\nmoney that comes into the state we greatly appreciate; there's no doubt about\r\nthat. Figuring out how to maximize those dollars is the hard part.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nCASH-STRAPPED STATES<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn some cases, highway earmarks are eventually spent on much less ambitious versions of the projects originally specified. And simply completing these more modest goals can take decades.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAfter the local steel mill closed, officials in Beaver County, Pa., wanted to revitalize the struggling town of Aliquippa. Rep. Joseph Kolter, D-Penn., secured an earmark for $25 million to fund a new bridge that would drive traffic to an industrial center, but the designs that were favored by the public ran in excess of $100 million.\r\n<br><br>\r\nConstruction is finally scheduled to begin next summer -- twenty years after the original earmark was set aside \u2013 not on a new bridge, but on a rehabilitation of the old one.\r\n\r\nIt's not unusual for state departments of transportation to struggle to complete projects that were set in motion through Congressional earmarks. Cheryl Moon-Sirianni, a representative of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, said that in Aliquippa, money became very difficult to come by after the 1991 bill passed. Some local bridges were structurally deficient and the state couldn't afford to divert funds for their maintenance to complete the Aliquippa bridge. \"Beaver County only gets about $20 to $25 million from the Federal Highway Administration in a year, and that's for everything -- highway funds, bridge funds, and so on,\" Moon-Sirianni said. \"They couldn't sacrifice five to six years of projects for that one bridge.\u201d\r\n<br><br>\r\nHighway earmarks often simply provide seed money \u2013 enough to fund an environmental study that can help a project get up and running, for example, but not enough to fully fund the venture. Advocates of these set asides argue that without these infusions of cash up front, many\r\nneeded roads and bridges wouldn\u2019t have a chance of being built.\r\n<br>\r\nHighway officials argue that these earmarks can be delayed simply because major road projects are huge undertakings, and can take a long time to complete. As we <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/disappearmarks-billions-set-aside-earmarks-remain-unspent/\">mentioned in an earlier story</a>, the General Accounting Office <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d021067t.pdf\">estimated</a> that major road construction can take 9 to 19 years to complete.", "date_published": "2010-07-30 10:23:10", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "disappearmarks-how-highway-projects-get-left-behind", "tags": "disappearmarks, earmarks, Betsy Markey, Feingold, transportation, highways, FHWA, DOT", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2175, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-07-30 10:26:13", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 10, "timestamp": "2010-07-30 10:20:36", "image": "", "title": "FOIA protection expands", "excerpt": "", "content": "<div>A provision placed in the financial regulation reform bill, or the Frank-Dodd act recently signed by president Obama, is widening the gap between information held by the federal government and what is known by the general public.

Cloonan, the highest-ranking A.I.G. official who attended the fund-raising meeting with Mr. Rangel, wrote to the congressman asking him to support the extension of a tax provision designed to help American-based multinational companies lower their obligation to the I.R.S., which was set to expire. Mr. Rangel, who had announced plans to add an array of \u201ctax extenders\u201d to an energy bill he was preparing to introduce that month, opposed extending the specific measure Mr. Cloonan and A.I.G. were lobbying for.<br><br>The measure, known as the \u201csubpart F active financing exception,\u201d would benefit a broad coalition of American companies, including hundreds of financial services firms, and according to estimates by the nonpartisan Joint Taxation Committee would cost the Treasury $3.97 billion in revenue in 2009 and 2010. A.I.G., which Congressional records indicate spent more than $9.5 million on lobbying in 2008, had its own lobbyists and three outside firms pushing to extend the measure.<br><br>By early May 2008, concern about the damage that American businesses would suffer if the tax break was allowed to expire had grown so great that Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee held two meetings to ask Mr. Rangel to extend it.<br><br>Representative Joseph Crowley, a Democrat from Queens, said he pressed the issue because it helped Citigroup, a major employer in his district. At least two committee caucus meetings to discuss many aspects of the legislation followed \u2014 on May 7 and May 13 \u2014 and Mr. Rangel relented, Mr. Crowley said, and agreed to extend the measure for one year.</blockquote>The ethics committee did not specify which charges it would file against Rangel.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Rangel stepped down from the chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee on March 3, 2010.

The state's <a href=\"http://www.elections.state.ri.us/\">Board of Elections</a> has instead passed a new regulation that satisfies the Supreme Court ruling allowing corporations to influence races using their own money. <br><br>Like all states tasked with altering state laws in the wake of the Citizens United decision, Rhode Island is forcing certain elements of the transaction be disclosed to the public. Forms containing information regarding who paid for the expenditure and who directs control over payment of the expenditure (e.g. a corporation's CEO) must be filed with the Secretary of State's office. Funders of a company or a nonprofit may have to be disclosed if money was donated for the sole purpose of making independent expenditures.<br><br>The disclosure forms have to be filed electronically within seven days of the money being spent throughout the year, regardless of when an election is. This is important to note because some states have relaxed deadlines for reporting when money is spent outside of an election season. The Executive Director of the state's Board of Elections says all information should be available to the public within 24 hours of it being submitted.<br><br>Rhode Island's regulation also explicitly states that a reasonably visible and/or audible disclaimer must be included in print and electronic ads.

Data the Reporting Group acquired from the Federal Highways Administration shows that there are $6.5 billion worth of unspent earmarks from the most recent transportation funding bill, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, or SAFETEA-LU, passed in 2005.  <br><br><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">(Scroll down for a searchable and downloadable list of highway projects earmarked since 1991 that have spent ten percent or less of their total funding.

Bush signed the bill into law, thousands of the earmarked projects in the bill have used ten percent or less of the total funding allotted to them. <br><br>Officials claim that since some of these are massive highway projects, it takes longer to get them off the ground. There are many reasons why highway projects face long delays. Some have been <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/03/nyregion/03rail.html?_r=3&amp;scp=15&amp;sq=%22transportation+bill%22&amp;st=nyt\">politically difficult to complete</a>, either because the road or bridge isn't a priority for state officials or because communities are resistant to the project. Other ventures have suffered because states must struggle to come up with matching funds. In 2002, the Government Accountability Office <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d021067t.pdf\">estimated</a> that a major new federally financed construction highway project typically takes nine to 19 years to complete. <br><br>The Reporting Group obtained data on unspent earmarks from the Federal Highway Administration and from Markey's office, which released additional data for which the Reporting Group had an outstanding FOIA request.<br><br>Ranging from major new roads and bridges to small exploratory studies, these projects were funded through the major federal transportation bills that authorize new spending on highways, buses and other transportation needs every five years. The last three bills were known as ISTEA (1991), TEA-21 (1998) and SAFETEA-LU (2005).<br><br>Markey's bill would rescind unspent funding for earmarks after ten years; a measure similar to Markey's, sponsored by Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., passed the Senate earlier this year. <br><br>Earmarks are funds directed by Congress for particular projects. They are sometimes criticized for circumventing a more competitive allocation process, and because they place the legislator's priorities over those of the executive branch and state and local officials - for example, state highway planners.<br><br>In recent months, the Reporting Group has been looking at <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/disappearmarks-millions-safetea-lu-transit-earmarks-are-unspent/\">similar \"disappearmarks\"</a> for Federal Transit Administration projects, which were funded through the same transportation bills.

(Legally, contracts must be up no more than a month after the contract term begins).<br><br><b>Expenditures:</b> The expenditures that South Dakota discloses are at such a bird's-eye level that they're of little use to researchers who want to know what's really going on in state government. For example, you can see that the Administration Department of Public Safety spent $1,512 on supplies and materials in Fiscal Year 2010, but you can't tell what that money was spent on, how many purchases it represents or from whom, and you can't download any of the information to do your own analysis on it.<br><br><b>Revenues:</b> State revenues are about as granular as they are on the other state websites we've reviewed recently. You can see that the Tourism Department received $33,223 in operating grants from arts and history federal funds in Fiscal Year 2010, but it's a little confusing what they spent it on, especially since much more than that was distributed in grants in the same year.<br><br><b>Contracts:</b> The site displays PDFs of all contracts over $10,000. They're searchable by vendor name. It's a great feature if you want to investigate a particular company, but almost useless if you're trying to analyze state contracts in any systematic way. And the $10,000 limit is way too high, especially for such a small state.<br><br><b>Payroll data: </b>You have to know the employee's last name to find their salary (otherwise, you can only get a list of titles and pay rates, without names attached).

This would ensure that the data it plans \r\nto release this fall (which we wrote about <a href=\"../../../../2010/fda-launch-food-recall-database/\">here</a>)\r\n would be more complete.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The agency also <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/FDATransparencyTaskForce/TransparencyReport/DraftProposalbyTopicArea/ucm210552.htm\">proposes</a> to give the public access to reports of \"adverse events\"--instances when drugs or medical devices are causing harm--in a format that is \"searchable and and allows users to generate summary reports of this information.\"</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The agency&nbsp; says it <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/FDATransparencyTaskForce/TransparencyReport/DraftProposalbyTopicArea/ucm210566.htm\">would like</a> to notify the public when a company files a request to investigate a new drug or medical device, thereby starting clinical trials, and also to inform us when and if that application is withdrawn, placed on hold, or terminated. <br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">And it would like to issue \"relevant summary safety and effectiveness information\" for a product that has not gotten approval yet,\" if the Agency concludes that \"disclosure is in the interest of public health.\" This speaks partially to the problem at the core of our <a href=\"bit.ly/heartofmatter\">investigation</a>,\r\n \"Heart of the Matter: How Congress and Special Interests Kept Clinical \r\nTrial Data Secret,\" which explored how Congress, under heavy lobbying by the drug and medical device industries, created a loophole that \r\npermits data to be withheld from the public for drugs and medical \r\ndevices that don't make it to market.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, in leaving it to the agency to decide, behind closed doors, when \"disclosure is in the interest of public health,\" rather than letting all the information be free for reporters, experts, and everyone to see, this proposal is limited. As the journal Nature Medicine recently opined (subscription required):</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the end, new rules and regulations mean little if they are not implemented fully. The FDA, for instance, has yet to fully hew to its long-standing policy of releasing its analyses of drugs approved for new indications. Moreover, clinical trial sponsors are already required to register their trials with a US National Institutes of Health (NIH)<br>database, but a recent analysis showed that only about half do so in a<br>timely and complete way. <br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">And, as the Times notes, current required posting of clinical trials \"are often little more than cryptic references.\"</p><br>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Finally, in the case of Avandia, where crucial data\r\n reportedly were withheld, the agency cannot make available what it doesn't have any more than the U.S. Federal Election Commission can provide information about campaign contributions that a candidate does not report.<br></p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\"><br>Meanwhile, there's no guarantee that the FDA will implement all its transparency proposals.

The state was directly affected by the Citizens United ruling by making restrictions set up against independent expenditures unconstitutional. <br><br>The ruling has effectively reversed parts of the Michigan Campaign Finance act of 1976 prohibiting such expenditures. Now, corporations and labor unions that wish to make independent expenditures can. <br><br>If a company does create an electioneering communication, for example, it has to be registered as a Political Action Committee (PAC). The expenditure, like other types of political spending, has to be reported to the Michigan Secretary of State. It is unclear from the Secretary of State\u2019s Website whether or not the reporting has to be in real time. Reports reviewed for the purpose of this piece were biannual, meaning the corporations only have to report twice a year. That could prove problematic during election season and in the weeks immediately preceding votes because the level of influence via spending tends to increase and become more focused as races come to a close.

Chris Christie's executive order and was created in \r\nJanuary 2010. <br><br><b>Downloadable?: </b>Almost all of the site's data is downloadable as CSV (a machine-readable format) as well as in PDF format. This is a relatively \r\nrare feature that all transparency sites should offer.<br><br><b>Revenues:</b> The \r\ndata is less than a month old, and you can drill down to the funding level.\r\n For example, you can see that the Agriculture Department received $6,600 for\r\n organic certifications this month. What you can't see is which farms paid to be certified.<br><br><b>Expenditures:</b> One of the most important and currently \r\nweakest section, the expenditures data only gives you a starting point\r\n from which to investigate. For example, you can see that the \r\nAgriculture Department spent $2,000 on fuel and utilities in 2009, while\r\n it spent over $28,000 in these categories in 2007. But this is as \r\ngranular as it gets. And the data is a full year old.<br><br><b>Payroll \r\ndata: </b>CSV-downloadable; up-to-date.<br><br><b>Tax breaks: </b><a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/expenditure_report_final.pdf\">A\r\n PDF is available</a> of an annual tax expenditure report. Nothing \r\nmachine-readable. <br><br>UPGRADE IN OCTOBER:<br><br>State officials \r\npromise a major upgrade in October that will bring the expenditure data \r\ndown to the level of individual payments to individual vendors. This \r\nwould put New Jersey's site among the top transparency websites in the \r\ncountry. Officials also promise a raw data download of all spending \r\ninformation, as is currently <a href=\"http://nj.gov/transparency/revenue/\">available for revenues</a>. They say \r\nthe site will be updated on a quarterly basis, and will also include a \r\nsearchable database of pensions, real estate sales, and expenditures by \r\nauthorities (such as the Port Authorities).<br><br><b><u>CAMPAIGN FINANCE \r\nSITE:</u></b><br><a href=\"http://www.elec.state.nj.us\">www.elec.state.nj.us</a><br><br><b>Background:</b> The site has been around since 1998, and the earliest reports on the site date back to that era.<br><br><b>Downloadability:</b> \r\nThe raw data is available as CSV. <br><br><b>Granularity:</b> Excellent.

The provision was added by Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, a long-time supporter of the voluntary <a href=\"http://eiti.org/eiti\">Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative</a>, and by Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, also a Democrat. That global initiative is backed by the World Bank, United Nations, and other groups, and aims to combat government corruption in resource-rich countries by monitoring and verifying payments received from energy and mining companies.<br><br>The new U.S. requirement is good for investors, said Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cWhen oil, gas and mining companies do business overseas \u2013 whether in Angola, Kazakhstan, Burma, Venezuela, or any other country \u2013 they pay those governments for concessions, royalties and other fees,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe American people and investors need this transparency to know if they are investing in companies that are operating in dangerous or unstable parts of the world.\u201d<br><br>Human rights advocates hope the U.S. action will influence other countries. \u201cThis is going to be a tipping point because once the United States requires this, it\u2019s only a matter of time until other countries require corporate disclosure of this kind,\u201d said Isabel Munilla of <a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org/\">Publish What You Pay</a>, a coalition of human rights and environmental groups. The Hong Kong stock exchange recently adopted a similar requirement for companies traded on it, and there is a move underway by some British lawmakers to impose the requirement on the London stock exchange, she said.<br><br>The <a href=\"http://www.api.org/\">American Petroleum Institute</a>, which represents some 400 energy companies, opposes the new mandate.<br><br>Requiring only U.S. energy companies to report payments to host governments will hurt their ability to compete with quasi-governmental and national oil companies such as Russia\u2019s Gazprom and China National Petroleum Co, API chief executive Jack Gerard said in a May letter to lawmakers. \u201cDisclosing payments at this level of detail, including payments on a project level, means that foreign competitors would have access to very specific, propriety information that can be used against U.S.-listed companies in contract negotiations and for other purposes,\u201d the letter said. That could mean lost jobs, he said.<br><br>The API criticized what it called the bill\u2019s \u201cunilateral approach\u201d by the U.S. government.  Instead, the industry group said it prefers to see countries adopt the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative because it requires all companies operating in a specific country to report their payments and protects proprietary information, according to the letter. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that a U.S.-only approach is the best way,\u201d API spokeswoman Cathy Landry said.<br><br>In addition to detailing annual payments to foreign governments, U.S. energy and mining companies must also disclose how much they paid to various U.S. government agencies for production rights, according to the bill.<br><br>The financial reform bill, which focuses mostly on U.S. banking regulation and consumer financial protection, gives the SEC nine months to issue rules spelling out exactly how firms will report their energy and mining payment information. Companies must categorize the payments and include the currency used, the business unit that made the payments, the government that received the payments, and identify the project, the bill says. Reported payments must include taxes, royalties, license fees, production entitlements, bonuses, and other benefits that are part of the revenue stream from commercial development of oil, natural gas or minerals.<br><br>The SEC can demand any other information it finds \u201cnecessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors,\u201d the bill said. It set a nine-month deadline for the SEC to issue the regulations after the bill is signed into law. The House and Senate are expected to soon vote to approve the final language of the wide-ranging financial reform measure, sending it to the president for his signature.<br><br>\r\n<b>ABOUT THE DATA:</b>\r\n<b><br>What:</b>    Annual summary of U.S. energy, mining company payments to governments\r\n<br><b>Where:</b>  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\r\n<br><b>Availability:</b>   When SEC completes rulemaking, possibly in 2011\r\n<b><br>Format:</b>      Electronic data\r\n<br><b>Usability:</b>   TBD ", "date_published": "2010-07-02 12:03:20", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "us-energy-mining-companies-must-disclose-government-payments", "tags": "\"data mine\", \"financial reform bill\", \"extractive industries transparency initiative\", \"Securities and Exchange Commission\", \"Sen.

Charging for access works against public access,\u201d he said. <br><br>To make federal court documents available for free, Schultze co-founded RECAP, a Firefox plug-in that PACER users can use to automatically donate the court documents they purchase from PACER into a public repository. RECAP will also alert users when a document they are searching for within PACER is already available in the repository.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s true that the cost of running PACER has grown only slowly over time, but the profits have grown dramatically,\u201d Schultze said last week at a Center for American Progress meeting to discuss Law.gov, a series of workshops discussing the potential for a registry and repository of all primary legal materials in the United States. Law.Gov would be similar to Data.Gov, providing bulk data and feeds to commercial, non-commercial, and governmental organizations wishing to build web sites, operate legal information services, or otherwise use the raw materials of our democracy. <br><br>PACER collected about $90 million in revenue in 2009, accompanied by what the federal judiciary calls a \u201ccarryforward\u201d \u2013 revenue left after costs were paid \u2013 of $40 million, according to Schultze.&nbsp; His analysis found PACER fees have funded projects unrelated to electronic document access such as upgrading federal courtrooms with flat-screen monitors and enhanced audio systems.<br><br>\u201cFee revenue in some years has exceeded expenditures, but that money does not comprise a \u2018surplus,\u2019\u201d said Richard Carelli, a spokesman for the Administrative Office of the Courts, the office responsible for the PACER system. \u201cRather, that money has been something of a war chest for future projects.\u201d<br><br>Those future projects include updating the case file/electronic case management system through which each district federal court files all of its records and creating a \u201cnext generation PACER\u201d which aims to be more searchable and user-friendly, according to Carelli. <br><br>PACER also competes with Westlaw and LexisNexis, which offer more sophisticated searching and display capabilities and charge higher fees for access.<br><br>The PACER system has already undergone some recent improvements. In addition to an enhanced search mechanism, this year it also began offering online digital recordings of court proceedings for $2.40 per file, compared to the previous fee of&nbsp; $26 for a CD copy from a court clerk\u2019s office.<br><br>\u201cWe anticipate that the percentage of PACER users who do not pay a penny will climb to 75 percent in FY2010,\u201d Carelli said.&nbsp; In March, the Judicial Conference decided to amend the fee schedule so that fees are waived for users who accrue less than $10 in costs per quarter. Previously, annual charges of $10 or less were waived. <br><br>\u201cWe believe we are good stewards of the fee revenue,\u201d Carelli said, \u201cand we are subject to Congressional oversight and annual audits.

On May 26, the North Carolina Assembly introduced an act that would amend its election laws in response to Citizens United. If the state does pass the proposed act, it will officially repeal the laws made unconstitutional by the momentous ruling. <br><br>According to state election officials, the bill is on the legislative calender for discussion this week. While the bill might change, HB 2023 looks a lot like <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/citizens-united-iowas-response/\">the bill Iowa passed</a>. <br><br>North Carolina wants corporations to obtain approval from their executive board before going forward with expenditures. The act proposed will require any corporation that makes an independent expenditure to file a report within 48 hours of doing so. The disclosure will contain information about who paid for the ad and who it intended to support or oppose. All of this information is supposed to be made available to the public. <br><br>The bill being worked on also requires that anyone or any organization that donates money solely for the purpose of creating ads to corporations be disclosed.

Quite well, say open government boosters like US Public Interest Research Group, who recently ranked the state third in their review of state websites designed to get crucial spending data online. Still, local transparency advocates can teach state officials a thing or two about making a site useful to reporters.<br>The state site, <a href=\"http://www.accountability.illinois.gov\">accountability.illinois.gov</a>, features a database of expenditures and one of employee salaries. It's updated nightly, and is searchable by vendor name and contract number.<br>What it doesn't have is downloading capability. This is a huge oversight that makes it very difficult for reporters to analyze the data. A third party site,<a href=\"http://illinoisopengov.org/\"> illinoisopengov.org</a>, run by the free market-oriented <a href=\"http://www.illinoispolicy.org/\">Illinois Policy Institute</a>, has requested the same data through Freedom of Information Act requests and, since December 2009, has been allowing csv or Excel downloads.<br>What's more, <a href=\"http://illinoisopengov.org/\">illinoisopengov.org</a> allows you to drill down to the smallest expenditures; for example, you can find out that the Department of Employment Security spent $509 on Xerox High Speed Labels in 2009. And it's more searchable and sortable -- you can search within a dollar range, or by a description of the purchase. It's also easier to search through contracts and pensions, which are buried within the bowels of <a href=\"http://accountability.illinois.gov/\">accountability.illinois.gov</a> <a href=\"http://accountability.illinois.gov/Expenditures/Category/CategoryDetails.aspx?Year=2010&amp;Agency=0&amp;Vendor=0&amp;Contract=*&amp;Category=1200\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://accountability.illinois.gov/Expenditures/Agency/Categories.aspx?Year=2010&amp;Agency=589\">here</a>. (Technically, contracts have their own section, but are only searchable there by contract number, which is useless to the average citizen).<br>The problem with <a href=\"http://illinoisopengov.org/\">illinoisopengov.org</a> is that, because staff must rely on the FOIA process, the data is only updated about once a year. Now if the state site would simply incorporate some of <a href=\"http://illinoisopengov.org/\">illinoisopengov.org</a>'s features, we'd have the best of both worlds.

However, this legislation has been in the works since 2009 and was not in response to the Citizens United decision. <br><br>Lori Anderson, a spokesperson for Washington's Public Disclosure Commission, said that the increase in disclosure requirements is merely a coincidence. <br><br>Washington doesn't have any restrictions on corporate spending in elections and has always mandated disclosure for money spent to influence elections. Incidentally\u2014and very much worth noting\u2014 <a href=\"http://www.pdc.wa.gov/QuerySystem/candidates.aspx\">Washington has an excellent searchable database</a> containing detailed information on who spent money and the purpose of the expenditure.&nbsp; <br><br>California, a state that was responding to the Supreme Court ruling, has introduced both an Assembly bill and a <a href=\"http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/asm/ab_0001-0050/ajr_3_bill_20100301_amended_sen_v95.html\">House Resolution</a>. The Resolution expresses California's unhappiness with the ruling. The assembly bill will force corporations to gain shareholder approval before making any independent expenditures. The bill will also require annual disclosure to the Secretary of State's Website. <br><br>New York is also increasing attention towards independent expenditures by corporations. New York, like California, is requiring corporations to have shareholder approval before going forward with independent expenditures. The organizations also have to file an annual disclosure with shareholders and the Secretary of State, which contain the business rationale for making expenditures. This is among states' usual disclosure requirements, such as how much was spent and who the money was intended to support or oppose.<br><br>", "date_published": "2010-06-29 13:45:39", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "citizens-united-new-york-california-and-washington", "tags": "Campaign Finance, Independent expenditure, Citizens United, New york, California, Washington, Disclose act, mccain feingold, independent expenditure", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2148, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-06-30 18:26:05", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2010-06-28 18:16:59", "image": "", "title": "Lowered expectations of high value data", "excerpt": "", "content": "Derek Willis, a colleague of mine from our days at the Center for Public Integrity, has an interesting <a href=\"http://blog.thescoop.org/archives/2010/06/27/big-numbers-low-impact/\">post</a> on the state of Open Government Data in the summer of 2010, titled \"Big Numbers, Low Impact.\" It's well worth reading--and raises several interesting points, not least of which is that for governments--federal, state and local--that are looking for advice, \"the transparency movement isn\u2019t exactly providing a lot of clarity, or even the right kind of input.\"<br><br>I tend to agree, particularly when it comes to the question of what the Obama administration called accountability data in its open government directive. Willis links to <a href=\"http://goodspeedupdate.com/2010/2976\">this post</a> from Rob Goodspeed, which defines it this way:<br><blockquote><b>3. Data to Help Hold Government Accountable</b>\r\nA host of budget, voting, and performance data should be released to hold government accountable. However, metrics produced internally as part of stat-type programs introduces the problem of mixed motives. Why would governments want to release the data that can be used against them? This problem can be partially avoided by separating the data from the operations within the government organization. This concern also introduces the important issue of presenting information in accurate ways, and including metadata about definitions and collection methodology.<br></blockquote><br>Goodspeed's trio--budget, voting and performance data--at least starts us down the road of what we're talking about when we talk about accountability data, but still is not quite satisfactory. We already have pretty good <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/roll_call/all\">voting data</a> for Congress as a whole (though having better transparency for <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/10/08/boehner-asks-for-more-committee-transparency/\">congressional committee votes </a>isn't quite there yet).

Though I like the dual nature of John's approach to this problem:<br><br><blockquote>Sunlight is particularly interested in what we\u2019re thinking of as accountability data.  Accountability data is information about an agency and its functions, or about those entities that report to the agency, that allows those entities or the agency to be held accountable.  While that\u2019s a somewhat tautological definition, the distinction is important.  Some information has enormous transformative potential, and empowers oversight and accountability.  This information also can be the most embarrassing, or the hardest to relinquish control over.  That\u2019s where we want to see agencies\u2019 attention \u2014 on fixing tough problems.<br><br>Up to now there has been a bit of a priorities vacuum, where publicizing information on the Internet has happened in an ad-hoc manner, in response to laws (albeit unreliably) or often because it serves an agency\u2019s or department\u2019s self-interest.  As we move beyond a request-based FOIA world of data access, and achieve more affirmative publication, we\u2019re going to need new distinctions about what can be public, and new priorities for where to focus our energy.  Accountability data is our first priority, and should be agencies first priority as well.</blockquote><br><br>\r\n", "date_published": "2010-06-28 18:10:11", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "lowered-expectations-high-value-data", "tags": "", "is_published": false}}, {"pk": 2147, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-06-25 21:36:28", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 11, "timestamp": "2010-06-25 14:40:10", "image": "", "title": "Sunlight Labs weighs in on Earmark bill ", "excerpt": "", "content": "In yesterday\u2019s <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/levin-and-coburn-toe-toe-earmark-transparency-bill/\">Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs meeting</a>, Sen.

[. . .] such a bill would prevent abortions in cases of fetal deformity. As we've discussed, I think it would be hard to argue that such a position is unconstitutional,[. . .].\"<br><br>Kagan goes on to explain what needs to be discussed regarding the matter and how it would or would not satisfy the precedent set by Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992). The Casey ruling says that a fetus' viability is a critical marker for government regulations on abortions, but up until that point no undue burden, or substantial obstacle, shall be placed in the way of access to an abortion: <br><br>\"What happens if the health exception is included, but the bill continues to apply to pre-viability as well as post-viability abortions? As a legal matter, the question here has to do with whether this an undue burden. A certain answer to this question would require lots of facts we don't know, having to do with the circumstances in which this procedure could (or could not) be replaced by other procedures; my hunch, though, is that the undue burden argument would be a stretch.\"<br><br>If appointed, Kagan will likely have to rule on these issues rather soon. <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/inquirer/world_us/20100530_New_Nebraska_abortion_law_is_designed_to_be_a_test_case.html\">Nebraska recently passed a law</a> banning abortion after 20 weeks based on the idea that fetuses that young can feel pain and makes no exception for mental health.

The 5-4 ruling in favor of Citizens United reversed a provision of the McCain-Feingold act that prohibited any electioneering communication\u2014defined as advertising via broadcast, cable or satellite that is paid for by corporations or labor unions. Many states have acted fast to counter corporations\u2019 ability to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections by passing laws that force disclosure of all independent expenditures in near real time. The Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group has decided to report what each of these states is doing to respond to the highly-contested ruling.

In a House Resolution, Kentucky has expressed its disappointment over the Supreme Court\u2019s decision Citizens United v. FEC case. <br>The resolution quotes President Obama by stating, \"the Court's opinion gives 'a green light to a new stampede of special interest money in our politics' and represents a victory for the 'powerful interests that marshal their power every day in Washington to drown out the voices of everyday Americans.'\"<br>The opinion serves as a way for the state to force disclosure requirements on any corporation that wants to spend its own money independent of a candidate to influence an election. Now, organizations have to register with the state and file a disclosure containing details about the expenditure. Kentucky hasn\u2019t yet repealed the law that was made unconstitutional by the Citizens United decision, but has instead addressed it with the opinion and the resolution. The state did this ahead of the issue being taken up by its legislature. <br>According to the opinion, the disclosure statement ideally should contain the amount spent to influence the election and which candidate the ad intended to support or oppose. If the corporation receives donations from outside sources, then it has to register as a committee as well. <br>Emily Dennis, General Counsel for the Kentucky Secretary of State, says forcing corporations to register as committees is supposed to prevent individuals from using them as conduit and hiding behind those corporations without being revealed. <br>The disclosure forms have to be filed when the money is spent, with the exception of the committees. They file every 30 days and once again 15 days before an election. This leaves the details of ads paid for within two weeks of an election in the dark until a month after the election is done. Also, Kentucky doesn\u2019t have an electronic system set up yet that would make the forms available online to the public.

The site has two main functions: first, it displays the state treasury's <a href=\"http://www.azcheckbook.com/mob/\">operating balance</a>, updated daily. The accompanying graph neatly depicts the state finances' steep plunge into the red over the last three years. <br><br>The site also reports aggregate <a href=\"http://www.azcheckbook.com/comptroller-object/\">revenue and expenditure data</a>. For example, you can see that the largest portion of <a href=\"http://www.azcheckbook.com/comptroller-object/view-object/id/6042/\">state sick leave money</a> was spent by the Department of Corrections, with the Department of Transportation coming in second. But you can't see how much of that sick leave money was spent on cops or bus drivers or administrative employees. You can also see the total amounts that each agency spent within various budget categories each year. (For example, the Department of Environmental Quality has <a href=\"http://www.azcheckbook.com/agency/view/code/EVA\">received almost 20 percent</a> of its 2010 budget from licensing and permits, and<a href=\"http://www.azcheckbook.com/agency/view/code/EVA/type/expenditures/\"> spent about $126,000</a> on capital equipment). But you can't get the details of the individual payments or who they went to. The numbers aren't real time - they're updated monthly -- and nothing on the site is downloadable or machine-readable.<br><br>Martin, who's currently running against incumbent Jan Brewer in the Republican gubernatorial primary, blames the lack of more granular data on the governor's office, which houses the state's accounting system. \"We put up every piece of information we have,\" he said.

The act was in place from August 2005 to September 2009 and was renewed temporarily by Congress earlier this year. In March, President Obama signed the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, which extended the SAFETEA-LU until the end of 2010.<br><br>The $119.2 million in unspent transit funds are from over 150 earmarks Congress approved in 2006 and 2007 that had been set aside under SAFETEA-LU for communities to purchase new buses, plan and build light rail and bus rapid transit projects, and fund state and local evaluations of transit projects.<br><br>The top ten unspent earmarks include:<br><ol><li>$19.6 million for a proposed New Starts light rail system by the Triangle Transit Authority in North Carolina that which expired in 2008.</li><li>Nearly $10 million to assist in constructing Renaissance Square in Rochester, N.Y., that would have included a performing arts center, a college satellite campus and a bus terminal.

It is the first time that allocations for these discretionary funds from lapsed SAFETEA-LU earmarks will take place. The funds for those unrealized projects will be combined with other unallocated funds and awarded to <a href=\"http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-29374.pdf\">urban circulator systems</a>, bus <a href=\"http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-29242.pdf\">livability initiative improvement grants</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-05-04/pdf/2010-10430.pdf\">bus and bus facilities</a>, and other <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-05-28/pdf/2010-12950.pdf\">discretionary livability programs</a>. The total amount of unallocated resources, which includes lapsed earmarks, that will be distributed is over $1 billion.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<p></p><b>Why earmarks become disappearmarks</b><br><br>The reasons for unspent earmark funds differ from community to community. In many cases, internal factors at the project level led to the funds lapsing. In Rochester, N.Y., for example, the community was given nearly $10 million in transit earmarks to assist in building Renaissance Square, a project that was touted as the largest public works project in the county\u2019s history, combining a performing arts center, a satellite college campus and bus terminal. But a <a href=\"http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=20106020326\">conflict between city and county officials</a> killed the plan, and the project is now defunct.<br><br>In Tennessee, the Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority was unable to spend nearly $1.4 million in earmarks that would have funded an intermodal transportation facility at the airport. That project was nixed, when the Authority decided to get rid of a bus component to the project \u2013 making them ineligible for a transit earmark, said Authority spokesman John Greaud.<br><br>\u201cThere was a change in philosophy on the mode of operation and the needs of the airport and we needed to focus on public parking and rental cars\u2026 it was no longer intermodal,\u201d Greaud said. <br><br>Many of these lapsed earmarks were also for New Starts projects \u2013 which include light rail, commuter rail, rapid rail and bus rapid transit projects \u2013 that failed to be funded after 2006 when the Bush administration instituted stricter rules for getting federal funding for New Starts projects. For more on this, read this <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/earmark-disappearmark-policy-shift/\">previous Disappearmark story</a>.<br><br>Other earmarked projects simply ran out of time to be funded. In Syracuse, N.Y., the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority was awaiting environmental approvals to build a downtown transit hub for their bus system when their earmark lapsed.<br><br>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t put those funds towards construction without design and engineering being at least 30 percent in progress. And we couldn\u2019t get that until we had a site. And we couldn\u2019t get a site until we had complete local approval,\u201d said Steve Share, a senior vice president of the Syracuse authority. \u201cThese [earmarks] have a three year life and we were unable to get through the process of getting all the local approvals.\u201d<br><b><br>Another way to spend lapsed funds</b><br><br>These lapsed earmarks only represent what is currently listed in FTA books as unspent or partially spent. Thus, it\u2019s not a complete picture of all the SAFETEA-LU earmarks that have failed to be funded within the earmarks\u2019 deadlines. <br><br>That\u2019s because Congress can also extend or reprogram individual earmarks in annual appropriation acts, which are not part of the FTA list of lapsed earmarks. In the Fiscal Year <a href=\"http://www.fta.dot.gov/funding/apportionments/grants_financing_9562.html\">2009</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fta.dot.gov/funding/apportionments/grants_financing_11165.html\">2010</a> appropriation acts, nearly $23 million in lapsed new starts and bus and bus-related earmarks were reprogrammed using this method.<br><br>Congressional chairs can also write letters to the Transportation Secretary that direct the FTA to reallocate, extend, or reprogram specific earmarks, with the Secretary\u2019s approval. The FTA does not track this method however, as it takes place outside of the annual appropriation act. To learn about an example of this Congressional reallocation option, read this <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/disappearmarks-buffalos-switcheroo/\">prior Disappearmark story</a> about a reallocated project in Buffalo. <br><br>The Buffalo project was reprogrammed as a result of a letter from Rep. John Olver and Sen. Patty Murray on January 16, 2009. <br><br>In the meantime, the FTA is currently working to spend these lapsed funds on projects chosen through a competitive process. That\u2019s a better method than earmarking, some watchdog groups say.<br><br>\u201cThat\u2019s the way all this money should have been spent in the first place,\u201d said Tom Schatz, President of Citizens Against Government Waste, which tracks earmarks. <br><br>Steve Ellis, the vice president of the budget watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense agrees.<br><br>\u201cIt would have been good if it had started that way in 2005,\u201d Ellis said of the upcoming FTA distribution of the unspent earmark money. \u201cA lawmaker gets to brag about what he got or obtained, but in reality it\u2019s been a mirage for the community. I freely concede that lawmakers know and understand their district, but they\u2019re not transit experts anymore than they are defense experts or police experts. They shouldn\u2019t be figuring where or how we should be spending our money. In many ways it ends up being a lot of wasted time rather than an efficient process to allocate precious tax dollars.\u201d<br><br>(Full Disclosure: The Sunlight Foundation has funded Taxpayers for Common Sense.)<br><p></p></div>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe title=\"Lapsed FTA SAFETEA-LU Earmarks\" src=\"http://data.sunlightlabs.com/w/ph2d-v5r8/y34g-bnf3?cur=3amTltXCb58\" width=\"500px\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"425px\" scrolling=\"no\">&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=\"http://data.sunlightlabs.com/Government/Lapsed-FTA-SAFETEA-LU-Earmarks/ph2d-v5r8\" title=\"Lapsed FTA SAFETEA-LU Earmarks\" target=\"_blank\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Lapsed FTA SAFETEA-LU Earmarks&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;</iframe><p><a href=\"http://www.socrata.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Powered by Socrata</a></p></div>", "date_published": "2010-06-22 08:58:45", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "disappearmarks-millions-safetea-lu-transit-earmarks-are-unspent", "tags": "disappearmark, disappearmarks, earmark, earmarks, FTA, Federal Transit Administration, Transportation, FOIA, Freedom of Information Request", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2106, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-06-21 14:31:53", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 12, "timestamp": "2010-05-26 17:32:58", "image": "", "title": "OGD: Medicare data shows trouble spots for nursing homes", "excerpt": "", "content": "A couple of weeks ago we looked at <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/medicare-data-reveals-nursing-home-abuse-and-neglect/\">one Florida nursing home</a>&nbsp; to see what available government data could tell us about the quality of care. Today we'll take a look at what the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) data can tell us about nursing homes throughout the nation as a whole. <br><br>A few well-respected researchers (such as <a href=\"http://nccnhr.org/sites/default/files/OSCAR%20complete%202009.pdf\">Charlene Harrington and her colleagues</a> at the University of California, San Francisco) have tackled these questions in depth, but reporters can still glean useful nuggets through their own quick and dirty analysis.<br><br>We used the Nursing Home Compare data at <a href=\"http://data.medicare.gov\">data.medicare.gov</a> to look at the average number of \"deficiencies,\" as surveyors refer to violations of federal health and safety standards, per home. In 2009, the average number of violations varied widely, from a mere 4.6 per home in Rhode Island to 23.8 per home in the District of Columbia (which, unfortunately, was too small to appear on our map).<br><br><b>AVERAGE NUMBER OF DEFICIENCIES PER HOME - 2009</b><br><i>(Note: Dark colors indicate MORE deficiencies.)</i><br><script src=\"http://www.gmodules.com/ig/ifr?url=http://www.google.com/ig/modules/geomap.xml&amp;up__table_query_url=http://tables.googlelabs.com/gvizdata?tq=select+gvizregion%28col0%29%252Ccol1%252Ccol0+from+198524++skip+0+limit+53&amp;up__table_query_refresh_interval=0&amp;up_region=US&amp;up_dataMode=regions&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;border=%23ffffff%7C3px%2C1px+solid+%23999999&amp;synd=open&amp;output=js\"></script><br><br>We also looked at staffing levels, a key indicator of the quality of care that nursing home residents receive. CMS awards each home between one and five stars based on how many registered nurses (RNs) are available to patients. (RNs are the most highly-trained and can administer medication).<br><br>Some states have, on average, much better-staffed homes than others. Louisiana's nursing facilities, for example, received an average of only 1.6 stars based on the number of RNs per patient; each of Alaska's homes got five. The following ratings were assessed at each home's most recent survey, within the last year and a half.<br><br><b>AVERAGE RN STAFFING RATING</b><br><i>(Note: Dark colors indicate HIGHER ratings.)</i><br><br><script src=\"http://www.gmodules.com/ig/ifr?url=http://www.google.com/ig/modules/geomap.xml&amp;up__table_query_url=http://tables.googlelabs.com/gvizdata?tq=select+gvizregion%28col0%29%252Ccol1%252Ccol0+from+194707++skip+0+limit+51&amp;up__table_query_refresh_interval=0&amp;up_region=US&amp;up_dataMode=regions&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;border=%23ffffff%7C3px%2C1px+solid+%23999999&amp;synd=open&amp;output=js\"></script><br><i>(Note: The District of Columbia doesn't appear on the map, but its average rating for RN staffing was 3.1.)</i><br><br>There are a couple of important caveats to consider when viewing this data. When comparing states' performances, keep in mind that the surveying agencies at some states are better staffed than others, have better training budgets, and may be better equipped to investigate and find problems. This can affect the comparative performance of homes in different states.<br><br>Staffing data should also be taken with a grain of salt because the ratings are based on data that is currently self-reported. This is due to change within the next couple of years as health care reform goes into effect.<br><br>Other factors that can affect the number of registered nurses in a facility include the size of the nursing homes in a state (smaller homes tend to have better ratios) and whether a majority of the homes are part of a hospital rather than stand-alone facilities. Alaska's homes, for instance, have very good ratings on staffing. This might be because the state's 15 homes have the fewest residents on average (41.6), and may also be because 11 of the 15 are located within hospitals.<br>", "date_published": "2010-06-21 14:31:51", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "medicare-data-shows-trouble-spots-nursing-homes", "tags": "medicare, OGD, CMS Open government directive", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2135, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-06-23 11:35:00", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 10, "timestamp": "2010-06-17 17:22:33", "image": "", "title": "Citizens United: Alaska's response", "excerpt": "", "content": "<i>The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/02/01/citizens-united-response-part-1-independent-expenditures/\">Citizens United v.

There is no question that BP is liable for the damages.

It features a <a href=\"http://opendoor.ky.gov/search/Pages/default.aspx\">searchable database of expenditures, contracts and salaries</a>. Users can see, for example, that the Department of Corrections spent $1.9 million on overtime payments in 2009 (as compared to nearly $130 million on salaries), or that the Highways Department spent $105 million on highway repairs. Users can also look up an individual vendor to find out how much it received.<br />\r\n\tThe site&#39;s biggest strength is its timeliness. Expenditure and contract information is updated on a daily basis. According to Greg Haskamp, a member of the state&#39;s e-Transparency Task Force, the online information is as timely and accurate as the state accounting system itself. Salary information is updated automatically twice a month, as it&#39;s updated in the personnel files.<br />\r\n\tFor reporters wanting to analyze the data, however, OpenDoor.ky.gov has significant limitations. The data is currently not downloadable, and columns aren&#39;t sortable. So if a vendor has received 15 pages worth of contracts, its very difficult, for example, to determine what the highest individual payment was, or to extract contracts for a particular date range.<br />\r\n\tHaskamp says public requests drive the site&#39;s offerings, so if Kentuckians complain about these missing functions, there&#39;s a better shot they&#39;ll be included. In the meantime, it would be nice to see the state expand from housing just spending data on OpenDoor to including other types of records in that central location. Currently much of the data that would be interesting to reporters is scattered across various sites; for example, decisions by the state&#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission are posted on <a href=\"http://www.koshrc.ky.gov/2000_present.htm\">that agency&#39;s site</a> (in unsearchable, unsortable PDF format). The Kentucky Labor Cabinet has <a href=\"http://www.labor.ky.gov/workersclaims/researchstats/\">statistics about worker injury claims</a>, but again, they&#39;re not machine readable, and they&#39;re located on the <a href=\"http://www.labor.ky.gov/workersclaims/researchstats/\">Labor Cabinet&#39;s site</a>.<br />\r\n\tRecovery Act information is available online, too, at <a href=\"http://kentuckyatwork.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx\">KentuckyAtWork.ky.gov</a>. That site hosts a searchable feature, similar to OpenDoor&#39;s, that shows how much federal money went to contractors in the state. It&#39;s the same information that&#39;s up on recovery.gov, and it&#39;s available on a quarterly basis.

Both put into law a series of disclosure requirements that force corporations to submit a form stating which candidate they are supporting or opposing and how much money was spent on the advertisement. Neither state went as far as prohibiting foreign companies from making independent expenditures or forcing nonprofits to disclose their funders, as some states did. <br>The statements will be filed electronically within 48 hours of the expenditure being made. The document will be available to the public within 24 hours of the West Virginia Secretary of State receiving it and posted to the state\u2019s website.

This week we're starting with Iowa:<br></i><br>State: Iowa<br><br>Bill: <a href=\"http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/Cool-ICE/default.asp?Category=billinfo&amp;Service=Billbook&amp;menu=false&amp;ga=83&amp;hbill=SF2354\">SB 2354</a><br><br>Passed: Yes<br><br>Website: <a href=\"http://www.state.ia.us/government/iecdb/viewreports/\">http://www.state.ia.us/government/iecdb/viewreports/</a> <i><br><br></i>Iowa is going beyond other states in its response to the Citizens United case by requiring an organization\u2019s executive board or leadership to provide a written approval notice for any independent expenditure made on the group's behalf. <br>Also, like other states that have had to repeal laws prohibiting independent expenditures, the state is requiring electronic disclosure that will be available to the public in near-real time. Organizations paying for ads must disclose details about the expenditure within 48 hours of the ad going out to the public, or the money being spent, whichever is sooner. Iowa is currently redesigning parts of its <a href=\"http://www.state.ia.us/government/iecdb/\">Ethics &amp; Campaign Disclosure Board</a> website to accommodate the new provision. Previously, disclosure notices were submitted handwritten and had to be scanned in. <br>Like <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/citizens-united-minnesotas-response/\">Minnesota</a>, Iowa is requiring nonprofits to disclose funders--but this provision is restricted to contributions received specifically to be used for independent expenditures. Charlie Smithson, Executive Director of Iowa\u2019s campaign disclosure board, admits that enforcement of this provision will be tricky.<br>Another provision unique to Iowa, although similar to the DISCLOSE Act in Congress now, is a prohibition against organizations that are owned by or are subsidiaries of foreign corporations from making independent expenditures.&nbsp; <br>Smithson says that the new requirements coming from this law are \u201cenhancing transparency in the state\u2019s elections,\u201d and \u201cprovide much more detail than in the past.\u201d<br>The law is currently active, but the disclosure information won\u2019t be available to the public until the website is complete.

And in an effort to force disclosure and enhance transparency, the state is forcing any corporation that wishes to make independent expenditures to create a committee and register. All independent expenditures have to be funneled through these committees or they can\u2019t be made. <br>The purpose of this new type of committee is to give the state a clear cut place to collect information about money used to influence elections. Jeff Sigurdson,&nbsp; the Assistant Executive Director at the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board, calls them a \u201creporting mechanism,\u201d that the state didn\u2019t have before. <br>In addition to knowing who an ad was paid for by and how much was spent, Minnesota is also requiring organizations that receive funding from donors \u2013 such as nonprofits -- to disclose who those funders are if they want to make independent expenditures. Disclosing funders goes a step further than some states, where only the name of the organization and the amount is required to be disclosed.&nbsp; <br>All disclosures can be found online, but not in real time. Minnesota has a schedule setup for reporting and no immediate disclosure provision was included in the new law. <br><br><i><br></i>", "date_published": "2010-06-10 15:03:54", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "citizens-united-minnesotas-response", "tags": "Independent Expenditure, Campaign Finance, Citizens United,minnesota, Disclose act, mccain feingold", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2123, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-06-09 17:47:53", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 3, "timestamp": "2010-06-08 11:52:46", "image": "", "title": "In six months, House offices spent $673 million on salaries, equipment, expenses", "excerpt": "", "content": "In the final month of fiscal year 2009, House committees and offices went on a shopping spree, spending more than $60 million left in their budgets before it disappeared.

The company was paid close to $8 million between June and December 2009. And among the top ten companies that do business with the House, three are companies that supply technology, followed by phone companies such as AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless.<br><br>IConstituent LLC, a company that caters only to elected officials, is among the top 15 on this list and has been paid more than $1.7 million in the six-month period. Established in 2001, they provide e-communication services for hundreds of officials across the country and include services such as e-mailing constituents and helping members of Congress build their outreach to constituents.<br><br>The top three lawmakers' offices that spent the most include Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif, ($893,000) Rep. Daniel Lipinski D- Ill., ($870,820) and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., ($858,000).<br><br>During the same six-month period, Congress spent more than $14 million on travel. The travel expenditures include airfare back to members' home districts on a frequent basis as well as reimbursements for car rentals and meals. Not surprisingly, the top three members of Congress who have spent the most on travel--Don Young, R-Alaska., Madeleine Bordallo, D-Guam and Rep. Harry Teague, D-N.M.\u2014have home districts quite a distance from Washington D.C. <br><br>The disbursement data also shows what congressional committees and offices spend. The Office of Emergency Planning, Preparedness and Operation, set up after the September 11 attacks to manage emergency operations for Congress in the event of a crisis, spent the most on travel--more than $121,000 in the last half of 2009. The House Information Services was second, spending $114,000 on travel followed by the Committee on Judiciary ($73,000). <br><br>Another major chunk of the money was spent on what is described as \"habitation expenses\" that can range from buying flowers to furniture; House offices spent almost $640,000 on congressional decor, buying decorative items and purchasing items at hobby shops and for baby showers. <br><br>Other spending included mundane items like bottled water. According to the data, House members and their staff spent more than $408,000 on bottled water alone; Deer Park certainly seems to be a favorite. <br><br>This is one of the first times aggregate data has been available for analysis, and while the House Clerk's office has attempted to make it available in a searchable format, it is far from perfect. The Reporting Group and Sunlight Labs spent several hours cleaning the data and had to manually manipulate the data to standardize names for this analysis. <br><br>The data also omits information that was previously available when disbursement records were released in bound books. The 2008 printed records show, for example, where a lawmaker or a staffer traveled, and provide information on whether the destination was the home district and the purpose for the junket. In 2008, for example, Rep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, reported that he, flew from DC to Ohio, while in the present logs similar travel line items only reads as, Commercial Transportation leaving out crucial details like the place visited.<br><br>Similarly, the old data cited the exact make or model of a computer purchased such as Sony Vaio while the current PDF version of the expenditure reports only says, Comp Hardware Purchase.<br><br>Here is a list of corporations that received the most money:<br><br>\r\n<table border=\"1\">\r\n<thead>\r\n  <th>Corporations</th>\r\n  <th>Total Amount</th>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody><tr>\r\n  <td>CDW Government Inc.</td>\r\n  <td>$8,102,342</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n  <td>Pitney Bowes</td>\r\n  <td>$7,773,558</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n  <td>Citibank</td>\r\n  <td>$7,582,694</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n  <td>Cisco Systems Inc.</td>\r\n  <td>$7,438,381</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n  <td>Lockheed Martin Desktop Solutions</td>\r\n  <td>$6,517,363</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n  <td>Verizon Wireless</td>\r\n  <td>$5,003,862</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n  <td>AT&amp;T</td>\r\n  <td>$2,139,834</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n  <td>Sallie Mae Servicing Corp</td>\r\n  <td>$1,918,773</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n  <td>Avaya Federal Solutions</td>\r\n  <td>$1,915,957</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n  <td>Dell Marketing LP</td>\r\n  <td>$1,814,945</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n<i>Data analysis conducted in collaboration with Roll Call.

All Coast Guard investigations are stored in the agency\u2019s <a href=\"http://cgmix.uscg.mil/IIR/Default.aspx\">Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement</a> (MISLE) database.<br><br>BP had 550 incidents in Mississippi Canyon, where the now infamous Deepwater Horizon drilling platform was located, according to Bill Allison of the Sunlight Foundation. But MISLE records about investigations and any resulting penalties can be obtained only by filing a Freedom of Information Act request for each individual incident. This means 550 separate FOIA requests would have to be filed to obtain details about the BP incidents in the area surrounding the site where BP\u2019s drilling rig exploded in April, he said.<br><br>\u201cTechnically, it\u2019s a database because you can request data from it,\u201d Allison said, referring to MISLE. \u201cBut you can\u2019t query or search the database. You have to already know what you are looking for in order to find it.\u201d <br><br>This makes tracking trends in the Coast Guard\u2019s policing of BP\u2019s\r\nactivity in Mississippi Canyon, nearly impossible, he said. \u201cWe would\r\nlike to look and see how often BP was investigated, fined, caused\r\ntrouble or had penalties, but we really can\u2019t do that the way the data\r\nis set up,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if we FOIA-ed, it would just get us a pile\r\nof paperwork which would be a hassle to go through compared to a query\r\non a database.\u201d<br><br>The MISLE reports are only accessible via FOIA\r\nrequests because the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 which oversees\r\nthe Coast Guard \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_pia_uscg_misle.pdf\">says</a>\r\neach report \u201ccontains sensitive personal information\u201d of people\r\ninvolved in investigations, including their Social Security numbers. In\r\naddition to oil spills, MISLE also contains information about shipping\r\naccidents, vessel boardings, pollution discharges, drilling rig\r\naccidents, and search and rescue operations.<br><br>Representatives\r\nfrom the Coast Guard declined to specifically comment on MISLE access,\r\nreferring questions to its FOIA webpage. According to the website, FOIA\r\nrequests are necessary to \u201cprevent individuals, businesses, and\r\ngovernment from harm resulting from the release of certain information.\u201d<br><br>Still,\r\nAllison believes there should be a way for the government to protect\r\npersonal information in the database while giving the public access to\r\ninvestigative reports and penalties assessed to oil companies for leaks\r\nand spills.<br>\u201cIt\u2019s just a silly way to run a database,\u201d he said.<br><br><p><b>ABOUT THE DATA </b></p><p><b>What:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE)</p><p><b>Where:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coast Guard/Department of Homeland Security</p><p><b>Availability:</b>&nbsp; Online database with 560 GB of data</p><p><b>Format:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General summary of information about each incident</p><p><b>Usability:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details about investigations, penalties must be requested via FOIA n/a </p><p><i>Send your tips on government data sets that you think should be\r\nmade more accessible or user-friendly to datamine@publicintegrity.org.\r\nYou can also message us on Twitter or discuss the project on our\r\nFacebook page.

(See <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/bad-dates-propublica-notes-lack-accuracy-campaign-finance-data/\">here</a> for an explanation.) Even when there's a disclosure intended to shed light on <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/data/LobbyistBundle.do?format=html\">fundraising</a> done by registerd lobbyists and PACs for congressional campaigns (called a 3L), linking these disclosures to a particular fundraising invitation is still a guessing game. <br><br>\r\n\r\nSo when the Washington Post used those disclosures to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2010/05/31/ST2010053100100.html?sid=ST2010053100100\">report</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2010/05/30/GR2010053003835.html?sid=ST2010053100100\">top bundlers</a>--individuals that collect campaign contributions in amounts of $16,000 or more on behalf of a campaign--we wanted to see if they turned up as hosts of fundraisers in our Party Time database (<a href=\"http://blog.politicalpartytime.org/2010/06/01/the-scene-of-the-bundle-top-lobbyists-found-in-party-time-database/\">some do</a>).<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut while we matched names of bundlers to names of hosts on fundraiser invitations, we didn't follow through to see if the campaign committees reported to the FEC whether that host bundled funds for their campaigns. <br><br>\r\n\r\nSo today we thought we'd see if we could match up 3Ls filed by campaigns with those invitations. Bear in mind that a 3L is a quarterly report--covering three months--and that no dates are listed for when bundlers turned in their bundles.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOf the campaigns that sent out some 50 fundraising invitations that listed a top bundler as a host, only 5 had filed a 3L report.

In the 2003 report, the company jumped a tier, contributing between $100,000 and $249,999. Comcast also upped its contribution, from between $30,000 and $49,999 in 2002 to between $50,000 and $99,999 in 2003.<br><br>\r\n\r\nViacom companies are listed as contributing between $20,000 and $44,998 in 2002, but in 2003 only Viacom was listed as contributing between $5,000 and $14,999. The NCTA donated between $5,000 and $14,999 in 2002 and 2003.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn addition, Comcast, the NCTA, Time Warner and Viacom are all regular sponsors of the caucus's annual legislative conference. In all, over the two years, those companies contributed as much as $589,991. </blockquote><br>\r\n\r\nThe New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/us/politics/14cbc.html\">reported</a> on the caucus' activities a while back:<br>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The caucus says its nonprofit groups are intended to help disadvantaged African-Americans by providing scholarships and internships to students, researching policy and holding seminars on topics like healthy living.<br><br>But the bulk of the money has been spent on elaborate conventions that have become a high point of the Washington social season, as well as the headquarters building, golf outings by members of Congress and an annual visit to a Mississippi casino resort.<br><br>In 2008, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation spent more on the caterer for its signature legislative dinner and conference \u2014 nearly $700,000 for an event one organizer called \u201cHollywood on the Potomac\u201d \u2014 than it gave out in scholarships, federal tax records show.</blockquote><br>\r\n\r\nMany of those interests <a href=\"http://www.cbcfinc.org/support-cbcf/cbcf-supporters.html\">still contribute</a> to the foundation (Comcast and Verizon between $100,000 and $249,999; AT&amp;T and Time Warner between $50,000 and $99,999). <br><br>Special interests in Washington have many levers to influence politicians; not all of them show up in FEC records, lobbying disclosure records or IRS forms 990s (filed by nonprofit groups like the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation).

Brian Higgins</a> office, of the 27th District of New York, got to work in August 2007 to broker a deal with the local transit system, the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority.<br><br>Within a couple months they got the lapse date extended for a year and had hashed out a perfectly legal solution that was known as \u201cthe switcheroo\u201d amongst those involved: The FTA would tacitly permit a transfer of the $11.8 million to the transportation authority to purchase 24 hybrid busses.<br><br>In return, the transportation authority would pay back the corporation the $11.8 million from their own grant allocations from the FTA with zero interest, said NFTA Chief Financial Officer Deborah Leous.<br><br>Higgins <a href=\"http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/ny27_higgins/pr090129.shtml\">widely publicized</a> the maneuver, calling it a save for Buffalo: \u201cAllowing these funds to vanish into the bureaucratic abyss of Washington was never an option,\u201d Higgins said in a statement when the deal was approved in January 2009. \u201cWith the help of the NFTA and people in Washington we fought to keep these resources here,\u201d he said again in October 2009 when the funds were officially repurposed to the transit authority.<br><br>Those involved see this as a win-win situation for Buffalo, but it\u2019s also a prime example of how communities and lawmakers deftly maneuver the earmark process, particularly when a particular earmark doesn't pan out, and would have been lapsed and been spent elsewhere in the country at the discretion of the FTA.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for a grantee, when they realize that an earmark may be lapsing to look for eligible ways to spend that money,\u201d said FTA spokesman Paul Griffo. <br><br>While earmarks are commonly written with an intended recipient in mind, only project titles actually appear in the language of the law, so any recipient that fits that project can apply. When an earmark is close to lapsing, transit officials notify potential recipients to spur them to utilize the allocation. <br><br>In prior years the lawmakers simply requested and got extensions on earmarks that didn\u2019t come to fruition, until a viable project could be found. In fact, the $11.8 million earmark for the Inner Harbor project already represented the combined total of a slew of older earmarks made by past New York lawmakers going back a decade. <br><br>\u201cOriginally those funds had come to an NFTA to do work on a transportation center in Buffalo, but because we couldn\u2019t get that project off the ground and didn\u2019t want it to lapse, it went to the City of Buffalo to use on an intermodal station which couldn\u2019t get off the ground. And then the money went to the Empire State Development Corporation, and they couldn\u2019t use it, and now it\u2019s back full circle to NFTA, and now I have to pay it back; But it was mine to begin with!\u201d Leous joked.<br><br>Despite the tortuous path, Leous said she had no problem with her transit agency entering into a memorandum of understanding with the corporation to pay the transit agency. After all, it allowed the transit authority to replace their aging buses at a faster rate than they normally would have, saving them on operation and maintenance costs. But Leous also said that they would have likely bought the buses in the coming years on their own. In 2008 for example, they had already purchased 13 hybrid buses. <br><br>\u201cAssuming that we could get money from grants or stimulus money, we would still be buying buses, this just helped to accelerate it,\u201d Leous said. \u201cWe\u2019re helping each other in the community, and then everyone benefits.\u201d<br><br>Rep. Higgin\u2019s Chief of Staff Andy Tantillo said that while the ideal situation would have included the intended recipient using an earmark for a viable project that actually got built before the money lapsed, the reality is that no community wants to pass up on funding.<br><br>\u201cIt would have been better if they could have been used immediately and for the projects stated in the appropriations bills,\u201d said Tantillo. \u201cBut the unacceptable outcome would have been to lose these funds that will produce jobs in Buffalo. At the end of the day our community purchased needed buses and the development at the Inner Harbor will move forward, and we were proud to help bring about that outcome.\u201d<br><br>", "date_published": "2010-06-01 14:27:12", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "disappearmarks-buffalos-switcheroo", "tags": "Disappearmarks, earmarks, Buffalo Inner Harbor, Federal Transit Administration, Transportation, FTA, Brian Higgins, earmark, disappearmark", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2114, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-06-01 09:51:36", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2010-05-31 18:19:16", "image": "", "title": "Study: Earmarks, federal spending follow political power, inhibit economic growth", "excerpt": "", "content": "<div style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><a href=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com:80/uploads/New_Chair.jpg\"><img src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com:80/uploads/New_Chair.jpg\" height=\"262\" width=\"242\"></a><div style=\"margin: 3px 0pt; font-size: 85%;\">Rep. James Moran takes the gavel</div></div><br>Year after year, the late John Murtha used his influence on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee to bring tens of millions of dollars in earmarks to his district--hard hit by the declining fortunes of the steel and coal industries--to in effect create a new economic base fueled on federal spending. Sen. Robert Byrd did the same for West Virginia.  But do such efforts actually work? Does spending taxpayer money spur private sector development?<br><br>A <a href=\"http://www.people.hbs.edu/cmalloy/pdffiles/envaloy.pdf\">new study</a> from researchers at the Harvard Business School suggests that the answer is no; that public spending doesn't stimulate private sector activity. The three authors, Lauren H. Cohen, Joshua Coval and Christopher J. Malloy, do so by measuring earmark and other spending going to states whose elected lawmakers have just landed powerful committee chairs. They find a correlation between the presence of a committee chair and a state's share of federal dollars:<br><blockquote>We focus specifically on the 232 instances over the last 42 years where the senator or representative of a particular state ascends to the chairmanship of a powerful congressional committee.  During the year that follows the appointment, the state experiences an increase of 40-50 percent in their share of federal earmark spending, and a 9-10 percent increase in total state-level government transfers.  The funding increase persists throughout the chair\u2019s tenure and is gradually reversed upon his departure.  </blockquote><br>Their analysis attempts to quantify something that many of us who follow earmarks have long thought:<br><blockquote>We show that becoming a powerful committee  chair results in a significant increase in federal funds flowing to the ascending chairman\u2019s state.  Thus, a congressman\u2019s ascension to a powerful committee chair creates a positive shock to his or her state\u2019s share of federal funds that is virtually independent of the state\u2019s economic conditions. </blockquote><br>The researchers conclude that after a state gets that positive shock, however, the private sector doesn't fare as well:<br><blockquote>...we investigate the private sector consequences of seniority shocks by studying the behavior of the public corporations headquartered in the congressman\u2019s state.  Focusing on the investment (capital expenditure), employment, R&amp;D, and payout decisions of these firms, we find strong and widespread evidence of corporate retrenchment in response to government spending shocks.  In the year that follows a congressman\u2019s ascendency, the average firm in his state cuts back capital expenditures by roughly 15%.  These firms also significantly reduce R&amp;D expenditures and increase payouts to their investors.  The magnitude of this private sector response is nontrivial: in the median state (which receives roughly $200 million per year in increased earmarks and federal transfers as a result of a seniority shock), capex and R&amp;D reductions total $39 million and $34 million per year, respectively, while payout increases total $21 million per year. These changes in firm behavior persist throughout the chairmanship and begin to reverse after the congressman relinquishes the chairmanship.  We also find some evidence that firms scale back their employment, and experience a decline in sales growth. </blockquote><br>A few concerns about the study--earmark data does not seem to be comparable over the period they're looking at (and remember, there was no real earmark disclosure prior to 2007).&nbsp; It's also not clear that the committee chairman positions they've chosen to study--which vary throughout the paper--are the most relevant to appropriations (for example, Rep. James Moran, D-Va., has never been chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, and <a href=\"http://moran.house.gov/list/press/va08_moran/chair.shtml\">only recently landed</a> the chairmanship of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, but he's certainly brought home a lot of pork to his district, which benefits from a <a href=\"http://www.fedspending.org/fpds/tables.php?tabtype=t1&amp;subtype=at&amp;rowtype=d\">huge amount</a> of federal contracts as well).<br>\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://politiwidgets.com/embed?w=earmarks&amp;bgd=M000933&amp;s=lg&amp;color=ECF9E9&amp;&amp;snapshot_id=127534397598293\"></script>\r\n\r\n<br>That said, the finding that the political power of individual members of Congress changes the flow of federal spending is well worth devoting further research to.

Reid will instead have to attempt cloture once again--most likely later today. <br><br>Among the Democrats who dissented were Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Sen.

The Wisconsin Democrat said the bill won\u2019t succeed in preventing another financial crisis like the one in 2008. He adds that the financial reform legislation hasn\u2019t addressed the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d problem that the country faced with the collapse of financial firms like AIG. <br><br>\u201cThe test for this legislation is a simple one - whether it will prevent another financial crisis.&nbsp; As the bill stands, it fails that test,\u201d Feingold said in a statement. <br><br>However, the bill does include provisions that limit the amount of credit exposure large institutions can have at one time, which can limit a bank\u2019s ability to be too big to fail. Additionally, the derivatives provisions in the bill are supposed to inhibit banks from taking on too much risk at once by making the trades transparent.&nbsp; <br><br>Yesterday\u2019s attempt at cloture was also missing a vote from the defeated incumbent Sen.

They're damning.<br><br>Schoolcraft, for example, recorded a fellow officer lamenting that he'd been instructed to downgrade a car theft to \"unauthorized use of a vehicle,\" as well as to find a way around reporting the thefts of a cell phone and video game system. In another recording, Schoolcraft captured the results as he voiced his concerns about crime stats manipulation to a unit within the department that audits such data. One officer with the unit acknowledged the political pressure to juke the stats. \"The mayor's looking for it, the police commissioner's looking for it...every commanding officer wants to show it,\" he said. \"So there's motivation not to classify reports for the seven major crimes.\"<br><br>In other words, the statistical manipulation extends beyond property crimes. Journalist Debbie Nathan, who was sexually assaulted in a city park last February, says that she was shocked to learn that the officers who wrote up her report <a href=\"http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2010/05/nypd_forced_to.php\">classified the crime as a misdemeanor</a>. It was later upgraded to a felony, but only after Nathan went to the district attorney. And according to the DA's investigation, the six officers who responded to Nathan's attack admitted leaving key portions of her story out of the report. As Nathan told the Village Voice, rape crisis centers throughout New York City have documented similar complaints from victims of sexual assault.</blockquote><br>Balko notes other problems as well (quotas for stopping pedestrians and subjecting them to searches or improper arrests); the Village Voice's coverage is available <a href=\"http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/the_nypd_tapes/\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-05-04/news/the-nypd-tapes-inside-bed-stuy-s-81st-precinct/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-05-11/news/nypd-tapes-part-2-bed-stuy/\">here</a>. <br><br>One of the interesting things about ", "date_published": "2010-05-18 15:12:26", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "bad-data-whos-watching-watchers", "tags": "", "is_published": false}}, {"pk": 2090, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-10-30 18:27:29", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 12, "timestamp": "2010-05-13 17:06:53", "image": "", "title": "Medicare data reveals nursing home abuse and neglect", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>\r\n\tResident #208 was found by inspectors at Capital Healthcare Center in Tallahassee, Fla., in a pool of urine. On July 16, 2009, inspectors found that the the resident -- who was incontinent -- hadn&#39;t been changed for five hours.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOther residents complained of ill treatment; one told inspectors he or she had fallen several times recently, and was then accused of faking those falls &quot;to get staff in trouble.&quot; (The reports hide the identities of those making allegations.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe reports go on. The facility was cited on multiple occasions for allowing pressure sores to develop on immobile patients, giving unnecessary catheters, allowing accidents and failing to meet residents&#39; nutritional needs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile Capital Healthcare Center appears to have cleared up some of these most egregious violations since last July, and fired the staff responsible for Resident #208&#39;s poor treatment last year, it remains on a short list of the nation&#39;s worst nursing homes, as identified annually by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The home is designated as a Special Focus Facility by CMS, which means it requires closer monitoring due to substandard performance. Less than one percent of the nation&#39;s nursing homes fall into this category.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll of the above information was available online, and all but the actual inspection reports quoted above can currently be found at <a href=\"http://data.medicare.gov\">data.medicare.gov</a>, the new portal for CMS&#39; &quot;Nursing Home Compare&quot; datasets. While the information was available online previously, it is now much easier to view, sort, filter and download. Similar datasets are also posted for hospitals, home health agencies, dialysis facilities and medical equipment suppliers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe information is broken up into slices. A general information file gives the name, address, and phone number of every nursing home in the country, along with the number of residents, an indication of whether the facility accepts Medicaid patients, whether the home is for-profit and whether it&#39;s part of a chain. Special Focus Facilities are also identified there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOther datasets list any health and safety &quot;deficiencies,&quot; as failures to meet federal standards are called. These files give the survey date, an explanation of the deficiency, how widespread the problem is, and how severe the harm, if any. A separate dataset measures staffing adequacy, based on how many hours each patient spends with a registered nurse, as well as with other staff, each day. The data can be sliced by state and zip code (though county isn&#39;t listed).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA quick look at Capital Healthcare Center&#39;s numbers will demonstrate how these datasets can be used. By importing the numbers into a database management program like Microsoft Access, we can see that the facility has been cited over 100 times in the past three-and-a-half years for failing to meet federal health and safety requirements. Ninety-nine percent of homes received fewer &quot;deficiencies,&quot; as these failures are dubbed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe can also see that Capital Healthcare tops the list of homes with the most citations for &quot;actual harm&quot; or &quot;immediate jeopardy&quot; to their residents in 2009 and 2010, the two highest levels of severity recorded by CMS. Capital Healthcare also racked up the most instances of &quot;actual harm&quot; that fell in three crucial categories: mistreatment of residents, quality of care, and residents&#39; rights. Among other things, the home was cited for failure to &quot;protect each resident from all abuse, physical punishment, and being separated from others,&quot; and for failing to keep or build &quot;each resident&#39;s dignity and self respect.&quot; The facility fares better on staffing levels; it falls within merely the bottom 40 percent of homes on its ratio of registered nurses to patients.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo what&#39;s missing from data.medicare.gov? A mandate in the health care reform act will fill in two crucial gaps. First, residents&#39; advocates stress caution when looking at the staffing numbers currently listed -- they&#39;re self-reported. By March 2012, these numbers will come straight from payroll data and cost reports. Second, the inspection reports quoted at the beginning of this story are currently only available piecemeal on some state sites. By March 2011, a link to each state&#39;s website, with the reports included, will be available through CMS.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the meantime, reporters can find a guide to which information each state offers on nursing homes at the advocacy group NCCNHR (originally the National Citizen&#39;s Coalition for Nursing Home Reform) online <a href=\"http://www.nccnhr.org/sites/default/files/advocate/policy-resources/Online-Nursing-Quality-State.pdf\">here</a>.

The request is for the FY 2011\r\nDepartment of Defense budget and will go to the Center for Mind-Body\r\nMedicine, run by Dr. James Gordon. <br><br>The money would fund a\r\nprogram that is aimed at helping health professionals in the military\r\nmaintain their mental and physical abilities in order for them to\r\neffectively and continually help troops suffering from post traumatic\r\nstress disorder, depression and suicidal thoughts.&nbsp; The program\r\nconsists of drug-free therapies.<br><br>Gordon specializes in\r\nalternative medicine. A passionate advocate of the field, he believes\r\nhis work is very effective. \"We help people help themselves. [The\r\npatients] are horribly traumatized,\" Gordon said.<br><br>But Gordon has been criticized by traditional practitioners. <a href=\"http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/gordon2.html\">According to Quackwatch.org</a>--a\r\nwebsite run by medical professionals that investigates claims made for\r\nvarious of alternative treatments--Gordon studied in the 1970s under an\r\neccentric Indian guru named Shree Rajneesh, a man the State Department\r\nidentified as a cult leader. Gordon supported Rajneesh for years and\r\nthrough many scandals. In the 1980\u2019s the guru was prosecuted for\r\npoisoning residents of an Oregon town who opposed his commune. Rajneesh\r\noriginally moved his commune to the United States due to an\r\ninvestigation by the Indian government for tax evasion. Gordon went on\r\nto teach Rajneesh\u2019s methods, which include twirling to the point of\r\nhallucination. <br><br>\r\nGordon says his critics come from a profession\r\nthat attacks anyone who wants to \"enlarge the medical model,\" and that\r\nhis past has been taken out of context. The bottom line for Gordon is\r\nthe work he's done. \"It's peer-reviewed and stands on it's own merits,\" Gordon said. <br>\r\n<br>The <a href=\"http://www.cmbm.org/mind_body_medicine_PRESS/Press/DOD_Grant-102208.pdf\">Center for Mind-Body Medicine has already received $411,000</a>\r\nfrom the Department of Defense in 2008 to conduct experimental,\r\ndrug-free, mental health therapies on soldiers returning from combat.\r\nAccording to Gordon, that DOD contract trained hundreds of medical\r\nprofessionals to help themselves through war-related trauma so they\r\ncould go on to treat others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe program Moran is seeking funding for in the upcoming budget is not\r\nrelated to this contract, but for a similar program.<br><br>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://politiwidgets.com/embed?w=earmarks&amp;bgd=M000933&amp;s=lg&amp;color=fbf9f9&amp;\"></script><br><br>Moran\r\nhas favored other organizations whose scientific credentials have been\r\nquestioned.

Tom Coburn, R-Okla., John McCain, R-Ariz., Russ Feingold, D-Wisc., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.,&nbsp; vastly improves the way in which information about earmarks is disclosed. The bill requires a centralized, detailed, downloadable database that would track every earmark requested. <br><br>While Congress has greatly improved the amount of information available about earmarks, it has not provided that information in user friendly formats. A single point of access to machine readable, standardized earmark data has been <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/update-on-earmark-disclosure/\">needed</a> since the House and Senate Appropriations Committees <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/01/06/inouye-obey-promise-earmark-reforms/\">announced</a> that they would require members to post their earmark requests online in 2009. It's been needed since the House and Senate started requiring, in 2007, that bills with earmarks list them separately, with the name of the sponsoring member identified. <br><br>In 2007, Laura Peterson of Taxpayers for Common Sense described the very first table of earmarks, released by the House Armed Services Committee as an image-file PDF, as having \"visual quality that would strain the eyes of Superman, much less daylight-deprived budget watchdogs.\" Sunlight offered <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/01/06/inouye-obey-promise-earmark-reforms/#comment-49336\">this prediction</a> of what disclosure would be like without a centralized, standardized format--one that proved <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/making-sense-of-online-earmark-disclosures/\">all too prescient</a> when we <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/links-to-house-earmark-disclosures-in-one-database/\">tried</a> to put links to all House requests in one database, or when our friends at Washington Watch <a href=\"http://washingtonwatch.com/bills/earmarks/\">tried to digitize</a> all fiscal year 2010 earmark requests. (Full disclosure: Sunlight funded Washington Watch's crowd-sourcing tool for collecting the data.) <br><br>Currently, there are four major types of earmark disclosure (requests, committee reports, certification letters, conference reports) scattered over more than 550 websites. Collating all that information for a single earmark is a <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/Earmarks-opinion/\">daunting task</a> (a problem President Barack Obama addressed in no less an occasion than his first State of the Union address). <br><br>Coburn's bill solves all these problems. Earmark requests, certification letters (in which members avow that neither they nor their spouses have a financial interest in the recipient of the earmark), funding amounts and more would all be disclosed in a single format, in two places (the websites of the House Clerk and the Secretary of the Senate) instead of 550-some places. <br><br>What's more, the Earmark Transparency Act will&nbsp; a tremendous amount of information about earmarks that, to date, we've only been able to infer. For example, some projects receive earmarks year after year--members would have to disclose whether a request is a one-off project or an ongoing project supported solely by congressionally directed spending requests. Members will also have to identify whether recipients are for-profit, non-profit or governmental bodies. They'll have to indicate how long a project is likely to run, why it's a reasonable use of taxpayer funds, and whether other funds (for example, state or local tax dollars, or private funds) will also be used to complete the project. <br><br>Roll Call reported on the Earmark Transparency Act <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/issues/55_130/news/46052-1.html\">here</a>. <br><br>Full disclosure: Sunlight provided input on the bill, largely based on the Reporting Group's real world experience of trying to use earmark disclosures in our work. <br>", "date_published": "2010-05-11 09:14:31", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "start-making-sense-earmark-transparency-act-will-finally-bring-t", "tags": "", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2086, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-05-06 11:38:46", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 5, "timestamp": "2010-05-06 10:49:55", "image": "", "title": "More transparency sought from White House\u2019s OMB in regulation reviews ", "excerpt": "", "content": "Under President Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s, the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/\">White House Office of Management and Budget</a> became known as the place where promising new regulations died&nbsp; behind closed doors.

The Sunlight Foundation thought it would be interesting to examine which earmarks, after all the Congressional debate and bluster has dispensed, actually get spent.<br><br>We thought a good example would be the $23 billion in transportation earmarks from SAFETEA-LU, The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users. The act authorized spending on highways, transit systems, port facilities, bus routes and other projects from its passage in August 2005 to what was supposed to be its expiration in September 2009. Earlier this year, Congress renewed SAFETEA-LU temporarily, and then the Act was extended to the end of 2010 in the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act on March 19. Nevertheless, most of the projects funded by the 6,306 earmarks in the original act should be completed or nearing completion. <br><br>Additionally, since the earmarks fell to the Department of Transportation, specifically the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration, it would seem easier to request such agency-specific information than other for other acts that include earmarks for multiple departments and agencies\u2014for example, one appropriations bill funds the Labor, Education and Health and Human Services departments, plus a large number of related agencies. <br><br>So we approached Transportation and started asking about earmarks. After a bit of negotiation, the Federal Highway Administration disclosed data on unspent FHWA earmarks\u2014we will publish that in a future post. The Federal Transit Administration also kept such records, but we had to file a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain a copy of their earmark and earmark grant report from the last five years. Specifically we asked for data under the government\u2019s internal Transportation Electronic Award and Management (TEAM) system that showed \u201cearmark identification numbers that are tied to an obligated project identification number.\u201d<br><br>In government lingo, an \u201cobligated project\u201d means that there is a binding agreement in place for the federal agency to promise to pay for an approved project in a community. While there is a separate designation for when the money is actually spent, known as disbursements or outlays, for all intents and purposes, finding the obligated amount is a good indication that a project will be funded.<br><br>A few weeks later, we were delighted to receive a positive response from the FTA. But were not so delighted that it came in the form of a 121-page paper printout of what obviously is a database that could have been transmitted electronically. Our FOIA request, of course, asked for the information to come in an electronic format. So we asked again for an electronic copy, and were told that there was no way we would get it.<br><br>Realizing we would have to scan each page and use optical character recognition software (OCR) to turn paper into data, we put the project on hold for some months. When earmark season rolled around this year, we asked yet again for an electronic copy, and were told that it couldn\u2019t happen. So we set to scanning each page and cleaning up the data. Anyone that\u2019s tried to OCR a document might understand what a frustrating experience this can be. Not only do you have to match up columns and rows, you have to make sure every little detail was scanned accurately \u2013 so that a zero didn\u2019t appear as the letter \u201cO\u201d or that a slight smudge didn\u2019t suddenly become a decimal point.<br><br>And there was another issue: the data we have is six months old, and it is always possible that those earmarks without obligations might have been funded in the last six months. When we asked the FTA\u2019s media relations staff if we could get an updated copy of the database, we were told that we had to submit another FOIA.<br><br>Several hair-tearing weeks later, armed with an OCR\u2019d spreadsheet (albeit six months old), we began working with the data to see what could be analyzed. We realized quickly that we needed to talk to someone at FTA who works directly with this data to fully understand what we had. When we finally got hold of someone, we learned that the original response to the FOIA we submitted was sent to the FTA FOIA office as an Excel spreadsheet.<br><br>The FOIA office, following protocol, made hard copies of that spreadsheet, and sent it on to us. The reason for the use of paper, explained FTA spokesman Paul Griffo, is to ensure that if there is any information in the spreadsheet that was deemed not to be viewed by the public, a hard copy would allow the FOIA and press offices to black out or redact the data. <br><br>But nothing in my data was deemed redact-worthy, yet still I could not get an electronic copy. The program office graciously gave me an up-to-date electronic copy of the earmarks data and I marveled how one click of a send button in a government office could bring me such joy.<br><br>But upon analyzing what was, and was not, obligated, I ran into several stumbling blocks. I was given two spreadsheets: one that had 7,300 rows that were just earmarks, and another that was about 6,200 rows that was just grants. I was told that any earmark that showed up in the grants table and had a listed obligation date indicated that the grant was either partially spent, or all spent. Those without obligation dates were never spent. It\u2019s still unclear what happened with those 1,000-plus earmarks that don\u2019t appear in the grants database at all.<br><br>After calling several grant recipients with no listed obligation date, I learned that many of the grants had in fact been obligated. The data was telling me one thing, but the recipients from large metropolitan transit agencies from across the country were telling me something entirely different.<br><br>I did find some very interesting earmarks that never got spent \u2013 which will be detailed in <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/earmark-disappearmark-policy-shift/\">accompanying posts</a>, but without fully clean and accurate data, it would be irresponsible to write about this database in aggregate. The program office admitted that the data wasn't perfect. Sometimes different people enter in different things. Sometimes you have to work with multiple internal databases that only FTA employees would have access to.<br><br>And after weeks of communication with the program office, I was told the magic words: That the FTA did keep a separate list of just those earmarks under SAFETEA-LU that never got spent. However, I would have to file another FOIA.<br><br>So this part of this story ends where it begins: The Freedom of Information Act. In the coming weeks we hope to get that FOIA response, and we\u2019ll be sharing every agonizing moment with you \u2013 so that you too can learn the joys of obtaining and analyzing government data.<br>", "date_published": "2010-05-04 12:25:18", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "case-study-trying-analyze-earmark-data-first-series", "tags": "earmark, disappearmarks, FTA, Federal Transit Administration, Transportation, FOIA, Freedom of Information Act, disappearmark, earmarks", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2084, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-06-08 15:23:59", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 11, "timestamp": "2010-05-03 16:52:57", "image": "", "title": "From earmark to disappearmark: Bush administration policy shift cut funding for congressional projects", "excerpt": "", "content": "<div style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><a href=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com:80/uploads/chapelhill.jpg\"><img src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com:80/uploads/chapelhill.jpg\" width=\"242\" height=\"194\"></a><div style=\"margin: 3px 0pt; font-size: 85%;\">Rep.

David Price, D-N.C., <a href=\"http://price.house.gov/list/press/nc04_price/031005a.shtml\">earmarked</a> more than $19.6 million to launch a light rail project in his district\u2014one that he had promised to continue his \u201cstrong support for\u201d by finding additional federal funding though his position on the House Appropriations Committee.<br><br>The light rail project was authorized by SAFETEA-LU, a law enacted in 2005 that was notable for the billions in earmarks it funded\u2014including questionable projects like the \u201cbridges to nowhere\u201d in Alaska and the <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2006/06/14/dennis-hasterts-real-estate-investments/\">Prairie Parkway</a> in Illinois.<br><br>Yet the light rail project Price sought funding for was never built. In fact, dozens of projects for which funds were earmarked were never started. While the final number of unspent transit earmarks under SAFETEA-LU has yet to be determined (we are awaiting a response to a pending Freedom of Information Act request with the Federal Transit Authority for the latest data -- <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/case-study-trying-analyze-earmark-data-first-series/\">more here</a>), the Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group uncovered a few of these unspent projects using other data we requested from the Agency. <br><br>North Carolina\u2019s Research Triangle is located in the heart of North Carolina, which lies in Price\u2019s district. Its name comes from the large number of high tech firms and research universities in the region, and it\u2019s also home to explosive population growth, which has led to, among other things, traffic snarls and congestion. U.S. Census estimates show that the Raleigh-Durham-Cary region grew 32 percent from 2000-2009, making it the fourth fastest growing metropolitan area in the country. One solution to the heavily congested corridor between the state's capital of Raleigh and the city of Durham, was constructing light rail. With help from a $19.6 million earmark secured by Price that became a reality \u2013 at least back in 2005.<br><br>SAFETEA-LU, the massive transportation act that authorized hundreds of billions of dollars of spending on transportation projects, included $6.6 billion in funding for more than 330 projects across the country that qualified as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.fta.dot.gov/planning/newstarts/planning_environment_2607.html\">New Starts</a>\u201d projects, which included light rail, commuter rail, rapid rail and bus rapid transit projects among others. <br><br>Price lauded SAFETEA-LU\u2019s coming benefits in a <a href=\"http://price.house.gov/list/press/nc04_price/031005a.shtml\">press release</a> after the House passed the bill in 2005: \u201cI\u2019m pleased that so many Triangle constituents will directly benefit from the funding,\u201d he was quoted in the release as saying. \u201cThis is an important step forward in our efforts to meet the transportation needs of our rapidly-expanding communities.\u201d <br><br>But just a year into the Triangle Transit Authority project, Bush Administration changes to the way that New Starts projects were evaluated put brakes on the project. According to the FTA, even before SAFETEA-LU was signed into law, the Bush Administration declared that it would limit New Starts funding recommendations to projects that scored a \u201cmedium\u201d or higher rating for cost-effectiveness. <br><br>Officials at Triangle Transit, who had been planning the project for years, were hopeful that it would still move forward. But by 2006, it became increasingly clear that the stronger emphasis placed on cost-effectiveness over other factors such as improved mobility or environmental benefits would win out. They just missed the \u201cmedium\u201d benchmark, scoring only a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.carolinajournal.com/exclusives/display_exclusive.html?id=1597\">medium-low</a>\u201d based on the new criteria.<br><br>As a result, the project was withdrawn and never approved by the FTA. Traffic still backs up for miles on I-40 between Raleigh and Durham, and the $19.6 million in earmarks set aside for this project expired in 2008 and sits in FTA ledgers unspent.<br><br>\u201cThe past administration\u2019s actions to continually change the rules affecting criteria were damaging to the Triangle region,\u201d said the Authority\u2019s General Manager David King last month. \u201cThe changes reduced a project\u2019s costs and benefits to a single, crude measure.\u201d<br><br>Rep. Price\u2019s spokesperson did not return our calls for comment.<br><br>Seven hundred miles away in Detroit, similar problems dogged planners at the <a href=\"http://www.semcog.org/\">Southeast Michigan Council of Governments</a> \u2013 a group of local governments who received a $4.9 million New Starts earmark in 2006 to start work on a commuter rail between Ann Arbor and Detroit.<br><br>SEMCOG finally got funding thanks to Michigan <a href=\"http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/release.cfm?id=249155\">Sens. Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow</a>, and was just starting the initial planning for their New Starts project when they were told that the criteria for funding had shifted to cost-effectiveness, essentially killing their project. <br><br>Their funding had been tied to the successful completion of an \u201calternative analysis\u201d which the FTA uses to evaluate New Starts corridors. Under alternative analysis, the community is informed of the benefits, costs and impacts of a proposed project and local and regional leaders must sign off on the plan before the project can become part of the region\u2019s long-range transportation plan. It was in this phase of the project that SEMCOG learned of the Bush Administration changes.<br><br>\u201cThe [money] was tied to the successful completion of an alternatives analysis, which we didn\u2019t rate high enough. When we got into the analysis game, [the rules] changed at least twice\u2026 and we weren\u2019t able to finish,\u201d said Carmine Palombo, the director of transportation planning for the Council. Their earmark was never spent and expired in 2008.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for a true New Starts project to compete with all these started projects. It\u2019s just not fair.\u201d<br><br>While the project isn\u2019t going forward as a New Starts project, Palombo said that they did receive earmarked money in the last few years to develop a demonstration project for their proposal using transit money outside of New Starts. They hope to \u201cjump back into the New Starts process at some point,\u201d Palombo said.<br><br>Another new rail project by planners at the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority faced a similar fate when their earmarked an initial $3.9 million for a rail project between Philadelphia and Reading, Pa., known as the <a href=\"http://www.septa.org/reports/pdf/capbudget08.pdf\">Schuylkill Valley Metro</a>, was quashed.<br><br>Since the funds were earmarked funds submitted by Rep. Jim Gerlach, R-Pa., and Sen. Arlen Specter, D-Pa., they could not be transferred for any other SEPTA project, said spokesperson Jerri Williams. That earmark also expired unspent in 2008.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.hklaw.com/id77/biosJBOOTHE/\">Jeff Boothe</a>, a partner at the law firm Holland and Knight in Washington, D.C., who lobbies for the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?lname=New+Starts+Working+Group&amp;year=2008\">New Starts Working Group</a>\u2014made up of 65 transit authorities and organizations\u2014said that in addition to the policy shift, a number of New Starts projects were also cut off in 2007 because the then outgoing Republican-controlled Congress failed to pass a transportation appropriations bill in 2006, and the incoming Democratic-controlled Congress passed a continuing resolution with no earmarks in it. Without the earmarks, the Bush Administration was able to roll up any unspent money, and only award funds to projects that met their new criteria of cost-effectiveness.<br><br>The Bush Administration also put greater emphasis on bus rapid transit (BRT) systems that place buses on a dedicated right-of-way, Boothe said. As president, Bush oversaw the creation of the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.fta.dot.gov/planning/newstarts/planning_environment_222.html\">Small Starts</a>\u201d and the \u201cVery Small Starts\u201d programs that encouraged and promoted the use of BRT. \u201cWhere projects got funded out of Small Starts, they were all bus rapid transit,\u201d Boothe said.<br><br>\u201cWhen the Bush Administration did this because Congress did not issue any earmarks in 2007, there were a lot of unhappy communities,\u201d said Boothe. \u201cThere were only 7 or 8 recipients that got funding from unearmarked monies and a lot of cities who didn\u2019t get things like routine bus replacement needs met saw a fair amount of unhappiness.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIn the case of Triangle Transit,\u201d which is a member of the New Starts Working Group, \u201cit was in the final design phase and they had an expectation the project would go forward to construction, but the rules got changed on them,\u201d Boothe said. \u201cThey were the only project that was that far along in the New Starts process that had to step out and address those changes in FTA policy. And consequently, the project was set back. They should have been able to go forward.\u201d<br><br>In January 2010, the <a href=\"http://www.fta.dot.gov/planning/newstarts/planning_environment_11045.html\">FTA announced</a> a proposed dramatic shift away from the Bush Administration policy under President Obama\u2019s directive. U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced new funding guidelines be based on livability issues such as economic development opportunities and environmental benefits, in addition to travel cost and time saved as the primary criteria. <br><br>Where the Bush Administration placed 50 percent of its decision on cost-effectiveness, the Obama proposal would only be 20 percent, Boothe said. Under the Bush Administration the decision was a simple pass-fail--if a project did not score a medium it would not go forward. The new plan calls for a medium-low project or a low rated cost-effectiveness to be offset with economic development and good land use decisions, Boothe said.<br><br>For Triangle Transit planners, there is hope that some form of New Starts mass transit will finally see the light of day. They are currently working on proposing new plans for a New Starts project in their region.<br><p></p>", "date_published": "2010-05-04 12:24:58", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "earmark-disappearmark-policy-shift", "tags": "earmark, disappearmarks, FTA, Federal Transit Administration, Transportation, David Price, Triangle Transit, disappearmark, earmarks", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2083, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-05-03 12:34:18", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2010-05-03 12:15:46", "image": "", "title": "Bad dates: ProPublica notes lack of accuracy in campaign finance data", "excerpt": "", "content": "ProPublica's Sebastian Jones <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/feature/campaign-contribution-records-are-open-but-hardly-transparent\">notes</a> what for us has been one of the most maddening features of campaign finance data: the dates don't mean very much at all. Campaigns report when they receive money, and political action committees report when they donate it. In theory, those dates should match, but as Jones points out, they don't:<br><blockquote>The Federal Election Commission [3] requires politicians to disclose the dates and amounts of contributions they receive in periodic reports. Corporate and special interest political action committees (PACs) are also required to file reports with the FEC, disclosing the money they contribute. \"In a perfect world, they match up,\" FEC spokesperson Mary Brandenberger told ProPublica.\r\n\r\nBut when we compared those records for the Springsteen fundraisers, two problems emerged. Most of the dates the politicians said they got the money differed significantly from the dates the PACs said they disbursed their contributions. And many of the expenditures the lawmakers disclosed in their reports were so vaguely described that they were almost meaningless.\r\n\r\nWe began our search with an advantage, because some invitations to the Springsteen fundraisers were leaked to the nonprofit Sunlight Foundation\u2019s <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/party/16254/\">Party Time website</a>. Sunlight\u2019s list represents only a small fraction of the fundraisers held in Washington each year, so there may have been more fundraisers at Springsteen concerts \u2013 there\u2019s simply no way of knowing for sure.\r\n\r\nWith the invitations in hand, we began plowing through the records, but in no time at all, something seemed odd: the lawmakers reported surprisingly few contributions on the dates of the concerts \u2014May 18 and Nov. 2, 2009. Even expanding our search to include contributions made near the dates of the fundraisers yielded few additional matches.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat's a problem we've had since we launched the Party Time site. I'm told by some people who work in campaigns that \"date\" is interpreted rather loosely--it can be the date that a contribution was received, the date it was deposited in the bank, the date that the information was entered into the campaign's internal databases for tracking contributions, or some other date altogether. Compounding the difficulty is the fact that lobbyists and others who attend fundraisers don't necessarily write their checks on the day of the fundraiser, lobbyists have told me. They might show up with a check. They might have sent it in a month in advance. And they might send it two weeks after the event. So following the money from dates is difficult--really we're operating within quarters or half-years, and can't get any more precise than that.\r\n\r\n", "date_published": "2010-05-03 12:09:16", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "bad-dates-propublica-notes-lack-accuracy-campaign-finance-data", "tags": "ProPublica, \"campaign finance\", dates, \"Party Time\", Fundraisers", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2082, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-04-30 14:22:11", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2010-04-30 14:22:11", "image": "", "title": "Grab a shovel and help Data Mine dig ", "excerpt": "", "content": "From my colleagues at the Center for Public Integrity: <br><br>The Data Mine, a project of the Center for Public Integrity and Sunlight Foundation, needs your help to excavate federal data that should be accessible to the public or easier to use.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires CMS to post links to inspection reports by March 2011. Currently, they\u2019re only available piecemeal, on some states\u2019 websites, and at the facilities themselves.

This project part of which which was initially released in 2006 creates mash-ups that can be used by scientists to analyze surface-water systems using geographic information systems (GIS). For instance, one of the data sets on the website is the stream network, which shows the position of a water source with reference to a nearby drainage network.<br><br>Another database EPA released recently provides funding sources for projects that protects water sources, called the <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/owm/cwfinance/cwsrf/\">Clean Water State Revolving Fund</a> \u2013 the largest federal funding program for wastewater infrastructure projects across the nation. Currently, an <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/owm/cwfinance/cwsrf/cwsrf_arra.pdf\">updated pdf file</a> gives a summary of the grants as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act going to specific towns and cities, along with award date, effective date and construction start date. <br><br>Similarly, the <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/safewater/dwsrf/allotments/funding_dwsrf_allotments_2010_final.pdf\">Drinking Water State Revolving Fund</a>, which installs, upgrades and replaces infrastructure to ensure a supply of safe drinking water has published its 2010 grant data on its site. Currently, California is getting the largest funding of $126 million, followed by New York with $89 million out of the entire $1.3 billion funds available. <br><br>An interesting dataset in the works is the <a href=\"http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=203458\">In</a><a href=\"http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=203458\">tegrated Climate and Land Use Scenarios</a>, which uses a years' worth of population and demographics data to anticipate future patterns in housing density. If accurate, this data can tell us a lot about the environment generations will inherit and the consequences for air quality, human health, water quality and ecosystems. <br><br>Lastly, the Green Vehicle Guide provides vehicle ratings based on emissions and fuel economy and has been updated to include 2010 models. For instance, users can see that the <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/Detailsresult.do?vehicle_ID=118508\">greenest vehicles</a> in the city are compact four-doors Chevrolet Heritage High Roof that received a 7 out of 10 on an air pollution and greenhouse gas scoreboard. <br><br>Although not OGD related, there are two datasets that caught my eye, both these can be personalized for each user. If you\u2019ve ever wondered how clean the air you breathe is, you can now find out just by entering your zip code on a<a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/myenvironment/\"> website maintained by the EPA</a>. You can get air quality index, toxic air pollutants, county mortality data and county low birth weight. <br><br>Another dataset showcased on this site is the Toxic Release Inventory and includes a map of chemical releases and waste management facilities in any area.

The Center for Constitutional Rights and two other groups filed a lawsuit on April 27 attempting to force ICE to turn over data about its \u201cSecure Communities\u201d program after failing to get the information through a Freedom of Information Act request.<br><br>\u201cThis program has very little public scrutiny. There\u2019s very little known about the way it operates,\u201d said Sunita Patel, an attorney at the <a href=\"http://ccrjustice.org/\">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>, a non-profit legal organization that joined the FOIA lawsuit. <br><br>The <a href=\"http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/factsheets/secure_communities.htm\">Secure Communities program</a>, launched by ICE in October 2008, gives local police the power to compare fingerprints of&nbsp; individuals taken into custody with FBI and U.S. Department of Homeland Security immigration databases. The fingerprint cross-checking program now operates in at least 160 communities, and ICE plans to expand it to every jail in the United States by 2013.<br><br>The program is operating in the shadows, Patel says, and the Homeland Security immigration database is riddled with errors.&nbsp; Another concern of the civil rights groups is whether Secure Communities encourages racial and ethnic profiling by police \u2013 an issue that critics of the Arizona law have also raised. Arizona's controversial new immigration enforcement law requires police to question people about their immigration status if there is \"reasonable suspicion\" they are in the United States illegally. <br><br>The new lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, asks ICE to disclose any racial profiling complaints, how such complaints are handled, the cost of the program, how officials prioritize the identification of \u201cdangerous criminal aliens,\u201d whether local communities can opt out of the program, how agreements between local police and ICE are reached, and whether there is any Congressional or agency oversight.<br><br>\u201cWe believe that without this information there\u2019s no way to make a sound decision around whether this program should even be expanded,\u201d said Patel. <br><br>An immigration law clinic operated by the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/aOJ9Oq%20%3Chttp://bit.ly/aOJ9Oq\">Cardozo School of Law</a> in New York and the National Day Laborer Organizing Network joined the FOIA lawsuit. The groups filed their first FOIA request on Feb. 3, 2010.&nbsp; \u201cWe haven\u2019t received what we requested. We have not received responses to the request,\u201d said law student Brooke Menschel. <br><br>ICE spokesman Richard Rocha said he could not explain why specific data from the Secure Communities program is not available to the public. Rocha told the Center he would try to find out what FOIA information has been given to the advocacy groups, or if the agency has a timeline to provide it.<br><br>ICE\u2019s website <a href=\"http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/factsheets/secure_communities.htm\">describes</a> the Secure Communities program as a public safety initiative \u201dto better identify criminal aliens, prioritize enforcement actions on those posing the greatest threat to public safety, and transform the entire criminal alien enforcement process.\u201d<br><br>The <a href=\"http://ccrjustice.org/files/SC_Complaint_REAL_FINAL.pdf%20\">lawsuit</a> said details about the ICE program should be released \u201cto facilitate meaningful public discourse and increase government transparency\u201d as well as to help state and local government officials make \u201cappropriate decisions about implementing the program and conducting oversight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHow can the public hold the program accountable if we don\u2019t have information?\u201d said Menschel. <br><br><p><b>ABOUT THE DATA: </b></p><p><b>What:</b> Lobbyist Bundler Disclosure Database</p><p><b>Where:</b> Federal Elections Commission Web site, <a href=\"http://fec.gov/data/LobbyistBundle.do?format=html\">here</a></p><p><b>Availability: </b>Accessible&nbsp; to the public</p><p><b>Format:</b> Non-searchable .PDF</p><p><b>Usability:</b> Non-searchable files, some handwritten and some illegible </p><p>Send your tips on government data sets that you think should be made more accessible or user-friendly to <a href=\"mailto:datamine@publicintegrity.org\">datamine@publicintegrity.org</a>.

These additional payments are handed out when a hospital takes on an unusually expensive case.<br><br>This takeaway comes from a quick review of the Center for Medicare and \r\nMedicaid Services (CMS)' \"<a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Dashboard/10_CMSDashboardBETA.asp#TopOfPage\">Dashboard</a>,\"\r\n a new online repository of spending data.<br><br>While the Dashboard is still in its beta version, and currently only has inpatient data (no home health or nursing home information, for example), a few points stood out.<br><br>From January 2006 through September 30, 2009, three states -- Alaska, Hawaii and California -- and the District of Columbia routinely received the highest dollar amounts in outlier payments when adjusted for total patient volume. <br><br>Here's a snapshot of the dollar amounts each state received in the last quarter of fiscal year 2009, adjusted by the total number of patients seen.<br><br>(Again, click on the picture to see a larger version.)<br><br><a href=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com:80/uploads/Outliers2009Q4.JPG\"><img src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com:80/uploads/Outliers2009Q4small.JPG\"></a><br><br>Another interesting way to look at this data is to ask what percentage of all the dollars a state's hospitals spent on health care is going to these outlier payments. Is the state spending a lot of money on health care in general, or just on the expensive cases? When you look at it this way, you'll notice that Wyoming stands out.<br><br>(Click for larger version.)<br><br><a href=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com:80/uploads/PercentOnOutliers.JPG\"><img src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com:80/uploads/PercentOnOutliers-small.JPG\"></a><br><br>It remains to be seen why hospitals in certain states are spending so much on expensive services, but as <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/ogd-future-medicare-data-looks-promising/\">Medicare rolls out additional data</a>, it'll become easier to find out. A cluster of these outliers can form for many reasons. There may be a higher number of severely ill people in a particular region, requiring long hospital stays. A certain hospital may be more expensive, perhaps because it's a teaching hospital and tends to track more complicated cases.<br><br>Medicare's <a href=\"http://oig.hhs.gov/\">Inspector General (IG) Office</a> has conducted several investigations into outlier payments as possible sources of fraud or abuse. <a href=\"http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-08-00570.pdf\">One of the most recent</a>, in December 2009, found that one county -- Miami-Dade in Florida -- accounted for more outlier payments for home health care in 2008 than the rest of the country combined. The report called for further investigation into the matter.<br><br>A few simple additions would enable us to get to the bottom of this question. Currently, the data is only available on a statewide basis. A county-level view, or better yet, information on individual hospitals, would enable reporters to look for patterns much as the IG's office did. Also, data is needed on the age of the patient population, which bears heavily on cost. This was likely a factor in the Miami-Dade case, for example. Finally, CMS needs to include other types of facilities in its future releases, such as nursing homes, home health and outpatient services.<br><br>This is just a preview of what reporters will be able to do with Medicare data over the coming months. Another excellent site that CMS presented this month is <a href=\"http://data.medicare.gov/\">data.medicare.gov</a>, an interactive site that includes information about quality of care. Some of that data is presented for each hospital.

It\u2019s intended to fend off any future government bailouts and prohibit the risky behavior banks participate in that caused the 2008 financial meltdown.

Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark.,</a> is planned to be folded into <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.opencongress.org%2Fbill%2F111-s3217%2Ftext&amp;h=2258b\">the bill Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., proposed</a> this week on financial reform. If this bill makes it through, it will limit banks\u2019 ability to become too big to fail, as AIG was in 2008. <br><br>The bill attempts to regulate more than $200 trillion of derivatives market and will prohibit back door Wall Street deals and force real time reporting of derivatives trades or purchases that take place. The derivatives market is described as the shadow market or the finance industry\u2019s plumbing. This legislation has the potential to make this process transparent and reduce the possibility of big Wall Street banks from collapsing and destroying small community banks and businesses across the country. It will decentralize power and reduce the occurrence of banks being so inflated with money that just one can bring down the entire global economy by changing the ways banks buy and trade derivatives. <br><br>Derivatives trading generally take place behind closed doors and without bank regulators knowing the details. This practice ties the various industries together, such as housing and credit cards, and works to move money around the nation and the world. <br><br>Currently, the five largest commercial banks in the U.S. (JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs) hold 97 percent of the U.S. derivatives market on their balance sheets, according to the Office of Comptroller of Currency. These banks are connected to everything, from major airline fuel purchases to the 2nd mortgage on your house. Financial analyst and author of <a href=\"http://freerisk.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\">riski.us</a>, Cate Long, points out that this is where some major problems lay. <br><br>According to Long, JP Morgan Chase, for instance, is invested in the credit card market, the housing market, The Bank of England, Abu Dhabi\u2019s finances and countless other financial endeavors. If JP Morgan Chase gets in trouble, the world would feel the effects, just as was the case for AIG. The reform legislation would likely change that. <br><br>Lincoln's Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 will also require all transactions to go through a clearinghouse like Intercontinental Exchange, Inc., or ICE. Previously, this wasn\u2019t required for all transactions. ICE owns the world\u2019s largest credit-default swap clearinghouse and will likely benefit from this legislation.

Now Roberson will lobby the bill\u2019s outcome in the Senate, after he worked to form the legislation in the House. <br><br>Despite the heavy lobbying and campaign donations coming in, Lincoln\u2019s proposed legislation is still likely to force the nation\u2019s biggest banks to change the way they do business and make the economy safer for consumers and small banks in the future. <br><br>Up until this legislation, all of the government\u2019s efforts to fix the economy have been very short sighted, according to critics. The profits the Department of Treasury is taking in from its TARP investments have been viewed as a positive indicator of the state of the economy. For instance, Treasury's plan to sell its shares of Citigroup's common stock at a likely profit of $8 billion has been called a smart move on the part of the government. <br><br>To compare, TARP is estimated to cost $99 billion, according to the <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10871/Chapter1.shtml#1101368\">Congressional Budget Office</a>, while $213 trillion is at risk in derivatives market held by U.S. commercial banks. The TARP costs and risks pale in comparison to the risks derivatives pose. Globally, derivatives amount to $604.6 trillion.<br><br>Irresponsible gambling in the derivatives market is what caused AIG\u2019s near collapse in 2008 and forced the Bush Administration to label it \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and rescue it. According to Long, the bailout led to a \u201clong term destabilization of the economy,\u201d and in fact \u201cinstitutionalized the idea of too big to fail.\u201d Long says we have to push derivative transactions \u201cout of the dark and into the light.\u201d Doing so would open up the market and ensure fair trading prices for securities and commodities. The Senate Agriculture Committee agrees with her. <br><br>The current economic state of Greece and California are good examples of \u201cmini-meltdowns\u201d that are \u201cindications of what could be on the horizon,\u201d if things don\u2019t change, Long said.<br><br><br>", "date_published": "2010-04-21 14:32:13", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "wall-street-transparency-and-accountability-act-2010-moves-senat", "tags": "Derivatives, Financial Reform, Chris Dodd, Blanche Lincoln, TARP", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2064, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-04-21 10:36:06", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 14, "timestamp": "2010-04-21 10:10:46", "image": "", "title": "BLM fights to keep secret names of ranchers with grazing permits", "excerpt": "", "content": "Public land grazing elicits some pretty damning declarations. Former Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt once called livestock grazing \u201cthe most damaging use of public lands.\u201d And conservation groups, like <a href=\"http://www.wildearthguardians.org/\">WildEarth Guardian</a>s, go further: \u201cLivestock production is the most widespread and destructive activity on . . . western landscapes.\u201d<br><br>And yet, little is known about permit holders authorized to graze sheep, cattle, goats, and horses on millions of acres of federal public lands in 16 states.<br><br>WildEarth Guardians, based in Sante Fe, N.M., is embroiled in a protracted legal battle to obtain the names of permit holders from the <a href=\"www.blm.gov\">Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM)</a>, which oversees public land grazing. The battle dates back to August 2007, when WildEarth Guardians and another conservation group filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking copies of all livestock grazing permits and the names and addresses of permit holders. The BLM eventually referred them to its <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/ras/\">Rangeland Administration System</a>, a publicly searchable database on grazing allotments. But that database does not include names and addresses of every grazing operator permitted by BLM.<br><br>Last September, the conservationists sued the BLM in federal court in Idaho for violating FOIA and, as the complaint states, \u201cimproperly withholding and failing to disclose information and documents related to . . . grazing permittees.\u201d<br><br>Without names and addresses, advocates say, it\u2019s virtually impossible to know who is using federal public lands for grazing, how many animals are involved, and on how many allotments. In short, no one can develop a profile of the typical public rancher. Yet the BLM administers a massive grazing program\u201418,000 permits for nearly 16,000 livestock operators using 138 million acres of public lands\u2014that comes at a steep price. <br><br>In 2005, in fact, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that 10 federal agencies spent $144 million managing such grazing programs, yet collected only $21 million in grazing fees. Conservationists and taxpayer organizations have mocked that it costs more to feed a cat or a goldfish than the $1.35 fee per animal unit month that ranchers pay to graze livestock on our public land. Ranching interests argue that public land has been used for grazing since the birth of the United States, and that cattlemen serve as public land managers who help government agencies cut costs and preserve open space of the West. <br><br>But potential land damage is what worries environmental advocates, who blame livestock grazing for contributing to the rapid \u201cdesertification\u201d of the West. \u201cIt\u2019s important to know who is involved in federal public lands grazing,\u201d says Mark Salvo, of WildEarth Guardians, who has written about the threat to endangered species caused by the activity. \u201cBut without the entire list, it\u2019s hard for anyone to figure out the big picture.\u201d<br><br>A spokesman for the BLM said the bureau would not comment on pending litigation.<br><br>In its FOIA response in 2008, the BLM declined to provide permit holder names and addresses because such a disclosure, it wrote, \u201cwould constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u201d Last October, officials backpedalled somewhat and gave the conservationists information on 6,000 commercial permit holders, who arguably have no privacy rights. But that still leaves the identities of as many as two-thirds of the grazing permit holders in the dark. In its latest court filing, in November, the BLM claims that the personal privacy exemption covers the remaining names because they represent \u201cfamily owned businesses or closely held entities.\u201d<br><br>But conservationists aren\u2019t buying the argument. After all, the <a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/\">U.S. Forest Service</a> gave WildEarth Guardians the names and addresses of 10,000 permit holders\u2014commercial and otherwise\u2014authorized to graze livestock on national forest lands in response to a similar FOIA request. Besides, according to the conservationists\u2019 lawsuit, the BLM has already handed out this information in the past to sympathetic industry groups like the <a href=\"http://www.beef.org/\">National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association</a> and the Public Land Council. In its court filings, the BLM acknowledged that it \u201cmay have disclosed personal information about permittees to FOIA requesters\u201d prior to 2005, when the bureau adopted new rules prohibiting disclosure of contact information for ranchers who describe themselves as small, private operations.<br><br>\u201cThey obviously have the information,\u201d Salvo says. \u201cThey just won\u2019t release it.\u201d<br><br><b>ABOUT THE DATA:</b><br><br><b>What:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Identities of livestock grazing permit holders<br><b>Where:</b>&nbsp; Bureau of Land Management<br><b>Availability:</b>&nbsp; Not available to public<br><b>Format:</b> N/A<br><b>Usability: </b>N/A<br><br>Send your tips on government data sets that you think should be made more accessible or user-friendly to <a href=\"mailto:datamine@publicintegrity.org\">datamine@publicintegrity.org</a>.

That level of detail might answer important questions. For\r\ninstance, was the interest rate lowered or did the lender allow a\r\ncertain amount of the principal to go in forbearance? This sort of\r\ninformation might also reveal how the modified loans performed over\r\ntime. But Treasury hasn\u2019t released it. </p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\u201cThe data they\u2019re\r\ncollecting under this program provides insights into how well the\r\ngovernment is functioning, areas where it could be improved\u201d says\r\nErnst. Releasing that data, he said, would help \u201cpeople monitor if the\r\nprogram is being implemented fairly and tracks how taxpayer money is\r\nbeing deployed.\u201d</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Ernst said he\u2019s confirmed that the\r\nTreasury Department is taking concrete steps to put out the data by\r\nthis summer. But a spokeswoman for Treasury would neither confirm nor\r\ndeny that the data would be released. Spokeswoman Meg Reilly noted that\r\nTreasury already publishes online progress reports on the modification\r\nprogram.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>The Data Mine is not alone in hoping the Treasury\r\nDepartment releases more specifics on HAMP. The House Committee on\r\nOversight and Government Reform started looking into the effectiveness\r\nof the program a couple of months ago. Committee Chairman. Edolphus\r\n\u201cEd\u201d Towns (D-N.Y.) sent a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy\r\nGeithner with six pages of questions asking for some of the same\r\ninformation. The committee\u2019s inquiry is ongoing. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>About the Data:</h3>\r\n\r\n\t<p><b>What:</b> Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP).<br><b>Where:</b> <a href=\"http://makinghomeaffordable.gov/modification_eligibility.html\">http://makinghomeaffordable.gov/modification_eligibility.html</a><br><b>Availability:</b> Detailed data on HAMP not released to the public.<br><b>Format:</b> Not available.<br><b>Usability:</b> Records from lenders on borrower eligibility, underwriting, incentive payments, property verification, terms of original loan, type of modification, performance of modification over\r\ntime. <br><b>More categories on:</b> <a href=\"https://www.hmpadmin.com/portal/docs/hamp_servicer/hampdatadictionary.xls\">https://www.hmpadmin.com/portal/docs/hamp_servicer/hampdatadictionary.xls</a></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Send your tips on government data sets that you think should be made more accessible or user-friendly to <a href=\"mailto:datamine@publicintegrity.org\">datamine@publicintegrity.org</a>.

For example, I was able to quickly compare two U.S. counties: Marin County in northern California, and Buffalo County in central South Dakota. Anecdotally, we know that Marin County is pretty affluent while Buffalo County is known as the poorest county in the United States based on per capita income.<br><br>Using the tool, those facts get greater context when you consider that 80 percent of Buffalo County is low income and lives greater than one mile to a grocery store, while only 3.4 percent of Marin County\u2019s population is. <br><br>The tool still has some shortcomings. It\u2019s not easy to figure out what \u201cnull\u201d and \u201cundefined\u201d mean in the returned results for example. The site also may present some challenges to those not used to querying databases and there are occasional freezes and error messages. Users also have to read the <a href=\"http://ers.usda.gov/foodatlas/documentation.htm#supercenters\">documentation section</a> carefully to really get a sense of what they are looking for. One great thing about the site however is that the data in the tool is available for <a href=\"http://ers.usda.gov/foodatlas/downloadData.htm\">bulk data downloads</a> into an excel spreadsheet.<br><br>Two other datasets that the Agriculture Department plans to release to Data.gov include the <a href=\"http://agclass.nal.usda.gov/download.shtml\">National Agricultural Library Thesaurus</a> in English and Spanish which contains 78,000 agricultural terms, updated each January since 2002. While the thesaurus is probably useful to those that work directly in agriculture, it is interesting to learn that the parasitic wasp <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphelinidae\">Aphelinidae</a> is known as the Ablerus in Spanish, and No. 1748 to the Department of Agriculture. Also in the thesaurus is an entry for \u201cabnormal behavior,\u201d known as No. 1750 to the department. Among its related terms are \u201cbehavior disorders,\u201d \u201cmental health,\u201d and \u201ccannibalism.\u201d And in Spanish, it\u2019s known as \u201cconducta anormal.\u201d<br><br>The last dataset Agriculture plans to release to Data.gov is the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Participating and Cost Data for each WIC state agency. The data contains monthly information for this federal food assistance program such as the number of pregnant women, breastfeeding women and post partum women and their average food cost and the administrative costs to run the program.<br><br>While these three datasets from Agriculture are useful, only the Food Environment Atlas is new. The <a href=\"http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/wicmain.htm\">WIC database</a> is already public, and the Agricultural Library Thesaurus has been public since 2002. And Agriculture counts the Spanish version of the thesaurus as a separate dataset, so their count is four instead of three. <br><br>The map, thesaurus and WIC data will likely be added to Data.gov in June 2010. They will join <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/catalog/raw/category/0/agency/20/filter/type/sort/page/1/count/25\">three other databases</a> that Agriculture added to the site in January: the Census of Agriculture Race, Ethnicity, and Gender Profile Data; the Feed Grains Database; and the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 22.

It's a leap for an agency whose previous offerings were a confusing mishmash of poorly-labeled files.

It's a good tool for quickly grasping the big picture; you can view data as a bubble chart, for example, which makes it easy to see changes over time. The information is available by state, diagnosis type and hospital (at least up to the top 10 hospitals in each state), and can be downloaded in a spreadsheet. But more granularity will be needed to make this truly useful for journalists. Adding county-level data, for instance, would allow comparisons by community. Also, looking at the top 10 hospitals by state is of limited use when there are hundreds of hospitals in California alone.<br><br>There's also a new and improved interface up at <a href=\"http://data.medicare.gov\">data.medicare.gov</a>. That site allows you to compare the quality of care at various facilities. More on that in a later post. <br><br>The details about the rest of CMS' new datasets are less clear, but a couple of them look very promising. For example, a new claims database is due out in September. The plan is to take a sample of five percent of the traditional Medicare population, strip all personal identification data out, and present it by service type (inpatient, outpatient, home health, prescription drug, etc). The claims will be accompanied by demographic data, although its not clear exactly what this will mean. It could allow comparisons by ethnicity, income level, and age. Hopefully, we'll actually be able to see how much we're spending on various segments of the population.<br><br>Another dataset that looks exciting and should be available by the end of the year is a large set of <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/open/datasets/communityhealthdata.html\">community health indicators</a>. CMS says the survey will include \"hundreds (ultimately thousands)\" of measures of health care quality, costs, diseases and types of services received. This is the kind of data that could potentially answer questions like: as a young woman living in Brownsville, Texas with suspected breast cancer, how likely are you to be given an MRI rather than a mammogram?&nbsp; How about if you're living in Marin County, California? These figures could be invaluable for public health analysis, as they'll include obesity rates, smoking rates, etc., paired with costs and utilization of services. <br><br>As with the other data Medicare's got in the hopper, though, the key will be the level of granularity it contains. Currently, they say county-level data is \"possible,\" and we'll dig in as soon as it's made available. <br>", "date_published": "2010-04-12 15:28:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "ogd-future-medicare-data-looks-promising", "tags": "HHS, CMS, Medicare, Medicaid, ogd, \"Open Government Directive\", health, health care", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2055, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-04-12 18:59:33", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 7, "timestamp": "2010-04-12 13:50:49", "image": "", "title": "US-Poland Defense Policy at a Glance", "excerpt": "In the wake of Poland\u2019s April 10th plane crash that killed President Lech Kaczynski and top military officials, all cultural and sports events were stopped, but the government will keep functioning.

The borrower was Hawaii Superferry Inc., a <a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=4d124f23-03bb-4c4a-97ac-911a911e7c63\">politically connected company that</a> hired a former chief counsel and deputy administrator of MARAD, among others, to lobby the agency. In 2005, Hawaii Superferry got a taxpayer-guaranteed loan for $139 million to build and operate a pair of high-speed ferries in the fiftieth state. Just four years later, the company filed for bankruptcy, listing assets of a mere $1 million. <br><br>The failure was par for the course for a program that even the business-friendly administration of George W. Bush branded as an \u201cunwarranted corporate subsidy.\u201d As of August 2009, the Title XI portfolio of outstanding loans totaled $2.4 billion. <br><br>According to its Web site, the U.S. Maritime Administration supports the merchant marine and the U.S. shipbuilding and waterborne transportation industries. It does so in part by prohibiting foreign shippers from accessing many American waterways. It provides U.S.-flagged ships and domestic shipyards direct funding, tax shelters and tax breaks, as well as financing programs. The agency has also managed, according to reports from Inspectors General and the Government Accountability Office, to leave taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars for projects that have gone bust.<br><br>Consider Title XI, the Federal Ship Financing Program that granted Hawaii Superferry the loan guarantee. Title XI has been plagued by loan defaults for decades, losing close to $3 billion since the 1980s due to multiple loan defaults. After 1986, when defaults caused losses of a record $1.2 billion, the program was suspended, only to be reinstated in 1993. In 1999, American Classic Voyages, owned by Chicago real estate billionaire Sam Zell, launched an ambitious, plan to expand its operations beyond its New Orleans and Hawaiian routes with $1 billion in Title XI funding. When the plan failed and the company went bankrupt, taxpayers ended up on the hook for $330 million. <br><br>The high profile failure of American Classic Voyages led to new scrutiny of MARAD\u2019s Title XI program. Then-Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., had supported American Classic Voyages\u2019 bid to win the taxpayer-guaranteed loan because he wanted a shipyard in his state, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=Career&amp;type=I&amp;cid=N00003329&amp;newMem=N&amp;recs=20\">run by Northrop Grumman</a> , one of Lott\u2019s largest career campaign contributors, to build the company\u2019s cruise ships. <br><br>Sen. John McCain called the program a waste of taxpayer money and an \u201cegregious example of pork barrel spending.\u201d President Bush took the unusual step of providing no new funding for the program in his 2002 budget. The director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mitch Daniels, labeled the program an \u201cunwarranted corporate subsidy.\u201d<br><br>Transportation\u2019s Inspector General launched an audit, completed in 2003, which found that \u201cMARAD needs to improve administration and oversight in all phases of the Title XI loan process.\u201d The report also identified a number of areas where MARAD could improve its practices to limit the risk of default, and reduce losses to the government.&nbsp; A second audit, completed in 2004, reported that MARAD had created policies that would address the concerns of the inspector general; the agency still had considerable work to do to implement them.<br><br>Loan guarantees issued by Title XI slowed drastically in years following the default of American Classic Voyages. Hawaii Superferry received the only guarantee issued in 2005 and the last one until 2009. Disclosure records show the company lobbied Congress and MARAD in 2005 regarding ship financing and Title XI amid the program slow down. <br><br>The company hired <a href=\"http://www.blankrome.com/index.cfm?contentID=10&amp;bioID=8764\">Blank Rome LLP</a> to push its interests in Washington; among the firm\u2019s lobbyists that represented Hawaii Superferry was <a href=\"http://www.martindale.com/Joan-M-Bondareff/352833-lawyer.htm\">Joan Bondareff </a>, who served as chief counsel and acting deputy administrator for MARAD during the Clinton administration . She\u2019d also served as the majority counsel to the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. Blank Rome reported receiving $20,000 in fees from Hawaii Superferry in 2005; the company got a taxpayer-guaranteed loan for $139 million to pay for construction and operation of a pair of <a href=\"http://www.austal.com/index.cfm?objectID=81CFADC0-A0CC-3C8C-D9A4EB77C2506543\">high-tech catamarans</a>. <br><br>Construction of the ferries was completed in 2007, but before they could begin operations, Hawaii Superferry ended up in a fight over whether it needed to complete an environmental impact survey assessing, among other things, the impact that a high-speed, 107-meter long catamaran would have on marine mammals. The ferry company refused to do the assessment, setting up a battle between island politicians and environmental activists. <br><br>Gov. Linda Lingle, who backed the project, shepherded a law through the legislature in 2007 that would allow the ferries to operate without completing the environmental impact statement, and further stated that the boats could operate no matter what the survey found, even if they had completed it.<br><br>In March 2009 the Hawaii State Supreme Court struck down the law exempting Hawaii Superferry from completing an environmental impact statement, and forced the company to suspend service. The company then filed for bankruptcy in May 2009, raising the prospect of a major default that could leave taxpayers holding the bill. <br><br>According to court documents, after liquidating all assets, Hawaii Superferry, Inc. will only have about $1 million available to distribute to creditors. Though MARAD has little to no chance of recovering any of the money it has guaranteed and the company is in bankruptcy, as of this writing the agency hasn\u2019t officially recognized the loan as being in default. When that does happen, an official at MARAD said, plans will be made to start making payments on the $139 million loan.<br><br>The two ferries have a book value of only $2.8 million, and were delivered to MARAD. They were used recently to aid the relief effort in Haiti. In the past, MARAD has had trouble maintaining foreclosed ships it has possession of, thus limiting the chances of recovery even further. For example, the 2003 inspector general reports notes that MARAD didn\u2019t monitor the physical condition of a ship it intended to sell for nearly $800,000. The ship was stored in a wet berth and exposed to hurricanes causing extensive damage. The sale price of the ship had to be reduced from $793,000 to $100,000. The payout on the loan guarantee was $1.8 million.<br><br>\u201c[MARAD is] concerned about the future of the vessels and hope that they will be put to good use,\u201d an official with the agency told us. Another MARAD official said that, in cases like this in the past, the ships were either sold or attempts were made to put them back to their original use.&nbsp; <br><br>MARAD doesn\u2019t believe the bankruptcy by Hawaii Superferry, Inc. will have any impact on the future of Title XI.<br><br>Calls to Lehman seeking comment regarding the bankruptcy were not returned. <br><br>A third IG audit is currently underway.<br><br><br>", "date_published": "2010-04-12 11:00:27", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "The agency has also managed ... to leave taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars for projects that have gone bust.", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "government-agency-history-taxpayer-losses-keeps-it", "tags": "\"Hawaii Superferry\", MARAD, \"U.S. Maritime Administration\", \"John F.

In the 111th Congress, we've seen enormous discipline on both sides of the aisle on a series of high profile votes. Our hunch is that the leadership of both parties has something to do with that, and understanding what levers they have--whether it's funding earmarks, supporting their campaigns with money, appearing at fundraisers or through other means that we still can't track with the current state of congressional disclosure--is something we want to follow in the coming months.<br><br>We began this exploration by looking at earmark requests made by key figures in the health care vote. We did a much less-noticed <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/cao-two-other-republicans-ignore-house-gop-earmark-moratorium/\">item</a> about Rep. Joseph Cao, R-La., the lone Republican to vote for the original House health care bill and who is defying the House Republican's one-year moratorium on making earmark requests. We'll also be looking at how earmark requests of incumbents with serious challengers compare to members in safe districts. And there's long been anecdotal evidence that appropriations are one of the means used to gain votes for legislation--for example, the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/22/AR2007032201883.htm\">various pot sweeteners</a> included in a 2007 Iraq war funding bill that would have set a hard time line for withdrawal. We'd like to see if, with the current state of disclosure, we can link those pot sweeteners to particular members.<br><br>But we clearly got the tone of the piece wrong, which is why we have <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/after-health-care-vote-stupak-11-request-34-billion-worth-earmar\">revised the story</a> to better reflect our intentions. Here's what we got wrong in our post tracking earmark requests made by the Stupak 11: <br><br>1) We should have been clearer in the headline and at the top of the story that all members, and not just&nbsp; Rep. Bart Stupak and his ten colleagues, were due to release their requests the day after the health care vote. We implied that the requests and the vote were directly connected; we were wrong to--the requests are just one part of a process we are trying to follow. We should have stuck to the question of how the Appropriations Committee and leadership would handle those requests rather than try to answer it with the information we had at the time. And we should have been clearer that we're looking at how leadership gets rank and file lawmakers to toe the line, with the Stupak 11 as just a potential case study for that phenomenon.<br><br>2) The spreadsheet that accompanied the story--one we put together to accompany the piece--had four major errors: Earmarks for Rep. Charlie Wilson for 2010 and 2011 were increased by a factor of ten, as were FY2011 earmarks for Rep. Steve Dreihaus. So too were FY2011 earmarks fro Rep. Kathy Dahlkemper, which led to our erroneously listing her as one of five members who increased the dollar amount of earmarks requested from 2010 to 2011. <br>&nbsp;<br>We apologize for these erroneous numbers. We went through this process using calculators, excel spreadsheets and Google spreadsheets, double and triple checked numbers, but did not catch the inaccuracies that occurred when we plugged our numbers into a table for publication. We should have been more rigorous with our fact checking process given the challenges of dealing with this difficult data. In any case, we issued corrections to the spreadsheet and story <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/editors-note-correction-stupak-11-post/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/correction-and-update-our-stupak-11-post/\">here</a>.<br><br>3) When you get anything wrong, one of the first things you do is go back and make sure that you haven't made any other mistakes. We have revised the numbers in the original story to accurately reflect the amounts of earmarks members have requested. In some cases, it has been impossible to go back and reproduce all the numbers we originally published on Friday. We are not certain, but it appears some published lists of earmarks might have changed since we did the original story. One example: We used the following formula to import Rep. Paul Kanjorski's earmark requests into a Google spreadsheet:<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">=ImportHtml(\"http://kanjorski.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1720&amp;Itemid=129\",\"table\",4)</span><br><br>When we checked the number on Tuesday, March 22, we got a total of 67124509, or $67 million, which appeared in the spreadsheet we published with the story. Today, using the exact same Google formula, the number comes in at 122220794 or $122 million. Kanjorski isn't alone--whether we tally earmarks by hand reading them to one another using a calculator, or go to great lengths to change the text into machine readable data, we get different results for some members. We've emailed Kanjorski's office for clarification but have not heard back. Similarly, we originally calculated Rep. Marcy Kaptur's total earmark requests for FY2011 at $290 million; when we recalculated the number on Wednesday, we found about $36 million more. Again, we're awaiting a response from Kaptur's office.<br>", "date_published": "2010-04-01 09:00:00", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "stupak-11-post-what-we-did-wrong", "tags": "Corrections", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2046, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-03-31 18:16:34", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2010-03-31 17:05:58", "image": "", "title": "After health care vote, <del>Stupak 11 request billions in earmarks</del> members turn to earmark requests ", "excerpt": "", "content": "[Note: this post has been<a href=\"../../../../2010/editors-note-correction-stupak-11-post/\"> corrected</a> and revised]<br><br><del>A\r\nday after Rep.

The expanded coverage also provides 100% job search allowance of a maximum $1500 and relocation allowances with a lump sum of up to $1500. It also extends cash payments by 26 weeks to 130 weeks for workers getting full-time training. The TAA program covers 80 percent of a worker's monthly health insurance premium.

To that end, we've whipped up EasyHighCharts, a bit of JavaScript easy enough for anyone to insert into a blog post that automatically turns a table full of numbers into a dynamic chart of your chosing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here's an example. Click the toggle button to see what the original table looked like. (The toggling between graph and underlying table is present on all graphs generated by this tool, so your table will still be available to readers.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And here's the code that created it: \r\n</p><pre>EasyHighChart('datadisplay','spline', '');</pre>\r\n<p>Pretty managable, huh?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, a couple of other things. The 'datadisplay' part is the ID of your table, and tells EasyHighCharts that you want that table turned into a graph. If you look at the HTML view of your post in your blogging software, you should see that a table looks something like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><table>\r\n<tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>\r\n<tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>\r\n<tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Note the id=\"XXX\". Make sure your table has one of those. Next in that single line of code, 'spline', is where you specify the type of chart you want. The options are: ['bar', 'stackedbar', 'percentbar', 'column', 'stackedcolumn', 'percentcolumn', 'scatter', 'area', 'stackedarea', 'percentarea', 'spline', 'pie']</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You'll notice that although we've specified 'column' chart, some of the data is displayed as a line. That's because while we've told the chart to make column the default, if we want more flexibility, we can specify that a column\r\nor row in the table should appear as a different chart type. That's what we've done by adding class=\"bar\" to the TD code for the column header.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Finally, while it's true that a single line of code creates the table, you need to paste a couple more lines in.

Todd Tiahrt (R-Kan.). \"To suggest having a staffer on personal time attend his boss's fundraiser is in some way improper is absurd,\" said Tiahrt spokesman Sam Sackett.<br><br>The chief of staff to the late Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.), who died on Feb. 8, regularly received campaign contribution lists and was the first reviewer of earmark requests, the report said. A Murtha aide responded Saturday that the review was cursory, however, and covered only a fraction of the requests.<br><br>The campaign manager for Rep. Peter J. Visclosky (D-Ind.) in March 2008 solicited funds directly from defense-related companies that wanted the lawmaker's earmark support, one report added, quoting from a lobbyist's e-mail. </blockquote><br>Again, the Ethics Committee concluded that \"the evidence showed that earmarks were evaluated based upon criteria independent of campaign contributions, such as the number of jobs created in the Members district or the value to the taxpayer or the U.S. military, and without Members or their official staff linking, or being aware that companies may have intended to link, contributions with earmarks.\" Blindfolds all around...<br>", "date_published": "2010-03-07 08:57:36", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "members-staffers-both-sides-chinese-wall-between-earmarks-fundra", "tags": "", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2021, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-03-25 14:29:38", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 5, "timestamp": "2010-03-04 23:10:48", "image": "", "title": "Farm Subsidies Still Missing from USDAs Data-Rich Website", "excerpt": "", "content": "<br><br>Farm subsidies have a way of inciting people.

We made that transfer in December.\"<br><br>All the state's reserves and rainy day funds are expected to be used over the life of the two-year budget, including 100 percent of the education rainy day fund, Ruhl said. The budget, which runs through June 2011, was built on revenue projections that haven't panned out, setting up the need to drain the $1 billion in state reserves.</blockquote><br><br>This raises a couple of questions:<br><br>Does this impact the appeal of Indiana's Gov. Mitch Daniels, who's <a href=\"http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZjZiMTIxOTVmZWE3OTJiY2EyMWJmODIzYTk0MTBjZjA=\">keeping his options open</a> to run for the Republican nomination in 2012? Part of that appeal has been his <a href=\"http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDMzY2IxMzMxMTQwNGI0M2NlYjkxNjc2NzE0NmExYjc=\">fiscal record as governor</a>: <br><blockquote>Daniels eradicated a $1 billion shortfall, beginning in 2005 and built up an even bigger rainy-day fund  $1.3 billion. He pared government spending, sold a toll road to private investors at an enormous profit, and attracted new business to the state. Revenues are off steeply, so he will use $300 million of the surplus in fiscal 2010 so that taxes won't rise in a recession. Revenues, which are below 2007 levels, aren't expected to recover soon. The rainy-day fund will last through June 30, 2011.</blockquote><br>As to the stimulus, how well (or poorly) was it designed if funds under the act could be used in lieu of (rather than to supplement) state funding? <br><br>The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education of the State of Indiana <a href=\"http://download.recovery.gov/recipient/Y09Q4/IN_Y09Q4.xls.zip\">reported</a> that 9,924 jobs funded by the stimulus to Recovery.gov, but none of those jobs are necessarily new jobs, and it's not clear that they're \"saved jobs\" either (the state has some money--state money being diverted to rainy day funds--to pay the salaries). Does this explain, in part, why the stimulus has not made much of a dent in unemployment? But doesn't it also make the program look more effective if Indiana's education jobs are counted in the total?<br><br>And finally (we've written about this <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/Onefifth/\">before</a>) how meaningful is that 594,754 jobs figure on the Recovery.gov Web site?<br>", "date_published": "2010-03-02 17:45:59", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "indiana-stimulus-grows-rainy-day-fund", "tags": "\"Stimulus\", \"Recovery Act\", \"Recovery.gov\", \"Mitch Daniels\", \"Indiana\", \"unemployment\"", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2014, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-06-03 11:43:05", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 3, "timestamp": "2010-02-27 17:36:57", "image": "", "title": "How are House members spending taxpayer money?", "excerpt": "", "content": "The House of Representatives released its tabulations of members' office expenses--including personnel costs, travel, district office expenses and vehicle expenses--last Friday, and the Sunlight Foundation turned the 3,000 page PDF into a searchable database, enabling reporters and curious constituents to do easy aggregation. <br><br>Here are some snippets from the data:<br><br>-- Appropriations was the highest spenders among committees, totaling more than $4.6 million in the last quarter of 2009, followed by the Oversight &amp; Reform and Energy &amp; Commerce committees with just over $3 million each. <br><br>-- In addition to technology-related companies and suppliers such as Dell and Microsoft, the House also hired some leading government contractors such as Pitney Bowes Governement Solutions, Lockheed Martin and Deloitte -- each of these companies have received close to $500,000 in the last quarter of 2009. <br><br>-- House offices--including members, committees and legislative offices--spent more than $222,000 of taxpayer money on bottled water during that same time period. <br><br>The database contains records for all offices of members of Congress,\r\nlegislative offices (like the House Clerks Office) and House\r\ncommittees and can be downloaded <b><a href=\"http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/projects/expenditures/\">here</a></b>.\r\n\r\n<p>Note that the data has not been standardized (meaning that AT&amp;T\r\nmight also appear as A.T.&amp;T.), so aggregation on the Payee and\r\nRecip fields may not return complete totals.\r\n</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>", "date_published": "2010-03-02 16:56:17", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "how-are-house-members-spending-taxpayer-money", "tags": "", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 2012, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-03-25 14:30:27", "override_byline": "Nick Schwellenbach", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 5, "timestamp": "2010-02-26 14:22:39", "image": "", "title": "Pentagon Weapons Test Report Harder to Get Since 9/11 ", "excerpt": "", "content": "Until Sept. 11, 2001, a little-known but indispensible annual report by the Defense Department gave the public a window into whether the tens of billions of taxpayer dollars spent each year led to weapons that work.&nbsp; Then, the reports by the Pentagons director of Operational Test and Evaluation were pulled from the website.<br><br>In the case of this specific report, the thinking was, why advertise that our weapons dont work, said Tom Christie, who was director of the test office from July 2001 through January 2005.&nbsp; The office was created by Congress to examine if weapons worked as well and as safely as claimed by the contractors that built them.&nbsp; Christie favors restoring the reports to the Pentagons website as a way to hold weapons programs accountable.

Many worked on health issues as Hill aides, garnering policy chops on the issues that matter to health insurance companies, medical professionals associations, and pharmaceutical companies. But they also have easier access to their former colleagues on Capitol Hill.<br><br>As Nancy Pelosi's chief of staff, Judith Lemons served continuously as the House Speaker's right hand for 15 years, leaving her position in 2002. Then she took a lucrative position at K Street powerhouse Dutko Worldwide, where in 2008 she lobbied for GlaxoSmithKline, which paid her firm $160,000 as part of an astonishing $7 million lobbying budget for the year, and Medtronic Inc., which paid Dutko $200,000. Last year, she worked on a half-million dollar contract with the Coalition to Advance Healthcare Reform. With her long, extremely close relationship with Pelosi, it's human nature that her connections to the office will get her easier access and a friendly ear.  \n<br><br>In lobbying for GlaxoSmithKline, Lemons was joined by Lindsey Toohey, who had served as senior health policy advisor to Sen. Kent Conrad before joining Foley Hoag LLP. &nbsp;According to a <a href=\"http://us.gsk.com/html/healthcare/healthcare-reform.html\">policy paper</a> on its web site, the pharmaceutical giant \"opposes a government-run health plan option that would compete with private plans\" yet seeks to \"require individuals to obtain health insurance coverage.\"\n<br><br> Conrad's decade-long chief of staff, Robert van Heuvelen, meanwhile, jumped ship in 2007 and now represents the Health Industry Group Purchasing Association, which paid Van Heuvelen Strategies\t$70,000 last year. \n<br><br>In making opening remarks at the health care summit, Sen. Lamar Alexander rejected Democratic proposals, saying \"this is a car that can't be recalled and fixed and that we ought to start over.\" His former health policy advisor, Page Kranbuhl, is on the payroll of Stryker Corp., a medical device manufacturer whose \"ability to sustain margins superior to the industry is questionable when considering the Companys legal problems and uncertainty surrounding healthcare reform,\" as a stock analyst <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/179089-stryker-corporation-an-opportunity-or-a-trap\">wrote</a> in December. \n<br><br>Sens. Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin each have seven former staffers who became registered lobbyists and have at one time or another represented clients in the healthcare industry. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has six, and Sen. <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/06/22/the-max-baucus-health-care-lobbyist-complex/\">Max Baucus</a> has five.

Since\r\n1982, federal criminal justice expenditures have exploded from <a href=\"http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/expgov.cfm\">$4.2\r\nbillion to $36 billion</a>, according to the Bureau\r\nof Justice Statistics, with Bureau of Prisons spending rising 20-fold\r\nand still leaving penitentiaries overcrowded.&nbsp;</p><p>The dire situation has led some\r\npoliticians to introduce bills to reduce the federal prison\r\npopulation this Congress; it's conceivable that real-time\r\ninformation-sharing made possible by recent technology could\r\nhelp achieve consistency in sentencing without the judicial\r\nhand-tying.</p>\r\n<p>Having the data available in a downloadable format does more than allow analysis showing increasing conviction rates, spending on prisons and fluctuations of the crime rate--all crucial information for assessing the performance of the system. Real time reporting of the data might ease one of the principal factors exacerbating the problem: Judges could compare their sentences to those of their colleagues, eliminating the need for sentencing guidelines and mandatory minimums.</p><p><b>Congress, crime bills and consequences</b><br></p><p>Written during an election year in the\r\nmidst of a crime wave, the 1984 Sentencing Reform Act established\r\n\"sentencing guidelines\"--a matrix that, taking input such\r\nas the crime and level of cooperation, provided narrow ranges within\r\nwhich judges were required to sentence offenders. It created the U.S.\r\nSentencing Commission, an independent agency that sets the guidelines\r\nand advises the White House and Congress on federal crime policies.\r\nThe act also took the radical step of eliminating parole in the\r\nfederal system.</p>\r\n<p>The act was designed to produce\r\nfairness through consistency, using a point system to calculate\r\nsentences based on certain metrics, thereby ensuring that an offender\r\nin one courtroom didn't get a term that differed widely from a person\r\nconvicted of the same crime in a different court.</p>\r\n<p>The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986\r\nfollowed up by creating a framework of harsh mandatory minimum\r\nsentences determined by the type and quantity of drugs involved, and\r\nignoring other facts in the case, including mitigating circumstances.\r\n Conspiracy statutes are applied liberally, meaning those with\r\nminimal involvement could face serious charges. Some of the act's\r\nstipulations have been criticized as arbitrary, including setting the\r\n punishment for possession of crack cocaine at 100 times that of the\r\npowdered form.</p>\r\n<p>While both laws limited the sentences\r\njudges could hand out, neither eliminated discretion, which was\r\ntransferred to the prosecutors. Considering the federal government's\r\nnear-total conviction rate and the fact that sentences are determined\r\nwith significant precision by guidelines for each offense charged,\r\nfederal prosecutors essentially decide a person's fate when choosing\r\nwhich statute to apply, many judges and lawyers say.</p>\r\n<div id=\"container2\"><div class=\"highcharts-container\" id=\"container2\" style=\"position: relative;

The U.S. Sentencing Commission is insulated\r\nfrom political accountability, and can operate in the dark. \"The\r\ncommission can act without defending its decisions or its\r\ndecision-making process,\" the libertarian Cato Institute wrote\r\nin a policy analysis. \"The sentences for violent crimes were\r\nincreased, for instance, 'where the Commission was convinced that\r\nthey were inadequate'without any explanation as to what made a\r\npunishment 'inadequate' or how the commissioners became 'convinced.'\"</p>Defendants often feel powerless against\r\na faceless bureaucracy, but judges too complained that guidelines and\r\nminimums tied their hands, noting that circumstances of individual\r\ncases could be more complex and subjective than the criteria\r\nhard-coded in the guidelines.\r\n<p>Congress acknowledged shortcomings with\r\nmandatory minimums in 1994 by adding a \"safety valve,\"\r\nwhich allows judges to go below the minimum for certain first-time,\r\nnon-violent offenders.</p>\r\n<p><b>The Supreme Court intervenes</b><br></p><p>Ten years later in the landmark U.S.\r\nvs. Booker, binding guidelines were ruled unconstitutional,\r\nrelegating them to \"advisory\" status, in part because\r\njudges were instructed to take into account evidence that had not been proved in court\r\nbeyond a \"more likely than not\" standard. For example, a jury could quickly convict a person of distributing one\r\nounce of marijuana, then, at sentencing, prosecutors could reveal to\r\nthe judge--without proving it--that the amount of drugs found was\r\nactually 1,000 pounds. The sentencing guidelines required the judge to consider the additional\r\ninformation when sentencing the defendant, despite its\r\nnot having been introduced into evidence during the trial.</p>\r\n<p>After Booker, judges occasionally, but\r\nrarely, took the liberty of departing from the guidelines, and those\r\nwho did provided a basis for appeal. (The sentencing commission says\r\na \"sentence is unreasonable if the district judge fails to\r\nconsider the sentencing guidelines,\" and can be overturned.)</p>\r\n<p>Still, judges who went outside the\r\nguidelines almost always went downward, not up, indicating they\r\nbelieve the guideline sentences are too high. In 22,500 drug\r\ntrafficking cases in the year after the ruling, judges used leeway\r\ngranted by Booker to sentence below the guidelines 1,450 times, and\r\nonly three times invoked it to deliver harsher sentences than the\r\nguidelines allowed.</p>\r\n<p>Importantly, Booker did not do away\r\nwith mandatory minimums, and did nothing for those who had already\r\nbeen sentenced under the old interpretation.</p>\r\n<p>The husband of Gwen Bethea-Davis, a\r\n44-year old mother and recent college graduate in Atlanta (he did not\r\nwant to be named out of fear of causing problems in the prison) is\r\none such inmate, sentenced in 1988 to 30 years for possession of 63.5\r\ngrams of crack--a little more than a tennis ball weighs--as a career\r\noffender after pleading guilty out of fear that a trial and\r\nconviction would lead to life. The judge heard certain mitigating\r\ncircumstances--previous charges were incurred as a juvenile, his\r\nparents were uneducated, baffled by the legal system and chemical\r\ndependent--but was barred from taking them into account by the\r\nminimums, she said. If the judge had not been, \"I don't think he\r\nwould have gotten 30 years. He deserved time and accepts\r\nresponsibility, but the amount of time they gave him is ridiculous.\"</p>\r\n<p>Defense lawyers and their clients say\r\nthat the threat of extremely long sentences coerces defendants into\r\naccepting pleas, and that if the government believed crimes warranted\r\nthe sentences specified by guidelines, it would not reduce them to a\r\nfraction of that for cooperation. Roughly 96.3 percent of federal\r\ndefendants plead guilty; those convicted at trial receive a sentence\r\nof, on average, three times that of those who plead.</p>\r\n<p>Indeed, implicating others--providing\r\n\"substantial assistance\"--is nearly the only way for\r\nprosecutors to sanction a below-guideline sentence. Between October\r\n1, 2008 and September 30, 2009, sentences were lowered for 9,062\r\ndefendants who helped ensnare others, mostly in drug cases.</p>\r\n<p>Friends of Bethea-Davis's husband--many\r\nof whom were higher-level dealers than he, she alleges--have all gotten out because\r\ntheir sentences were drastically lowered for turning others in. It's\r\na further example of guidelines and minimums favoring consistency at\r\nthe expense of proportionality: Those most culpable can get sentences\r\nfar lower than those on the periphery by implicating their\r\nsubordinates, while low-level participants have no one else to turn\r\nin to save themselves.</p>\r\n<p><b>Could electronic databases help\r\ninform sentencing?</b></p>\r\n<p>After years of expansion, prison growth\r\nhas slowed slightly in the last few years--in part due to an\r\nincreased sensitivity to budgetary issues--and several bills to\r\nfurther reduce imprisonment have been introduced in the current\r\nCongress.</p>\r\n<p>In October 2009, Sen. Dick Durbin\r\n(D-Ill.) introduced a measure that would do away with the\r\npowder-versus-crack cocaine sentence disparity. The National Defense\r\nAuthorization Act instructed the U.S. Sentencing Commission to\r\nrevisit mandatory minimum sentences. A <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1475\">bill\r\nto restore parole</a>which would reduce\r\nincarceration rateshas gained little traction outside the\r\nCongressional Black Caucus.</p>\r\n<p>As for the problem of keeping judges\r\nappraised on common sentences for convicts in similar cases, there\r\ncould be a solution that wasn't available in 1984.</p>\r\n<p>The goals of sentencing guidelines\r\n\"include transparency, superior information gathering and\r\nanalysis, effective dialogue and clear goals and feedback.\"\r\nJudges report on an electronically-filed \"Statement of Reasons\"\r\nform, which the sentencing commission uses to compute annual\r\nstatistics, though when Booker freed judges to stray outside the\r\nguidelines for reasons other than those specified by the matrix, data\r\ncollection got more complicated.</p>\r\n<p>Even if judges are free to sentence\r\nindividual cases as they see fit, knowledge is power, and if they are\r\naware of what their colleagues are doing in similar cases, average\r\nsentences could ebb and flow as situations and societal attitudes\r\nchange, while allowing for informed consistency across the\r\ncountry--just as they look to precedent for legal understanding,\r\nwhile occasionally making precedent themselves.</p>\r\n<p>A record of sentences, and written\r\nreasons for them, comprising an \"institutional memory\" for\r\nthe judiciary is made possible by technology, but the idea is not\r\nnew. In Scotland, a law professor pointed out in 1999, \"the\r\njudge asks the database to display information about cases that\r\nresemble the case at hand in all relevant ways.</p>\r\n<p>But at the same time, perhaps the\r\nlessons learned by the failings of a sentencing matrix are precisely\r\nthat there are some issues too subjective to be completely quantified\r\nby data.</p>\r\n<p>\"We forget that the computer is\r\njust a tool. It is supposed to help, not substitute for thought. It\r\nis completely indifferent to compassion. It has no moral sense. It\r\nhas no sense of fairness. It can add up figures, but cant evaluate\r\nthe assumptions for which the figures stand,\" the Cato report\r\nsaid. \"There is no algorithm for human judgement.\"</p>\r\n<div id=\"container3\"><div class=\"highcharts-container\" id=\"container3\" style=\"position: relative;

disclosure: Sunlight has supported it financially) has gotten more than 100,000 comments from users of the site. To me, that seems like a stupendous total for a site that tracks legislation.<br><br>So what's drawn so much interest? It's not the House or Senate version of health care. It's not the cap and trade bill designed to marginally address climate change. It's not the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the $787 billion stimulus bill.<br><br>No, it's the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2009, which was passed and signed into law last November. The comments themselves are what's fascinating; here is a small sampling:<br><br><blockquote>Today, I used the few pay as you go cell minutes remaining on my only phone service to contact the Washington Office of the Representative for my zip code. Frantically, I stated my concerns having exhausted my long term benefits this past week. Essentially, as with too many others in this scenario  I too, will be another homeless mom in an ever increasingly desperate situation. I asked if their was any new info other than tracking HR 3404 that may provide a Band Aid as only Gainful Employment/JOBS can fix this crises. The male voice at the other end of the phone (Representative Daviss Office) stated that he didnt know that there was an Unemployment Benefit Issue!<br><br>IMO, all of the unemployment benefits extensions have been the only thing that has kept this country out of a deep depression. I hope congress comes to their senses and at least tacks on a Tier V. I don't think many of them realize that millions of the people who were laid off were in their 40's and 50's. Too young to collect SS and their pensions. Many lost most of their savings in the stock market crash. They're now trying to compete for jobs with the younger people who are also out of work. It's a terrible situation and a recipe for the perfect storm. We as a country are in deep doo doo when this all comes to a screeching halt. We all need to bombard our congressmen with calls\nand emails!<br><br>Congress is not set up to listen to the American people. They are set-up to play volley ball with each other. Your concerns are not their concerns. If you wanted a job, you should have ran for a congressional seat. Our president said that we are going to spend out way out of debt\nand I believe him. I got my job so you need to get yours.<br><br>When talking to other Chicago's unemployed they are also disgusted by the whole situation and tired of sending out resumes with no response coming. Since the Government isn't Houdini, these jobs are not mushrooming.<br><br>All States don't qualify for Tier Iv. Millions and Millions will fall off of the employment extension in March 2010. Just wanted to re-affirm that information so when the new unemployment rates comes out we're know why it appears that unemployment in this country is on the decline. NOT!<br><br>When is out help coming. This country can raise billions of dollar in a matter of days. But, the unemployed, have to wait for months before Congress and do anything. Whats wrong with that picture. Can't take care of your own middle class. But, can try and take care of someone else poor class.

Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) -- who was the beneficiary of a <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/party/16301/\">fundraiser</a> hosted by Dupart on September 30, 2009 -- noted that he'd secured $1,425,000 in funding for an interchange at Interstate 225 and Colfax Ave for the 2009 fiscal year. That's the same interchange that the <a href=\"http://www.auroraedc.com/AuroraEDC_AboutAuroraEDC.aspx\">Aurora Economic Development Council</a> (AEDC), a nonprofit public-private partnership made up of businesses and officials from the city of Aurora, <a href=\"http://www.auroraedc.com/AccelerateColorado_Transportation.aspx\">lists as a priority</a> for its federal lobbying. The Normandy Group, which has <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/client_reports.php?lname=Aurora+Economic+Development+Council&amp;year=2008\">represented</a> the AEDC since May 2008, sought \"federal funding for I-225 interchange\" for its client, according to lobbying disclosure reports.<br><img src=\"http://blog.politicalpartytime.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/P2110010-300x224.jpg\" class=\"leftImg\">The project was aimed at relieving additional traffic created by a project that the AEDC had pushed  a new health care complex called the Fitzsimons/Anschutz Medical campus.

Normandys lobbyists tracked highway spending in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the stimulus bill, and lobbied on funding for transportation projects in other appropriations bills for the developer, according to 2009 lobbying disclosure <a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=2E7C7921-F1FD-40C6-86BD-8F697B6A72AE\">reports</a>.<br>Several members of the Colorado delegation have sought funding for the I-225 project. In addition to Perlmutter, who <a href=\"http://perlmutter.house.gov/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=725\">included another request for funding</a>&nbsp;for the project in his fiscal year 2010 earmark requests, former Sen. Ken Salazar, now Interior Secretary, and former Sen. Wayne Allard <a href=\"http://earmarks.omb.gov/2009-earmarks/earmark_324557.html\">requested funding</a>&nbsp;for the project. Dupart hosted at least two fundraisers for Salazar, on <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/party/501/\">June 29, 2006</a>, and <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/party/1071/\">March 13, 2008</a>. In addition, the stimulus bill included <a href=\"http://www.ucdenver.edu/about/newsroom/messageboard/Pages/newinterchange.aspx\">funding</a> for early phases of the project.<br>In an undated <a href=\"http://www.ucdenver.edu/about/newsroom/messageboard/Pages/newinterchange.aspx\">press release</a>&nbsp;from the University of Colorado, which will operate several facilities at the new medical campus, Wendy Mitchell, president and CEO of the Aurora Economic Development Council, cited coordination between Colorados Congressional Delegation and the Anschutz/Fitzsimons Stakeholders Groupas making the funding a reality. In August 2009, the AEDC <a href=\"http://www.auroraedc.com/index.aspx?task=view&amp;option=content&amp;id=103\">honored</a>&nbsp;all the members of the Colorado congressional delegation with an A-List Leadership Award, presented by Colorado Governor Bill Ritter and President and CEO of the Aurora Economic Development Council Wendy Mitchell.<br><br>Overall, the AEDC has reported spending $60,000 for the Normandy Groups services since 2008, and Forest City Enterprises, $540,000, although the developers interests included projects across many states.<br>When asked for comment by the Sunlight Foundation, AEDC Vice President Bryan Blakely said the Normandy Group primarily helped by organizing meetings and that while the groups assistance was beneficial, they do not wholly attribute the success of the construction project to its efforts. <br><br>Dupart was scheduled to host a <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/party/18348/\">fundraiser</a>&nbsp;for\nColorado freshman Democrat Rep.

And didnt the President say that the number of new jobs was more than three times that latest figure? What gives Recovery.gov?<br><br>For those not willing to slog through blogs, press releases, or congressional reports, there is an explanation for this seemingly contradictory information.<br><br>According to a <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/01/30/new-reports-recovery-act-recipients\">White House blog post by Ed DeSeve</a>, the data available on Recovery.gov, including the number of jobs created, represents only a small pool of the money spent--specifically only $50 billion, or about one-fifth of the total amount of spending and tax cuts the the Recovery Act has pumped into the economy through the end of 2009.<br><br>DeSeve's blog post says the number of jobs created does not include Recovery Act spending on small business loans, tax credits and financial assistance for individuals and families. It also doesnt include indirect jobs that may be created as a result of Recovery funds, like jobs given to subcontractors of a government contract, or a waitress hired to handle a growing lunchtime rush due to a Recovery construction project being built nearby.<br><br>So when Obama announced that 2 million jobs were created, he didnt cite job figures from Recovery.gov, but instead used estimates calculated by the Presidents <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/100113-economic-impact-arra-second-quarterly-report.pdf\">Council of Economic Advisers</a>, which said the stimulus raised employment by anywhere from 1.5 million to 2 million jobs. He also used a report by the <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/106xx/doc10682/11-30-ARRA.pdf\">Congressional Budget Office</a> that estimated the number of jobs created as anywhere from 600,000 to 1.6 million.<br><br>The White Houses DeSeve said that Recovery.gov only tracks 20 percent of the Recovery dollars because Congress only asked that these reports be completed by a portion of Recovery recipients, particularly in infrastructure projects and education spending.<br><br><img src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1601498/Recoveryjobs2.jpg\" class=\"rightImg\">As for the total job numbers reported on Recovery.gov, the two tallies count different things over unequal lengths of time. The roughly 640,000 jobs that were reported over a period beginning February 17 and ending September 30, 2009, while the roughly 600,000 jobs currently on Recovery.gov cover a time period from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, 2009. The two numbers can't be combined to reach a total number of jobs created or funded by the stimulus, because some jobs would be double counted, said Ed Pound, spokesman for the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, which oversees Recovery.gov.<br><br>The same job could be counted in both time periods, Pound said. So for the most precise number of how many jobs have been created by Recovery money, its always the amount listed at any one time on the Recovery.gov site  that plus the other jobs created from the other 80 percent of Recovery money that the site does not capture.<br><br>The administration also <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/white-house-scraps-method-280295.html\">changed the criteria</a> for what constitutes a Recovery job. In the earlier period, only newly created jobs or existing jobs that would have been eliminated absent stimulus funds were supposed to be counted. For the later period, any job funded by stimulus dollars could be counted.<br><br>Further complicating the count was the question of hours: new jobs or retained jobs were expressed as full-time employees, but the period of the performance was not always explicitly stated.<br><br>A <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/documents/recipients_report.pdf\">GAO report</a> in November 2009 found that this data was being inconsistently reported and that there were differing interpretations of the rules on counting full-time employees. In California for example, two different colleges calculated full-time employees differently, one chose a 2-month period while the other chose a year period. GAO recommended that the White House clarify how to standardize the definition of measuring full-time employees.<br><br>Based on these recommendations, the White House adopted clearer language, telling recipients to calculate jobs created based on the employee hours paid for with Recovery funds during a single quarter. <a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/Transparency/RecipientReportedData/Pages/JobSummary.aspx\">Heres some of the fine print</a> from Recovery.gov:<br><br>...if three employees of a recipient worked on a Recovery-funded project for a total of 1,300 hours in a given quarter, and the recipient defines a full-time schedule as 520 hours per quarter (40 hours per week, for 13 weeks), the recipient would report that the full-time equivalent (FTE) of 2.5 jobs (1,300/520 = 2.5).<br><br>Of course, that type of fine print reporting only covers part of the $787 billion in spending and tax credits from the stimulus. When the new Recovery data was first reported late on Saturday, January 30, Vice President <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-vice-president-new-recovery-act-recipient-reports-posted-recoverygov\">Joe Biden issued a statement</a> that acknowledged that it only represented 20 percent of all Recovery funding.

Still other entries feature broken links or only contain a fraction of the information described on Data.gov. The Commerce Department says they're working on all of these problems, so hopefully we'll see an improvement in the coming days.<br><br>Consider the broadband applications database. The Recovery Act provided $7.2 billion in <a href=\"http://www.broadbandusa.gov/\">grants and loans</a> to extend broadband Internet access to underserved communities. The Commerce Department has released a <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/details/1321\">spreadsheet</a> of the applications they have received for those funds, including the names of the organizations, contact information and amounts requested. This is potentially useful information; one can easily see, for example, that a few states submitted a large portion of the applications--the top six submitted as many applications as the bottom forty.&nbsp; <br><br>However, the spreadsheet was already out of date when it was posted on Data.gov. The Commerce Department awarded four large grants before Jan. 21, 2010, the deadline for releasing high value datasets, but were not included in the spreadsheet. Furthermore, the data isn't new--it was released on September 9--although it is much more user-friendly in its current form to reporters who want to analyze the bulk data (previously, it was posted as a PDF).&nbsp; <br><br>What's more, the data has been searchable and up-to-date on the National Telecommunication and Information Administration Web site (<a href=\"http://www.ntia.doc.gov/broadbandgrants/applications/search.cfm\">here)</a> since last fall.While its helpful to researchers to have it in Excel form, it's not exactly new.<br><br>Another potentially useful database put out by Commerce is the National Technological Information Service <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/details/1560\">database</a>. The dataset lists the titles, categories, and sponsoring agencies of government-funded R&amp;D studies, and includes links that allow you to buy a copy of each report.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the description on data.gov is currently inaccurate; it says that the data is available electronically from 1964.&nbsp; The attached XML file only goes back to 2005, and for anything earlier than that, parts of it are only available through third-party paid services.&nbsp; <br><br>It would also be nice to have a clearer description of what some of the codes mean in the document.&nbsp; What's a category code 97P 97R 57K 57B?&nbsp; And the file is so large it required a programmer here at Sunlight to convert it into a form that a commonly-used program like Excel could handle--after crashing browsers on several computers all morning.<br><br>The third dataset available is a <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/details/1300\">list</a> of fees paid by holders of U.S. patents. Previously, you had to get a data expert to \"scrape\" the U.S. Patent Office site if you wanted to get your hands on this data--and it was popular enough that the Patent Office ended up putting out requests for users to stop doing this, because it was using up too much of their bandwidth. It's promising that this is now available to download -- but most of the <a href=\"https://eipweb.uspto.gov/2009/MaintFeeEvents/\">links</a> to the <a href=\"https://eipweb.uspto.gov/2009/MaintFeeEvents/MaintFeeEventsFileDocumentation.doc\">data</a> on data.gov were <a href=\"https://eipweb.uspto.gov/2009/MaintFeeEvents/\">broken</a> for the better part of a week, so users had to dig around on the Patent Office site to find out what the columns of numbers and letters mean.

But while we don't have a final analysis done, a few trends are becoming apparent. <br><br>The high value data sets consist, overwhelmingly, of information that's already been released elsewhere. In many cases, at least in the <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/ogd/raw\">raw data catalog</a>, the information is provided as, well, raw data. For example, the Dept. of Transportation released its <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/portal/site/safercar/menuitem.13dd5c887c7e1358fefe0a2f35a67789/?vgnextoid=9f4baa8c16e35110VgnVCM1000002fd17898RCRD\">Uniform Tire Quality Grading System</a>, which provides various ratings on the durability, traction and other qualities of tires. That information had long been available to consumers through <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/portal/site/safercar/menuitem.93c80a6a8792ea8fcc66941076ac8789/?vgnextoid=1d6c53feb18f6110VgnVCM1000002fd17898RCRD&amp;step=display&amp;brand=BFGoodrich\">structured Web pages</a>; thanks to the open government directive, it's now available in a new format: <a href=\"http://ogd.nhtsa.gov/UTQG/UTQG.xml\">XML</a>. With the raw data, and a good database program that can translate XML, a sophisticated user could load the data and start fooling around with it. (Of course, if one is a consumer looking to buy tires, the old original DoT site is probably a better place to go.)<br><br>It's not so much that we're seeing a lot of new data, but rather seeing it in new (raw) formats. That in itself can be tremendously useful--Web interfaces can never be designed to answer all the potential queries a user might have. Access to raw data solves this problem; it's one of the reasons that reporters frequently FOIA raw data sets from government. Give us everything, without mediation; we'll make sense of the data ourselves.<br><br>Alas, not everything in the release gives one this option. In the <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/ogd/tools\">tool catalog</a>, there is an entry for the <a href=\"http://www.epls.gov\">Excluded Party List System</a> database maintained by the Government Services Agency (Anu Narayanswamy recently critiqued it <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/epls/\">here</a>). The <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/details/1457\">entry</a> in Data.gov does not take one to the raw data, which consists of the names of individuals and entities banned from doing business with the federal government for various past bad acts, but rather directly to the clunky old Web site. <br><br>As a first step toward making agency data available in more accessible formats for sophisticated users, the open government directive is so far somewhat successful--plenty of data sets that had been available only as PDFs, or had to be pulled down by scraping Web sites, are now there for the taking (we'll have better counts of this later in the week). But new data sets are not predominant: the major agencies covered by the directive released 58 data sets, of which, by our count, 16 were previously unavailable in some format online. <br><br>We're still looking at the data, and will have more to report as the week goes on. <br>", "date_published": "2010-01-25 17:48:16", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "data-gov-opinion", "tags": "OGD, Open Government Directive, \"OGD\", \"Open govt directive\"", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 1976, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-25 17:27:29", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 1, "timestamp": "2010-01-25 16:27:47", "image": "", "title": "Ruling may free corporate influencers from contortions", "excerpt": "", "content": "The Supreme Court's <i>Citizens United vs. FEC</i> ruling undoes years of restrictions on the ability of corporations and labor unions to use their treasuries to attempt to sway elections.<br><br>But a more accurate interpretation might be that it allows them to be more up-front about it.<br><br>From the first days after President George W. Bush signed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, better known as McCain-Feingold, huge sums of unregulated money have flowed from multi-billion dollar businesses, powerful labor unions and wealthy individuals with the intent of advancing their agendas and swaying political opinion, often in hidden or convoluted ways. The act barred labor and business from donating \"soft money\" directly to political parties, but big donors found different means of influencing elections through Section 527 groups--named for the section of the tax code that sets up political organizations--and 501(c)4 tax-exempt organizations. <br><br>For a case study in more under-the-table influencing, consider the Koch family, which controls one of the largest, and privately-held, oil companies in the world. Koch Industries reported spending $20 million lobbying Congress in 2008--<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?showYear=2008&amp;indexType=s\">more than all but seven </a>organizations, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. <br><br>That sum pales, though, in comparison to the multiple channels through which the corporation and its owners, brothers Charles and David Koch, spread political opinions--through media, education and ostensibly \"grassroots\" political movements. While the company's K Street spending is easily determined, the public is often unaware of Koch Industries' extracurricular influencing.&nbsp; <br><br>Koch money established one of the premier libertarian think tanks, the Cato Institute; helps fund the Mercatus Center, based at George Mason University, which has sponsored <a href=\"http://www.legistorm.com/trip_browse_by_sponsor/index/sort/number/type/desc.html\">hundreds of trips for members of Congress</a> and their staffs; endowed journalism by conservative writers via the Phillips Foundation; and funded advocacy groups that have recently organized opposition to the health care reforms proposed by Democrats in Congress in favor of free market solutions. <br><br>How much the family and its company have given to various causes is not known; most of the groups they use to influence public policy--501(c)3 and 501(c)4 organizations--do not have to disclose the names of their donors. But the Kochs' ideological promotion goes well beyond what is normally thought of as political activity.<br><br>The Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation is helping shape academic programs at some top schools by providing endowments for conservative professors; at Pepperdine University's School of Public Policy, the money has been used to write a group of students $400 checks to study libertarian works such as <i>The Socialist Roots of Nazism</i>; <i>The Road to Serfdom, The Rhetoric and Reality of Distribution; Can Capitalism Survive?</i>; and Ayn Rand's <i>Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal</i>.&nbsp; <br><br>In 2007, the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation awarded grants to 23 colleges totaling $1.7 million, plus the Association of Private Enterprise Education, which encourages the study of market-based thought. The 501(c)(3) nonprofit held $190 million in assets that year, tax records show. <br><br>At the Clemson University School of Economics, which received $52,000, the funding is overseen by faculty members and used to award fellowships. \"They're free market people and we're free market people, more or less,\" said Raymond Sauer, department chair. \"But there's no strings attached to the money.\"<br><br>Koch family members founded the advocacy groups Citizens for a Sound Economy--now FreedomWorks, led by former House leader Dick Armey--and Americans for Prosperity. The groups, which derive much of their funding from oil profits, have been active in harnessing \"grassroots\" demonstrations among conservatives nationwide, and have worked to derail Democrats' efforts at environmental regulation. <br><br>In the early 2000s, Citizens for a Sound Economy built its membership roster--enabling it to present itself as a community-driven voice of the people, not a corporate mouthpiece--by selling insurance. Along with the coverage, purchasers unknowingly became members of the group.<br><br>\"Before I showed you this form today, did you even realize that you signed a form that was an application for membership in Citizens for a Sound Economy?\" a&nbsp; lawyer asked one woman during a 2004 deposition, the Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/22/AR2006072200683.html\">reported</a>.<br><br>\"I don't know what Citizens for a Sound Economy is,\" she responded.<br><br>Such think tanks and nonprofits--as well as business associations such as the Chamber of Commerce--can be used as a pass-through for corporate money.

As I continued to read I learned that my question probably can't be answered anyway because, as the<a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/countmiguser0506.doc\"> user guide states</a>, \"there are segments of the population that are not well represented by tax returns, most notably, the elderly and the poor.\" Because most of the people the hurricane drove out of Louisiana were poor, I figured attempting to answer this question using this data would be futile.&nbsp; <br>", "date_published": "2010-01-22 19:34:03", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "ogd-irs-migration-data-doesnt-capture-everyone", "tags": "OGD, \"open government directive\"", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 1973, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-22 19:29:38", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 1, "timestamp": "2010-01-22 19:28:40", "image": "", "title": "OGD: Housing and Urban Development", "excerpt": "<br>", "content": "How bad are the public housing projects where our nation's poorest live? A handful of tables from HUD released minutes ago may lend some insight. Here are some quick takeaways:<br><br>The first is quite a large <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/details/1329\">Excel table</a> detailing complaints lodged alleging discrimination based on factors such as race, disability, religion or retaliation for an earlier complaint, broken down by county where the housing project is located. Sunlight has made it slightly easier to <a href=\"http://tables.googlelabs.com/DataSource?dsrcid=119857\">access directly in your browser here</a>. <br><br>Some quick sums show that LA County tops the list for complaints of all sorts--whites and blacks alike say they're being discriminated against because of their race, as do those with disabilities. Of course, that's mostly because it's one of the largest counties: to make real use of this data to determine disproportional impropriety, we'd need to pull in housing project population by county. \n\nTarrant County, Texas takes home the (perceived) sexism award.<br><br>A more interesting measure, to me, is physical housing <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/details/1258\">inspection scores</a> (again, I've put in Google Fusion tables <a href=\"http://tables.googlelabs.com/DataSource?dsrcid=120217\">here</a>), which are provided down to the level of individual housing projects. It would be interesting to visit these buildings and witness cockroaches and holes in the walls--or see whether improvements were made in the wake of failing scores. Perhaps not surprisingly, the worst public housing projects in America are in New Orleans. Looking at average inspection scores per housing authority:<br><br>\n\n<b>Housing authorities with most run-down buildings</b><br>\n<table>\n<tbody><tr>\n<th bordercolor=\"#000000\"

The new datasets are:<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A list of <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/details/1492#\">90,000 state and local government recipients</a> of FEMAs Public Assistance Grant Program from 1998-2009. The program provides aid to disaster-hit public facilities or non-profit facilities. The file is easy to download in a CSV format and the data is pretty straight-forward. DHS says the public can use the data to compare local recovery efforts of public assets in their communities. Many of the recipients are whole counties, cities or states, so its hard to get real granular-level information on where projects are located. Having geographic codes would also have helped if someone wanted to map the recipients locations. The <a href=\"http://www.fema.gov/datasets/FEMAPublicAssistanceSubGrantee.metadata.xls\">technical documentation</a> for this dataset comes in a separate download.&nbsp; <br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A list of the more than <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/details/1491\">37,000 federally declared disasters</a>, emergencies and fire management declarations from 1953-2009, including the first-ever declared federal disaster, a tornado, that on May 2, 1953 ripped through an unknown county in the United States. Its unknown (blank, actually) because tracking of county-level data didnt begin until 1964. The last tracked disaster was storms and flooding related to the noreaster in Nassau County, NY that was on December 31, 2009. The data is in an excel format and is easy to use. DHS says that the data can help analyze patterns of emergency response activity at the local level which could help communities make budget decisions for emergency planning. We suspect the county-level information comes from Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes which the government uses to code locations. Perhaps the FEMA data manager assumed that the public wouldnt understand or care about having such codes. For the record, we care!&nbsp; Including those codes would have been very helpful in mapping or overlaying this data with other dataset such as migrations patterns. A note, the technical documentation for this dataset is pretty important to understand this document. Its available in a <a href=\"http://www.fema.gov/datasets/FEMADeclarations.metadata.xls\">separate download</a>. <br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A list of <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/details/1493\">18,000 projects</a> in the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program which gives funding to states and local governments to create long-term hazard mitigation measures following a disaster. This dataset is in an excel format and is quick to download, and the fields are pretty straight-forward, but the formatting within the document makes it pretty difficult to sort. CSV people, CSV! The technical documentation is also in a separate <a href=\"http://www.fema.gov/datasets/FEMAHazardMitigation.metadata.xls\">download</a> and is helpful for understanding what the share column means. DHS says this data can be used with other datasets to reveal recovery, preparedness and resiliency efforts within communities following a disaster. The data includes information from 1965 and 1966, then skips 23 years to 1989-2009. <br><br>All three FEMA databases were one-time releases, even though this is data that is continually tracked. We would hope that they decide to make these databases regular releases or at least update them. As of Friday night, the data is only available on data.gov.

A Sunlight Reporting Group review of the sites data finds that it continues to be badly maintained, with rampant problems including omissions, inaccuracies and other data quality issues. <br><br>The Government Accountability Office examined the <a href=\"https://www.epls.gov/\">Excluded Party List System</a>, which lists individuals and entities that are ineligible to receive federal contracts, some subcontracts and grants. The site allows procurement officers to check whether a potential contractor has been debarred, which can result from a contractor defrauding the government, evading taxes, committing a felony, or, in some cases, failing to repay a student loan. <br><br><a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/htext/d09174.html\">In a Feb. 26, 2009 report</a>, GAO cites several case studies which show flaws in the EPLS system, including agencies awarding funds to debarred contractors who have committed offenses ranging from tax fraud to violations of national security rules. While the report lists the month the company was debarred and the agency that debarred it, it does not list the name of the company. A search of EPLS&nbsp; for the dates and agencies in the examples cited by GAO, however, failed to find any plausible matches. And the GSA officials that manage the web site refused to talk to us about the specific cases of debarment or address the issue as to why these examples could not be found on the Web site. Our review included all the cases cited in the GAO report. <br><br>For example, GSA debarred a chemical company in May 2007 for affixing false manufacturing labels on products they sold to the government. The Drug Enforcement Agency later found that the company was selling chemicals to individuals for the production of illegal methamphetamines. Despite being banned from receiving federal contracts, the Department of Agriculture and the GSA awarded it another $1 million.<br><br>Asked why they continued giving contracts to the company, GSA officials claimed it wasnt the same company, according to the GAO report, which found that the company continued to receive contracts because its address was incorrectly entered in the database and it lacked any contractor identification number.<br><br>A review of EPLS data shows no debarments in the month of May 2007 by GSA.<br><br>Another case involved serious national security issues when the Army continued to employ a German company that was debarred after their president was caught trying to smuggle materials that could be used in making a nuclear bomb to North Korea. The report found that the Army continued to pay the company as much as $4 million in 2006 even though the contract should have been terminated based on past performance and the violation of national security.<br><br>Army officials claimed they were legally obligated to continue the contract, citing a rule that stated, agencies may continue contracts or subcontracts in existence at the time the contractor was debarred, suspended or proposed for debarment unless the agency head directs otherwise. The GAO noted that the rule allows the Army to continue a contract, but does not require doing so.<br><br>In July 2005, the Army debarred the company; as with the other case studies cited by GAO, there was no company in EPLS data that matched the description.<br><br>After several phone calls, interviews and email exchanges with GSA, their spokesperson, Jeffery Woodworth was unwilling to identify the companies cited in the GAO report or explain why our searches were not drawing them up on the Web site. The inadequacy of the search function was a problem identified by the GAO in its February 2009 report.<br><br>This has been a longstanding problem. A 2005 GAO report, which also found that several debarred contractors continued to receive contracts or grants, highlighted problems in how the data in managed and that several times contract officers dont search the database before giving out a contract.&nbsp;The report suggested that GSA strengthen&nbsp;EPLS search capabilities and take steps to update and maintain EPLS&nbsp;points of contact. In fact, the report says that when these deficiencies were pointed out the GSA simply&nbsp;restated its current policies and procedures instead of agreeing to&nbsp;take steps to oversee the completeness of EPLS and ensure that&nbsp;exclusions are properly enforced.<br><br>When asked about the GAO report, GSAs suspension and debarment officer Joe Neurauter officials dismissed the report saying the report doesnt matter because we double check everything and ensure the system runs properly and search engine friendly.<br>The number of individuals debarred compared to companies is much larger  a totally of 61,000 individuals and only 5,000 companies.

But what might surprise you is that he's based in Texas, and chances are good you've never heard of him.</p>\n<p>Democratic supporter Ben Barnes, who is from faraway Austin, Texas, has quietly and rather suddenly become the premier political financier in America. He appeared on the Center for Responsive Politics' list of <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/overview/topindivs.php\">top 100 donors</a> in 2006, ranking 87th, and shot up to 18th place the next cycle. Now, just two cycles after making the list, he is number one.</p>\n<p>In addition to his individual contributions,.according to the latest bundling disclosures with the Federal Election Commission, he's raised more money than big Washington names such as Tony Podesta: a total of $630,450 for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the first half of last year alone. That means he singlehandedly collected more than twice as much for the DCCC as all of the bundlers for its Republican counterpart, the <a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?_29992557353+0\">NRCC</a>, combined. <br></p>\n<p>With his wife, Barnes has personally donated more money at the federal level than <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/overview/topindivs.php\">any other person or couple this cycle,</a> at $233,000. <font>Federal election law limits the amount any individual can donate--$115,500 per \nperson for the 2010 cycle--so he and his wife have maxed out early.</font> Because the aggregate cap was lower in previous cycles, no one has  donated as much money in one election cycle as Barnes has in just nine months--at least since the 2002 campaign finance overhaul.</p>\n<p>In fact, his emergence as a poster boy for bundling is a direct result of that legislation, the crux of which was a cap on formerly unlimited donations from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals to party committees.  On October 11, 2002, just days before McCain-Feingold went into effect, Barnes wrote a $100,000 check to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, his last opportunity to give directly at that magnitude. Now, he and other heavy hitters must turn to other methods to move as much money as possible to their parties of choice--one of several unanticipated, indirect effects of the act that have emerged in recent years.</p>\n<p>The immediate fallout was a surge in spending by \"527\" groups, which crested after ideological groups--Swift Boat Veterans for Truth on the right and MoveOn.org on the left--exerted considerable influence in the next election cycle and were later fined by the Federal Election Commission. By the next election cycle, another side effect evident was the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2007/12/outsourcing-the-income.html\">emergence of a massive fundraising consultancy</a> industry, a result of the need for candidates who could no longer count on a steady stream of party funds to more aggressively target a wide range of individual contributors. Questions on political-related spending by corporations remain open as the Supreme Court considers <em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, </em>and in the meantime, 2010 may be the Year of the Bundler, with Barnes Man of the Year.</p>\n<p>Of the five DCCC bundlers listed in its October 20 report, Barnes is the only one based outside the Washington area, and his haul is more than ten times the $53,000 raised by the next highest bundler for the committee, Steve Elmendorf. (Some, like third-place Frederick Graefe, have lobbying firms  literally steps from the Capitol.)</p><p><b>Who is Ben Barnes?</b></p>\n<p>Barnes\nis far from a stranger among political circles, but he lacks the popular name\nrecognition afforded to others with his political influence.</p>\n\n<p>The\n71-year old's political rise came early; at age 26 he became the\nyoungest-ever speaker of Texas' House of Representatives, and later\nlieutenant governor and confidant of President Lyndon Johnson. His fall\ncame hard, on the periphery of a bribery scandal for which he blames\nRichard Nixon. After\nthe political careers of Barnes and governor John Connally stalled, the\nmen started a real estate venture, but when the Texas building boom of\nthe 1980s collapsed, the business followed and both men filed for\nbankruptcy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From\n1992 to 1997, Barnes lobbied for GTECH, a company that manages\nlotteries for many states, including Texas, and personally received\nfour percent of the firm's earnings from managing the Lone Star state's lottery, amounting to\nmillions per year. After a GTECH employee was convicted of\nreceiving kickbacks and the state lottery director launched an\ninvestigation into the company's political contributions, Barnes parted\nways with an undisclosed buyout.</p>\n<p>The state lottery director was then fired, and GTECH's contract unexpectedly extended.</p>\n<p>Barnes emerged on the national stage in the heat of the 2004\npresidential campaign, after the war record of Democratic\nnominee John Kerry came under criticism from Republicans, by claiming that he had helped George W. Bush avoid combat by\ngetting into the National Guard. Barnes served as vice chairman of\nKerry's campaign and bundled more than $100,000 for it.</p>\n\n<p>Now,\nBarnes' lobby shop, the Ben Barnes Group, has offices in Washington,\nAustin and Chicago. At the federal level, it employs five lobbyists and\nhas <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?lname=Ben+Barnes+Group&amp;year=2009\">taken in $2.8 million</a> in the first three quarters of 2009.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\" mce_style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">A\nconsummate networker, Barnes has interacted with some colorful\ncharacters outside of the political world. His firm was paid half a\nmillion dollars by R. Allen Stanford to\nlobby the government to allow Cuba to send a cricket team to a\ntournament he was hosting; Stanford was later indicted for allegedly running a fraudulent, multibillion dollar investment scheme. He's also represented Ruth Parasol, a former adult entertainment entrepreneur who became one of the richest Americans earlier this\ndecade as founder of PartyPoker.com, then lost much of her wealth in\n2006 after anti-gambling legislation passed by Congress forced the\ncompany to withdraw from the US.</p>\n<p\">Now,\nSunlight has found, the true-blue Democrat's lobbying shop is in an\nunlikely office-sharing arrangement with Washington defense attorney\nJames E. Sharp, who famously was retained by Republican President\nGeorge W.

On the other side of the aisle, he represented Daniel B. Brewster, a former Democratic senator\naccused of bribery.

To what extent did Barnes coordinate\nhis donations with those of his lobbying firm's clients?</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\" mce_style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">His\nindividual contributions are spread widely among state\ncommittees, and his national party bundling is directed, of course, to the House\nside. When it comes to candidates, however, he focuses with a marked\nsingularity on those in the upper chamber, from powerful Senate\nchairmen to challengers in competitive districts. Since 2003, the\nBarneses have written 118 checks totalling $205,000 to Senate\ncandidates' campaigns, compared with 11 checks totalling $20,000 to their\nHouse counterparts.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\" mce_style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">Individuals\naffiliated with Barnes' clients, largely big-name CEOs and their\nspouses, gave $213,000 to the DCCC so far this cycle--on track to\neasily surpass last year's total of $310,000--making up, at most, one-third of his bundled contributions.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\" mce_style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">Wayne\nand Dana Reaud of the plaintiff-oriented law firm Reaud, Morgan &amp;\nQuinn, for example, gave $60,000 to the DCCCpart of some $320,000 they've given to Democrats since 2007.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\" mce_style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">While\nBarnes is clearly a true-blue Democrat, many of the wealthy and\npowerful who readily cough up tens of thousands of dollars to bundlers\nwho ask do so more indiscriminately, or with motives more pragmatic\nthan partisan.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\" mce_style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">The\nHuntsman Corp.'s Jon and Karen Huntsman, for example, each gave maximum\ncontributions to the DSCCbut on the same day, they donated equal\namounts to its Republican counterpart.

John McCain's presidential bid; he's now ambassador to China.)</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\" mce_style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">James\nHudgins, another DSCC donor and vice president of oil giant Weatherford\nInternational, another Barnes client, has given nearly $100,000 in\nrecent years, largely to Republicans.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\" mce_style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">As for\nBarnes and other lobbyist-bundlers, the ever-adapting and seemingly unstoppable flow from those seeking to influence elections and lawmakers seems to indicate that despite&nbsp;the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act, big money will, like water in a leaky bucket, find a way to get to them.</p>", "date_published": "2010-01-06 13:52:42", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "Days before McCain-Feingold went into effect, Barnes wrote a $100,000 check to the DSCC, with a keen awareness that it would be his last opportunity to give directly at that magnitude.

Of those reviews that are made available on-line, the great majority were approved after 1997.<br><br>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Web site makes drug approval background documents available <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1mh37D\">online</a> only for drugs that were approved from 1998 on, according to spokesperson Sandy Walsh. Some information for drugs approved in 1997 or earlier is online, but only if someonea researcher, a physician, a citizen, a journalistmade a formal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for the information. Even then, in some cases the agency does not plan to post older information on-line because of the poor quality of some of the preserved documents.<br><br>That still leaves approval information on many popular drugs that treat common conditions behind closed doors. Researchers or consumers interested in obtaining this information must file Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and wait for weeks or months to receive the information. <br><br>It's unclear whether such information would be affected by the Obama Administration's new Open Government Directive, which asks agencies to identify and publish at least three high value datasets not yet available on-line at Data.gov and also develop an open government planessentially, a plan to release other public datain about six months. But proponents of more transparency in the pharmaceutical industry argue that such data should be a prime candidate for release. <br><br>\"Absolutely, they should be included,\" said Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, when asked if basic drug review information for older drugs should be on the FDA's list for inclusion under the new directive. At the time of this posting, a request for comment from the FDA had not been answered.<br><br>As of now, the FDA posts approval information on drugs online in an awkward PDF image format that makes it difficult for researchers or the public to use it. The reason for that, according to testimony by Dr. Erick H. Turner, who formerly worked as a drug reviewer for the agency, is that FDA staff typically receive the documents in an electronic format, print out the documents and physically redact certain information, then turn the documents back in to PDFs. The published PDFs are not hyper-linked or text searchable, and therefore are hard to navigate.<br><br>\"When a drug is approved and a review reaches the FOIA office, rather than redact it electronically, the staff apparently prints out a hard copy, redacts it \"manually\" using White-Out, then scans it in,\" wrote Turner. \"The result is a very long image PDF document in which all the textual information has been lost. The only way to find anything in such a document is the low-tech method of visually scanning each page.\"<br><br>In addition, posted documents often have sections that are redacted by agency reviewers, usually because such information is deemed proprietary. For example, information for one drug, the antibiotic Levaquin, included more than 58 pages that were blacked out by agency reviewers. There is no way to know why this information was removed.<br><br>The background documents, which analyze studies submitted by companies as part of the drug approval process, can be quite useful to researchers and the public. Doctors base their decisions on how to treat patients by reading the available medical literature, typically in peer-reviewed journals such as Journal of the American Medical Association and the New England Journal of Medicine. But drug companies lack incentive to publish negative information in such journals about their products, say experts.<br><br>The studies analyzed by the FDA, however, which are not necessarily published in these journals, can provide crucial insights for medical professionals. In a much noted study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers, including Dr. Turner, analyzed data contained in FDA documents for 12 popular antidepressantseight of which they had to obtain via FOIAand found that several commonly prescribed anti-depressants dont work as well as the literature published in major medical journals suggests. Indeed, of 71 FDA-registered studies the authors surveyed, 31 percent were never published, including 22 studies that showed results that the FDA had deemed negative or questionable.<br><br>Below are the top 25 prescribed drugs in the U.S. in 2008 (as reported on Drugs.com, a free privately-run Web site that provides drug information to consumers and health care professionals) with those for which

The Carson City Airport Authority has\nbenefited from millions in the past decade even though the city it\nserves, Nevadas state capital, is only 30 miles away from a much\nlarger airport in Reno that has regular commercial airline traffic.\nCarson Citys airport, which has no commercial traffic, has received\nmore than <a href=\"http://www.usaspending.gov/faads/faads.php?recip_id=96646&amp;cfda_program_num=20.106&amp;sortby=u&amp;detail=-1&amp;datype=T&amp;reptype=r&amp;database=faads&amp;fiscal_year=&amp;detail=-1&amp;datype=T&amp;submit=GO\" mce_href=\"http://www.usaspending.gov/faads/faads.php?recip_id=96646&amp;cfda_program_num=20.106&amp;sortby=u&amp;detail=-1&amp;datype=T&amp;reptype=r&amp;database=faads&amp;fiscal_year=&amp;detail=-1&amp;datype=T&amp;submit=GO\">$14 million</a> in federal grants since 2000, including $2.9 million in federal funds <a href=\"http://www.legistorm.com/earmarks.html?by=search&amp;member=&amp;member_state=&amp;less=&amp;more=&amp;organization=&amp;state=&amp;location=carson+city+&amp;description=&amp;year=all&amp;commit=Search\" mce_href=\"http://www.legistorm.com/earmarks.html?by=search&amp;member=&amp;member_state=&amp;less=&amp;more=&amp;organization=&amp;state=&amp;location=carson+city+&amp;description=&amp;year=all&amp;commit=Search\">earmarked</a> by Sen.

That was actually an improvement over 2008, when $363 billion out of a little less than $499 billion couldn't be placed in a state; 2007 wasn't much better.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>Will health care data be more timely and complete?\r</p><p>\r</p><p><input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\">\r</p><p>\r</p><p><input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"><input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\">", "date_published": "2009-10-26 14:33:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "how-data-dependent-is-health-care-reform", "tags": "Earmarks Lobbying", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 1917, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:25", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2009-10-23 19:02:12", "image": "", "title": "CAR Training - visualizations", "excerpt": "", "content": "Sign up for a many eyes account by clicking here: <a href=\"https://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/register\">Many Eyes Registration</a>. </p><p>\nGet the data to use by clicking <a href=\"http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AkEyoB__Z7dadEtzUTZqSlF2cjM4S2VFQjVlUFM2NEE&hl=en\">here</a>.</p><p>\nGet the text to use <a href=\"http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AUEyoB__Z7daZGd6eng1Ym1fMmhtbnFqeGZo&hl=en\">here</a>.</p><p>\n", "date_published": "2009-10-23 19:02:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "car-training-visualizations", "tags": "Earmarks", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 1903, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:25", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 1, "timestamp": "2009-10-23 18:54:12", "image": "", "title": "Entering digital age an expensive proposition for GOP", "excerpt": "", "content": "The Republican National Committee shelled out $1.4 million dollars over the last six months for Web sites and services, much of which was spent on GOP.com, the party's major Web presence that was unveiled this month, new Federal Election Commission expense reports show.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>The figure is far higher than what experts estimate it should have cost, and five times the amount its Democratic counterpart spent to host and maintain Democrats.org.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>The biggest disparity seems to be bandwidth costs--the RNC paid Smartech Corp., a Republican-focused hosting firm, more than a million dollars, plus $22,000 to Eloqua, compared to the DNC's $203,000 to Sprint, Switch and Data and Servint Corp.--despite the fact that the two sites' traffic, which determines bandwidth usage and, largely, hosting costs, was the same.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>But the design of the site itself was costly, too. In the months prior to the October 13 launch of GOP.com, the committee paid $328,000 to 11 firms for Web development. (The Democrats, which did not completely overhaul their site during that time period, spent $45,000 on Web development.)\r</p><p>\r</p><p>And when the GOP's graphics-laden product was unveiled, many of the main sections appeared missing or broken, including one advertised as listing future party leaders, which showed up blank.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>\"It feels as though too much focus has been placed on flashy features to the detriment of usability,\" said Jamie Newell of Washington-based 7AZ Web Design. The site's reliance on a mish-mash of technologies make it inaccessible to some, including those on mobile devices, he added, \"making it impossible to navigate the site and ultimately hindering the message they are trying to deliver.\"\r</p><p>\r</p><p>The text that fills the site, indeed, seemed almost an afterthought. The second-to-last item on the <a href=\"http://www.gop.com/index.php/learn/accomplishment/\">accomplishment page</a> ends in 2004, where one of the last items is \"Operation Iraqi Freedom.\"\r</p><p>\r</p><p>\"Considering the significant resources they invested, more focus should have been placed on the quality of the content,\" Newell said.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>For all the funds poured into GOP.com, not all of the features lasted more than a day. A blog by Michael Steele titled \"What Up?\"--whose first entry on the belated Web presence read,<a href=\"http://www.gop.com/index.php/chairman_steele/\"> \"The Internet has been around for a while, now\"-</a>-was abruptly renamed, having becoming the subject of mockery on the Web. Visitors to the home page were originally greeted by a miniature Steele making a video introduction, but that, too, was soon removed.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>The site features a plethora of technology-related buzzwords, but not always in their appropriate context. It touts itself as an \"open platform\" and solicits \"volunteer coders\" to contribute features to the Web site, but submitting a volunteer contact form yields no response.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>\"If they had anyone familiar with technology on the inside, they could have told them that much money wasn't necessary,\" a Democratic National Committee source who works with new media said. \"It's lots of money for a small return.\" And they seem to have created a Web presence not so much to advance specific policy goals, but for the sake of having one, he added. \"I can't see how this would build their long-term organizing efforts. They don't have a strategy for actually providing knowledge and creating value with this stuff.\"\r</p><p>\r</p><p>Smartech declined to provide details on its million-dollar bill. The RNC did not respond to repeated requests for information.\r</p><p>\r</p><p><strong>Party Committee Web Site spending, April-September 2009</strong>\r</p><p><table border=\"0\"><caption>Republican National Committee</caption>\r</p><p><tbody>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">SMARTECH CORPORATION</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$1,039,155</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Hosting</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">ELOQUA</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$22,500</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Hosting</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">BEP INC.</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$127,065</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Design</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">CD INC</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$84,165</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Design</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">QUIJOTE CORPORATION</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$72,989</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Design</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">NEW MEDIA COMMUNICATIONS, INC</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$13,500</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Design</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">3 NEXUS</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$7,000</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Design</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">ZURI GROUP, LLC</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$5,000</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Design</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">OUTLAW MEDIA, LLC</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$4,362</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Design</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">PC GROUP</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$4,159</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Design</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">JIM DYKE &amp; ASSOCIATES,INC</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$3,442</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Design</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">NETWORK SOLUTIONS</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$3,264</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Design</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">APP DEFENSE</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$2,625</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Design</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p></tbody></table>\r</p><p><table border=\"0\"><caption>Democratic National Committee</caption>\r</p><p><tbody>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">SPRINT</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$139,365</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Hosting</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">SWITCH AND DATA</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$43,673</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Hosting</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">SERVINT CORPORATION</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$14,250</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Hosting</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">FUSION NETWORK SYSTEMS, LLC</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$5,100</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Hosting</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">PAIR NETWORKS, INC.</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$1,131</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Hosting</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p><tr>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\" height=\"19\">THOUGHTWORKS</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"right\">$44,565</td>\r</p><p><td align=\"left\">Design</td>\r</p><p></tr>\r</p><p></tbody></table>\r</p><p><input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\">\r</p><p>\r</p><p><!--Session data-->\r</p><p>\r</p><p><input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\">", "date_published": "2009-10-23 18:54:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "entering-digital-age-an-expensive-proposition-for-gop", "tags": "Campaign Finance", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 1909, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:25", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2009-10-23 15:26:12", "image": "", "title": "Correction: Fees for Livingston Group corrected in FLIT", "excerpt": "<br>", "content": "Due to a data entry error, the Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker contained duplicate entries for fees paid to the Livingston Group by some its clients.

Some 244 members of Congress were the beneficiaries of these contribution clusters--totaling more than $9.4 million--from January 2007 to June 2009, an investigative collaboration of the Sunlight Foundation and the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org\">Center for Responsive Politics</a> has found. Telecom interests and their lobbyists engaged in more clustered giving than any industry save pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Overall, the top recipient of the largess was Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who took in $894,379 (many of those contributions were directed to his 2008 presidential campaign). The telecom interests also targeted House and Senate leaders: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., was next with $341,089, followed by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. ($275,275), Senate Finance Committee chair Max Baucus, D-Mont.

Verizon and AT&amp;T have been <a href=\"http://www.telegeography.com/cu/article.php?article_id=30617\">particularly active</a> in this effort; they also were the sources of all the clustered contributions among broadband providers, with AT&amp;T and its outside lobbyists combining to give to 110 members, followed by Comcast (105 members) and Verizon (96 members).<br><br>The analysis was based on a survey of giving by eight large broadband providers and two trade associations that represent them, all of which have disclosed lobbying on net neutrality issues. We looked for outside lobbyists of these interests who contributed to the same members of Congress as their clients had. For example, 55 lobbyists who reported AT&amp;T as a client collectively contributed <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">$170,800 to Sen. John McCain; AT&amp;T's employees, their family members, and its political action committee contributed </span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">$206,438 to McCain. The greater the number of such clusters coming from a particular interest, the more likely it is that that member is being targeted by the interest. </span><br><br>As noted &lt;a

So what does this number actually mean? What are they spending their money on?\r</p><p>\r</p><p>Part of it was spent on other lobbying firms. Outside lobbyists reported receiving $508,100 from the Chamber to lobby (that number should really be $510,000--one firm <a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=8ec6e2e7-542b-4433-b79b-9f03604f9e05\">didn't round</a> to the nearest $10,000) in the third quarter (slightly less than the $526,000 spent in the second quarter, when the Chamber reported spending a lusty but much lower total of $7,430,000).

I doubt they're being paid that much.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>The Chamber elects to report how much it spends on lobbying using section 162(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, which says that businesses can't deduct lobbying expenses and then defines what lobbying is. Here's the IRS' <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000162----000-.html\">definition</a> of lobbying:\r</p><p>\r</p><p><blockquote><strong>(A)</strong> influencing legislation,\r</p><p><strong>(B)</strong> participation in, or intervention in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office,\r</p><p><strong>(C)</strong> any attempt to influence the general public, or segments thereof, with respect to elections, legislative matters, or referendums, or\r</p><p><strong>(D)</strong> any direct communication with a covered executive branch official in an attempt to influence the official actions or positions of such official. </blockquote>\r</p><p>\r</p><p>It's letter C that likely explains the huge upsurge in spending: the Chamber <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125236911298191113.html#mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLTopStories\">has launched</a> a lot of <a href=\"http://blog.taragana.com/n/chamber-of-commerce-begins-national-ad-campaign-hitting-obama-plans-for-health-care-overhaul-137073/\">issues ads</a>; I'll call them tomorrow to make sure. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>How much they're spending on ads relative to lobbyists is anyone's guess--but should be disclosed.

The Obama administration last month agreed to dramatically scale down an Eastern European defense system that offended Russia and put a wary Poland on edge. The Bush plan would have used Poland as a potential launching point for missiles intercepting projectiles from Iran, but some viewed its ulterior target at Russia.<p></p><p>\nTalks between the US and Poland on a missile defense system took on an unexpected urgency when Russian tanks rolled in to Georgia in a territorial dispute last year. <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/client/Embassy%20of%20Poland/\">Polish lobbyists met 70 times</a> with the Administration and 38 times with House of Representatives and Senate staff between June and November to negotiate an arrangement under which the United States would install a missile defense system in Poland, ostensibly to deter threats from Iran, according to Department of Justice records analyzed by the Sunlight Foundation and ProPublica and available at <a href=\"http://www.ForeignLobbying.org\">ForeignLobbying.org</a>. Such diplomacy can be a zero-sum game, however: Russia claimed the system was aimed at it and declared that installation \"could not go unpunished,\" meaning that striking a deal with one Eastern European country would deal a blow to relations with its larger neighbor. In May, funding for the system was stripped by House Democrats who did not view Iran as an imminent threat.</p><p>\nThe negotiations played out against the backdrop of the US presidential campaign; while then-candidate Barack Obama criticized the defense system, the Polish foreign minister met with his opponent, Sen. John McCain, in September. Making as many as eight contacts in a day that month, Polish lobbyists communicated with key committees and members in the House and Senate and with then-deputy assistant secretary of defense for Europe and NATO policy Dan Fata, who left government to work for international lobby shop the Cohen Group (and has since publicly advocated for the missile base), and Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried, a former ambassador to Poland.</p><p>\nWith the reevaluation of the Eastern European defense systemwhich may be based off ships rather than mainland basesPoland can consider its $203,000 in lobbying fees a successful investment. Vice President Joe Biden travelled to Poland with a contingent of other former Soviet bloc countries, many of whose relationships with Russia remain icy.</p><p>\nPoland's lobbyists were also active during the same time period addressing a House resolution calling on its government to make \"immediate and just restitution of, or compensation for, property illegally confiscated during the last century by Nazi and Communist regimes.\"</p>", "date_published": "2009-10-21 20:28:12", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "FLIT", "slug": "scaled-down-missile-defense-system-comes-after-ramped-up-lobbyi", "tags": "", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 1859, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:25", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 3, "timestamp": "2009-10-20 20:39:12", "image": "", "title": "Recovery.gov recipient schema", "excerpt": "<br>", "content": "We've received a few calls from reporters asking where they can find a record layout for recipient data recently posted on recovery.gov.

Daniel Abraham.<p></p><p>\nThe Center for Middle East Peace &amp; Economic Cooperation appears to operate on a shoestring budget, relying on annual contributions of roughly a million dollars from Abraham and listing a payroll of four, two of whom reside in Israel, according to 2008 IRS filings. In 2007, the group listed four American staffers, each making $90,000 or less each, and two Israeli consultants, making up to $198,000 each.</p><p>   </p><p>Wexler will work out of its office in downtown DC, the center told Sunlight.</p><p>  </p><p><a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/CIDsummary.php?CID=N00002905&amp;year=2007\">Personal financial disclosure records</a> show that Wexler accumulated tens of thousands of dollars in debt while in Congress--a study of filings from 2007 placed him in worse financial shape than all but 10 members of Congress, according to a Center for Responsive Politics <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/overview.php?type=W&amp;year=2007&amp;filter=C&amp;sort=A\">analysis</a>. </p><p>\nWexler's finances have slipped slowly since he's been in office.  In 2008, his bank account held less than $15,000, and he reported credit card balances between $40,000 and $115,000 and college loans between $50,000 and $100,000. The Waxmans have three children. </p><p>\nIn 2007, he reported a credit card balance between $51,000 and $115,000, and student loans between $15,000 to $50,000.  The year prior, his credit card balance stood to $50,000 to $100,000, and in 2005, it was $25,000 to $65,000.</p><p>\nHis wife draws a salary from the American Jewish Committee and, beginning last year, income from Casi, the records show. Laurie Wexler does not appear in IRS documents listing highest-paid or \"key\" employees of the American Jewish Committee, which spent $180,000 lobbying Congress last year.</p><p>\nAs a member of Congress, Wexler was a hub for lobbyists working for other nations--far more so than any other member, including his colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee. He <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/legislator/Wexler%2C%20Robert/\">was contacted 173 times</a> in a recent year-long period analyzed by Sunlight, followed by Rep.

Dianne Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, Bernie Sanders, Rick Lugar, Pat Leahy, and John Cornyn also filed electronically last election cycle.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>Early this decade, as political action committees and House candidates were required to file electronically, Lugar's campaign found that not only were Senate candidates exempted from those mandates, but the Federal Election Commission actually prohibited them from availing themselves of the more efficient filing process.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>\"It would come up with an error message saying we couldn't do it because we were in the Senate,\" said spokesman Andy Fisher. \"You couldn't post contributions quickly with the FEC, so we had to digitize them on our own Web site,\" he added, to the great relief of a reporter who had taken to re-typing names from the paper documents for her newspaper. \"I think we saved her from carpel tunnel syndrome,\" Fisher joked. \"Finally the FEC set up an account for us, and we were the first ones.\"\r</p><p>\r</p><p>The program is not widely publicized, however, and some in the Senate campaign finance sphere said they were either unaware of its existence or simply had never thought to use it. In response to Sunlight Foundation questions, the office of Thad Cochran said it would begin e-filing.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>\"Cochran supports [S. 482] and is an original cosponsor, and now that it's been brought to our attention, there's been no reason we won't do it,\" spokesman Chris Gallegos said.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>But in a world where political considerations often compete with policy positions, most of the e-filing bill's sponsors have not availed themselves of the optional filing.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>\"We are reluctant to file by computer until there is a statute with which a possible opponent must also comply,\" said Chambliss communications director Bronwyn Lance Chester.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>All Senate candidates must disclose the same information, including contributors' names and itemized campaign expenditures. But donors then have to be manually transcribed, delaying disclosure, and expenditures remain confined to scanned images of paper documents, sometimes hundreds of pages long and useful only to those with a large amount of time on their hands--something few reporters have these days.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>Senators who file on paper don't face the same level of immediate scrutiny as presidential, House and the few Senate candidates who willingly disclose their records electronically. The e-records make it easy to quickly tally, for example, that in the last two years Cornyn's campaign has spent more than $9,000 at Johnny's Half Shell, a Capitol Hill restaurant popular for fundraisers, and $16,000 at Four Seasons hotels. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>Many failed challengers have voluntarily e-filed, and a couple of other senators appear to have flirted with the idea in years past, then abandoned it. Chuck Schumer filed reports in 2003; Sheldon Whitehouse did so in 2005. Schumer is a cosponsor of the bill, as are all those who filed electronically last year except Bernie Sanders.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>Some of the benefits of e-filing are negated by Senate rules that currently consider only paper reports to be official, meaning treasurers who disclose with the click of a button through a computer program also have to create a physical printout for delivery to the Senate, which then undergoes the same treatment as those of senators who didn't e-file, said Christian Hilland, a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>\"The Secretary of the Senate receives the paper reports and they scan them in, then transmit the images electronically to the FEC. We print them out here and send them to an outside vendor, who then enters the information in an electronic format,\" Hilland said.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>That means that by the time last-quarter donors are made public, the election has often long passed, the victor comfortably in office. The legislation stalled last Congressional session after John Roberts inserted what many considered a \"poison pill,\" but it is again on the Senate's calendar.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>\"There is no good reason why the Senate continues to lag behind House and Presidential campaigns, and political action committees, when it comes to filing campaign finance reports electronically,\" Feingold said in a statement to Sunlight.  \"My campaign files our reports electronically, as well as the mandatory paper report, and while e-filing is easier and faster than filing paper reports, most importantly it's a commonsense way to make our electoral system more transparent.\"\r</p><p>\r</p><p>(Download a Sunlight-compiled spreadsheet of available Senate expenditure records <a href=\"http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1210111/senateexpends-final.txt\">here</a>.)", "date_published": "2009-10-13 15:54:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "most-senate-supporters-of-electronic-fec-filing-still-disclose-", "tags": "", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 1756, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:25", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2009-10-07 18:30:12", "image": "", "title": "Follow the (Airport) Money", "excerpt": "<br>", "content": "Over the past five years, the Federal Aviation Administration has handed out nearly $18 billion in grants for almost 19,000 airport projects. In theory, these projects -- funded through the FAA's Airport Improvement Program -- are supposed to enhance safety or protect the environment. In fact, according to a <a href=\"http://www.subsidyscope.com\">Subsidyscope </a>analysis of FAA data (neatly assembled into a <a href=\"http://www.subsidyscope.com/projects/transportation/aip/search/\">searchable database </a>by Sunlight's Kaitlin Lee), a fair amount of money has gone toward the building of parking lots and other questionable things.\n<p></p><p>\n</p><p>We've only scratched the surface but have managed to extract a few interesting items from the database. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2005, for instance, airports in the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau have received an impressive $173 million through the <a href=\"http://www.faa.gov/airports/aip/overview/\">AIP</a>. The sovereign Pacific island nations became eligible for AIP money in 2003 after signing a Compact of Free Association with the United States. Under the compact, the U.S. agreed to provide financial assistance in exchange for the granting of defense rights.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Another $82 million went to Guam International Airport. Back on the mainland, Plattsburgh International Airport in upstate New York secured $26 million. Fat sums went to a number of obscure, general aviation airports, to the&nbsp;annoyance of&nbsp;commercial aviation types who'd like more grant money to go to the hubs that accommodate the airlines. The AIP, they argue, is fed to a great extent by taxes on passenger tickets and jet fuel, yet a disproportionate share of the money goes to non-commercial airports.\n</p><p>&nbsp;\n</p><p>Our database allows the public to find out what the FAA thought of projects at airports as big as O'Hare International in Chicago and as small as Beauregard Regional in DeRidder, La., before approving them. Through a Freedom of Information Act request, we obtained National Priority Ratings -- NPRs -- for every AIP project from Oct. 1, 2004 through Sept. 18, 2009. NPRs are assigned on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the highest priority. NPRs for the Guam projects ranged from a lowly 19 (for utility improvements) to a respectable 66 (for an updated master plan). The Plattsburgh projects earned scores ranging from 17 (for a parking lot) to&nbsp;93 (for a fire and rescue vehicle). And the projects in Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau got scores ranging from 19 (to modify a service road) to 90 (for fire and rescue equipment). The FAA's NPR threshold for discretionary grants (as opposed to formula-driven entitlement grants) is&nbsp;41; for stimulus grants, 62. In both cases, projects scoring well below those numbers got in on the AIP bounty. In an <a href=\"http://http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=/data/pdfdocs/Final_ARRA_Advisory_AIP_%283%29.pdf\">August report</a>, the Department of Transportation's inspector general took exception to the way the FAA had dispensed some stimulus funds.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>The database also can be searched by airport name and code, state and congressional district.

Because lobbyists have so many clients, often from different industries, the only way to logically classify their contributions was to list them simply as \"lobbyists.\"\r</p><p>\r</p><p>While that made it possible to track the total impact of their personal contributions, it also split the lobbyists from the clients they represent. Thus, a lobbyist for a big drug manufacturer would be counted under \"lobbyists,\" not \"healthcare.\"\r</p><p>\r</p><p>There had to be a better way to account for their real impact, and finally we came up with one. By combining the contribution databases with the lobbyist databases--records that simply didn't exist 20 years ago--we could finally begin to investigate the connections between the lobbyists and their clients to see if they were giving in concert.\r</p><p>\r</p><p><a href=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/images/blog/infographics/finance_committee/baucus_wheel.html\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/images/blog/infographics/finance_committee/baucus_wheel_promo.gif\" alt=\"Wheel of Health Care Fortune\"></a>\r</p><p>\r</p><p>To do it right, we first had to find all the lobbyists. Since the great majority of federally registered lobbyists live in and around Washington, we started by examining all campaign contributions from residents of DC, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, from January 2007--the start of the 2007-2008 election cycle--through the latest available data in the 2009-2010 election cycle.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>Then, with the help of a matching program developed by CRP, we examined each contribution by hand, weeding out donors with similar names, identifying spouses who also contributed, and finally linking the lobbyist donors with their clients from the lobbyist database. When that was complete, we then cast a wider net, checking whether any of the lobbyists we'd identified had also given contributions from outside the DC area.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>The final step was reviewing all PAC and individual contributions to each member of Congress since 2007 and finding every case where both the lobbyist and their client gave money to the same member of Congress during that two-and-a-half year period.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>That was when we discovered the size of the 'bundles'  something that had previously been invisible. We began the investigation by looking at organizations in the health and insurance industries, since healthcare is the number one issue on Capitol Hill at the moment, but the research we've now completed will enable us to expand to other industries as well.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>Don't assume for a minute that we've found a new golden bullet that fully explains the role of lobbyists in Washington. Giving direct contributions is only one of many ways that lobbyists win friends and influence people on Capitol Hill. Hosting fundraisers is another, as is advising clients on how best to spread their PAC contributions.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>But this research has given us a much more rounded view of the financial clout that lobbyists can bring to bear for their friends in the Capitol. After all, most lobbyists give only nominal amounts of money directly to members of Congress. The big money comes from their clients.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>Now, for the first time, we're poised to track it.\r</p><p>\r</p><p>Much credit for the timeliness of this project goes to the amazingly hard-working staff of the Center for Responsive Politics, who had to pull a full court press of their own over the past two weeks to get this information out the door.

The hedge funds buy defaulted debt for pennies on the dollar, then sue them later for the full amount owed in U.S. and European courts.\n<p>\n</p>Both in 2008 and earlier this year, members of Congress introduced bills to protect these debtor nations from lawsuits. The legislation was introduced after heavy lobbying campaigns by countries like the Republic of the Congo, which has spent millions of dollars hiring D.C.-based heavyweight lobbying firms.\n<p>\n</p><p>The hedge firms--like Kensington International Ltd. which fought a long drawn case with the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville)--claim that corrupt practices by rulers, and not the poverty of the countries, are the reason they are not able to repay their debts.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Kensington International, based in the Cayman Islands, is a subsidiary of Elliott Associates, a New York company. In the 1990s, Kensington bought up several debt packages worth $100 million from Congo, which led to a decade-long round of negotiations and legal battles spanning a few continents before the lawsuit was settled in 2007. But before that happened, Kensington International's sleuthing uncovered a series of hidden bank accounts, some belonging to the President's son, straw men and companies in tax-haven countries run by the head of the Congo's state-owned oil and gas company SNPC.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>While the court case was still underway, the Office of President Denis SassouNguesso of the Republic of the Congo hired lobbyists, according to filings under the Foreign Agents Registration Act maintained by the Department of Justice. In 2006, the <a href=\"http://www.fara.gov/docs/5733-Supplemental-Statement-20061011-1.pdf\">filings</a> show, SNPC paid Trout Casheries LLC, its U.S. lobbyists, the sum of $700,000 on behalf of the Republic of the Congo. The filing was the first time that the lobbying issues specifically related to debt management were listed; Trout Casheries also disclosed that they represented the President of the Republic  of Congo, Sassou-Nguesso, \"to respond to allegations of misconduct directed by creditors.\"\n</p><p>\n</p><p>According to the 2008 filings, the country spent $590,000 on lobbying alone and a total of $3.2 million to retain lawyers and for \"non-FARA related\" activities, including public relations campaigns and consultancy fees. They employed four lobbying firms, the <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/client/Office%20of%20the%20President%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Congo/\">Livingston Group</a>, <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/client/President%20Dennis%20Sassou-N%27guesso%2C%20President%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Congo/\">Trout Casheries LLC,Chlopak Leonard Schechter and Associates and the Loeffler Group</a>, that waged an intensive heavy lobbying campaign. Lobbyists from the firms met with members of Congress, their staff and executive branch officials about 1500 times--mostly to discuss vulture funds, according to data from <a href=\"http://www.foreignlobbying.org\">Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker</a>.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>People with close connections to President SassouNguesso, including his son, Denis Christel Saasou-Nguesso and close aide Denis Gokana who was then the head of SNPC, feature prominently in the legal dispute between the vultures and the Republic of the Congo. In addition to SNPC, Gokana headed two other companies, Sphynx Bermuda and Africa Oil and Gas.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Kensington's sleuthing uncovered that the SNPC, through its trading arm Cotrade, was selling Congolese oil to intermediaries; instead of direct trade, the off-shore companies headed by Gokana siphoned off millions of barrels of oil before delivering the rest to commercial markets in Europe and elsewhere.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Kensington argued that the diverted funds should be used to repay the country's creditors rather than enrich individuals close to the president. They sued various parties in U.S. federal court, including banking giants BNP Paribas for aiding Congo in diverting the oil revenues, using the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act, which was changed under the Patriot Act to give U.S.courts jurisdiction over international money laundering operations.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/556/en/congo_is_presidents_son_paying_for_designer_shoppi\">separate investigation</a> of Congo's oil industry by Global Witness, a U.K.-based non-profit, uncovered documents that furthered the investigation. They published credit card receipts in 2007 showing that Denis Cristel's personal shopping for designer wear in Dubai and Paris were paid for by accounts from another off-shore company, Long Beach. They also discovered that Long Beach had received payments from companies set up by Gokana.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>The report found that Sphynx and Africa Oil were both controlled by Gokana, and found that his role as a special counsel to the President while he controlled private companies was a conflict of interest, one that was prohibited under the statutes that created the state oil company, SNPC.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Although there is very little mention of these allegations of corruption in the U.S. media, European outlets <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article4138445.ece\">have covered</a> the story. At the end of a two-year court battle, Congo reached an out of court settlement with Kensington International an undisclosed amount.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Despite the revelations unearthed in Kensington International's suit, some in Congress continue to argue that impoverished nations are being short changed. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who serves on the who is on the Subcommittee on International Monetary Policy, has reintroduced the Stop Vulture Funds Act. She or her staffers <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/legislator/Waters%2C%20Maxine/\">met</a> with lobbyists for the Republic of the Congo about \"vulture\" funds at least 40 times in the one year period. A similar bill was sponsored in the Senate by Robert Casey, D-Pa., in 2008. Casey was never contacted by Congo's lobbyists.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>To counter the lobbying efforts by the Congo, Elliott Associates hired Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld to represent them in Washington, spending $570,000 in 2008 alone.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Waters' <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/googlesearch.xpd?cx=partner-pub-3418906291605762%3Assmjto-kmpt&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=vulture+funds&amp;sa=Search#865\">bill</a> would prohibit U.S. citizens from trying to profit from defaulted sovereign debt, and bar U.S. courts from acting on cases filed by sovereign debt \"profiteers.\"\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Waters' office has not returned phone calls or e-mails commenting on the issue.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\">\n</p><p>\n</p><p><input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"><input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\"></p>", "date_published": "2009-09-25 15:40:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "FLIT", "slug": "corruption-charges-prompt-congo-to-lobby-congress", "tags": "", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 1681, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:25", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2009-09-22 22:22:12", "image": "", "title": "Open Notebook: Health care", "excerpt": "", "content": "<b>Transparency-related provisions</b> in the summary of the <a href=\"http://finance.senate.gov/sitepages/leg/LEG%202009/091609%20Americas_Healthy_Future_Act.pdf\">chairman's mark</a> that Sen.

Intersecting interests have led them to join forces and lobby on a number of issues, including the characterization of distant historical events.\n</p><p>Turkey and the domestic advocacy groups that promote the interests of Turkish-Americans did so to protect the Turkey's image, while U.S. companies sought to bolster their own bottom lines. The efforts appear to have been successful for all the parties.\n</p><p>The Turkish government has consistently lavished millions each year on well-connected Washington lobbying firms--including those employing former House leaders--which contacted offices of the lower chamber 1,468 times, according to an analysis of data from <a href=\"http://www.foreignlobbying.org\">Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker</a> of disclosures filed in 2008 by firms under the Foreign Agent Registration Actnearly twice that of the second-highest country, Libya.\n</p><p>Turkey's efforts have now been augmented by a domestic effort launched by a Turkish-American entrepreneur. Yalcin Ayasli founded Hittite Microwave in 1985 as a one-man company with a grant from the U.S. Air Force, and built the electronics company into a firm worth $1.2 billion, with half of its products sold overseas, according to a company presentation. The company had $180 million in revenue in 2008, according to SEC filings.\n</p><p>Since 2004, Hittite Microwave has received roughly $30 million in contracts directly from the government--mostly to sponsor research and development--and has also done business with Lockheed Martin and other prime contractors, many of whom use Hittite electronics in their jets and other equipment, sold to both the U.S. military and Turkey.\n</p><p>In 2007, Ayasli transferred $30 million in stock to fund a new endeavor, the nonprofit Turkish Coalition of America. The organization is headquartered in a Washington suite that has also been listed as the address for the Turkish Coalition USA PAC, the lobbying firm of Lydia Borland (who has represented the Turkish government), and the law firm of Bruce Fein and Associates (Fein comprises half of the Turkish American Legal Defense Fund).\n</p><p>The family of Hittite founder Ayaslin contributed nearly half a million dollars to federal politics in 2007-2008, donating near the maximum amount to the House campaign committees for both parties, but largely neglecting the Senate.\n</p><p>TCA is headed by Lincoln McCurdy, who served as a U.S. diplomat in Istanbul from 1980 to 1984, and also functions as treasurer of the political action committee; he draws an additional retainer as Ayasli's \"personal advisor\" on \"political matters,\" in his own words. From 1989 to 2004, McCurdy led the American Turkish Council, a lobbying organization funded by membership dues from defense and energy companies with an interest in Turkey, and whose executive ranks include Borland.\n</p><p>In addition to the advocacy done through the ATC (which also funds trips to Turkey for congressional staff), a handful of its members--Citigroup, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, Chevron, Textron, United Technologies, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, which spent a combined $80 million lobbying Washington last yearlobbied Congress directly on the genocide resolution and other issues important to Turkey; the Aerospace Industries Association, a trade group, helped coordinate the effort.\n</p><p><strong>A matter of historical record</strong>\n</p><p>For Turkey and its allies, perception has been everything when it comes to the nearly century-old killings that left more than a million Armenians dead as the Ottoman Empire collapsed. The country has lobbied House and Senate and the executive branch to oppose congressional resolutions to label the incidents genocide, and funded academic programs that bolster the country's image and downplay the role of the government in the killings.\n</p><p>Those programs include the Institute for Turkish Studies at Georgetown University, which received an initial $3 million disbursement from Turkey in 1982 and continues to draw annual financial support from the government, and is chaired by Nabi Sensoy, Turkey's ambassador to the United States. In 2006, a board member, Donald Quataert, resigned from the institute, claiming that after he acknowledged in an academic review that the Armenian killings met the definition of genocide, Sensoy told him Turkish authorities had threatened to revoke the Institute's  funding. Sensoy disputed the allegations.\n</p><p>The Turkish American Legal Defense Fund, financed by TCA, aggressively pursues those who threaten the country's reputation, including suing the Southern Poverty Law Center and David Holthouse, a journalist who prepared a report for the nonprofit, for upwards of $8 million on behalf of an academic. In that case, the Foreign Agents Registration Act is at issue. Holthouse suggested that, as part of a group of professors who have enjoyed endowed positions at universities financed directly by the government of Turkey and who have expressed views on the killings outside of the academic mainstream, he was acting as a foreign agent. If true, the academic would be required to file detailed disclosures with the U.S. Justice Department.\n</p><p><strong>Courting Ankara</strong>\n</p><p>Since the beginning of the war in Iraq in 2003, the U.S. government has been especially wary of riling Turkey, which shares a border with the war-torn country. Despite widespread support for the resolution labeling the Armenian killings genocide, lawmakers have consistently kept it from a floor voteeven in 2007, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed her preference for a vote.\n</p><p>Few members have been as vocal as opposing the resolution as Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who sits on the House Foreign Affairs committee and is a top recipient of Turkish Coalition USA PAC money.\n</p><p>More quietly, U.S. companies with interests in Turkey have lobbied on the resolution. For U.S. defense contractors, the Turkish armed forces are a multi-billion dollar market--Lockheed Martin and Raytheon would benefit from to latest proposed missile sale. Chevron is constructing a pipeline that passes through Turkey. CitiGroup, which has funded development projects in Turkey since 1975, acquired a twenty percent stake in the country's largest private bank in 2006, and acquired an investment brokerage in 2007.\n</p><p>By itself, Turkey boasts a formidable army of Washington lobbyists. The government has employed the Livingston Group, which boasts Bob Livingston, who'd served as chair of the House Appropriations Committee in the 1990s; Dickstein Shapiro LLP, which has former House Speaker Dennis Hastert on its payroll; DLA Piper, which employed former House majority leader Dick Armey, and the Gephardt Group, led by former House minority leader and Democratic presidential candidate Richard Gephardt. With the addition of corporate interests and its network of domestic supporters, it has built a formidable influence operation--one that can prevent legislation from coming to a vote.</p>\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://www.mindmeister.com/maps/public_map_shell/29448428?width=600&amp;height=400&amp;zoom=1\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"overflow:hidden\"></iframe>", "date_published": "2009-09-17 14:13:12", "is_favorite": true, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "FLIT", "slug": "defense-contractors-join-turkish-lobbying-effort-in-pursuit-of-", "tags": "", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 1658, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:26", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 1, "timestamp": "2009-09-10 22:28:12", "image": "", "title": "Turkey's influence over lawmakers surfaces in Ohio hearing", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p>Labeling the killing of 1.5 million\nArmenians between 1915 and 1923, many at the hands of Ottoman\ngovernment, an act of genocide has been a controversial issue in\nTurkey, among some historians, in the U.S. Congress, and now in the\nunlikely venue of the Ohio Board of Elections, where recent hearings\nindirectly considered the government of Turkeys connection, if any, to\nTurkish advocacy groups in Washington.</p>\n<p>Backed by lawyers from the Turkish American Legal Defense Fund, Rep. <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00027526&amp;type=I\" target=\"_blank\">Jean Schmidt</a>,\nR-Ohio, filed a false claims complaint against David Krikorian, who ran\nagainst her in 2008 as an independent and garnered 18 percent of the\nvote. Schmidts complaint stems from campaign literature in which\nKrikorian claimed she has taken $30,000 in blood money from Turkish\nsponsored political action committees to deny the slaughter of 1.5\nmillion Armenian men, women and children by the Ottoman Turkish\ngovernment during World War I.</p>\n<p>Though Jean Schmidt doesnt sit on the subcommittee responsible for\nthe Armenian Genocide legislation, its clear that shes a favorite of\nthe Turkish community. With $18,450 in contributions from three\nTurkish-focused PACs since 2007, the second-term House member has\nreceived far more than even influential senior members, and nearly\ntwice as much as the second-highest recipient, Virginia Foxx, whose\nson-in-law is Turkish. A list of fundraisers compiled by the Turkish\nCoalition USA PAC shows that the group held several events for Schmidt,\nraising thousands more. And four individuals who gave to Turkish PACs\nalso donated a combined $8,700 directly to Schmidts campaign.</p>\n<p>At issue before the Ohio Board of Elections is whether Krikorians\nlanguage holds upwhether it was accurate to describe three\nTurkey-focused political action committees as Turkish sponsored. The\nfalse claims complaint against Krikorian comes after the board censured\nSchmidt for a reckless disregard for truth in her own campaign\nliterature.</p>\n<p>Lobbyists for the government of Turkey, including former congressmen Bob Livingston, made more than <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/client/Embassy%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Turkey\">2,260</a> <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/client/Government%20of%20Turkey\">contacts</a>\nwith officials in an unparalleled push to quash a resolution in\nCongress that would deem the events genocide.

She said she\nhad never heard of the Armenian massacres until Krikorianwho is of\nArmenian heritageraised the issue, and that she still hasnt decided\nhow she would vote on a resolution that would condemn the act as\ngenocide, should it reach the House floor.</p>\n<p>But materials put out by the Turkish Coalition of America and\nauthored by a lawyer, Bruce Fein, who now represents Schmidt in the\ncomplaint, say that Congresswoman Schmidt has on numerous occasions\nvoiced her opposition to such resolutions and maintains that the\nhistorical question is not appropriate for Congress to legislate. The\ncongresswoman, based on her independent research, does not believe the\ntragic events constitute genocide.</p>\n<p>Schmidt acknowledged reading a book on the killings by Guenter Lewy,\na college professor, which figures in a controversy of its own. The\nSouthern Poverty Law Center claimed that the government of Turkey paid\nLewy to pen the book, The Armenian Massacres in Ottoman Turkey: A\nDisputed Genocide, in a manner favorable to the country. In December,\nLewy, represented by two lawyers from the Turkish American Defense Fund\nwho also hold positions at the Turkish Coalition of AmericaBruce Fein\nand David Saltzmansued the Southern Poverty Law Center and the\nreports author, on the grounds that the article claimed that Lewy was\nan unregistered foreign agent, which he says is false. The government\nof Turkey has funded academic programs, including the Institute for\nTurkish Studies at Georgetown University, and endowed professorships.</p>\n<p>As Krikorians counsel questioned Schmidt about whether the PACs\nwere indeed sponsored by the state of Turkey, he repeatedly tried to\nnail down Schmidts view of the 1915 events. Schmidt sought some\nwiggle-room by saying that genocides were, by definition,\nstate-sponsored, and that no trial or tribunal had concluded that the\nmassacre was directly linked to the government at the time.</p>\n<p>In June, while President Barack Obama visited Turkey, an essay\nappeared in a Turkish newspaper under Schmidts byline opining that the\nUnited States should not investigate the killings. What happened in\n1915 must never be forgotten, the article said, but in her deposition,\nSchmidt was squishy about just what happened.</p>\n<p>A fundraising e-mail from a Turkish PAC says she is willing to\nstand up to the Armenian lobby, and it is important for the Turkish\ncommunity to support her. But Schmidt, who says her campaign was run\nby her husband, her chief of staff and interns, claimed to have no role\nin setting up the fundraisers, no inkling of why Turkish donors had\nbecome a surprising part of her fundraising base and no recollection of\nmeeting top donors, including one who chauffeured her around Turkey.\n(In May, Schmidt took a $10,000 trip to Turkey, sponsored by the\nTurkish Coalition of America.)</p>\n<p>Its not the first time Schmidt has declined to take a clear\nposition or found herself making statements contradicted by her record.\nThis week, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YshG_Ok8idc&amp;fmt=18\">video surfaced</a>\nof her telling a woman who claimed that Obama may not have been born in\nthe United States that she agrees with her, despite having previously\nissued a statement saying he is indeed a citizen of this country.</p>\n<p>Schmidt expressed little familiarity with the workings of her\ncampaign as well as the complex ties between Turkish groups, including\nthe Turkish American Legal Defense Fund, whose lawyers, she says, are\nbeing paid in campaign funds.

Health and Human Services Secretary, Richard Schweiker, submitted a plan in December 1982 based on administration proposals. Draft legislation was quickly appended to the fast-moving and, highly publicized Social Security Amendments of 1983. Few legislators became actively involved, some commentators feel, because attempts to limit funding rarely become popular issues. As a result, provisions of the legislation were largely designed behind the scenes by legislative aides. The Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health finalized and wrote up the bill in one day, February 24. In April, only four months after initial appearance of a PPS [Prospective Payment System] plan, the Social Security Amendments Act of 1983 (Public Law 98-21) was signed into law, with Title VI containing the new Medicare payment system.</blockquote><p></p><p>\nThe 1983 act changed Medicare reimbursements from a fee-for-service model to a prospective payment system. The former is pretty much what it sounds like: a hospital charges $30,000 for a hip replacement, and Medicare reimburses it $30,000. In the latter, Medicare devises a schedule -- $15,000 is a fair price for hip replacements -- and hospitals more or less have to like it or lump it (there were exceptions carved out for teaching hospitals, sole community hospitals and other institutions).</p>", "date_published": "2009-09-08 20:50:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "slug", "tags": "", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 1650, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:26", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 4, "timestamp": "2009-09-08 20:35:12", "image": "", "title": "ClinicalTrials.gov missing basic data", "excerpt": "", "content": "Fewer than half of medical clinical trials published in the last year in leading medical journals are reported on the government site <a href=\"clinicaltrials.gov\">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, according to a <a href=\"http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/302/9/977?home\">new study</a> published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).</p><p>\nAccording to the study, despite a 2005 requirement by medical journal editors that researchers register their studies online before acceptance in a major journal, just 147 out of 323 articles published in the past year were properly registered before the end of the trial.

Tax havens offer secrecy, so even if the government knows how much money they hold (I doubt that it does) it can't determine who owns it. Plus, as Andy Quinlan of the <a href=\"http://freedomandprosperity.org/\">Center for Freedom and Prosperity</a> pointed out, lots of the numbers on tax havens <a href=\"http://www.freedomandprosperity.org/Papers/blum-crs-ltr.pdf\">are squishy</a>, as the linked Congressional Research Service document shows (it's short--just one page--with no higher math! It also says a lot about the uncertainties of estimating revenues from offshore tax revenues).</p><p>\n<b>The <i>real</i> money in politics</b>: Whether we're talking about extending health benefits to the uninsured, cap and trade, or the <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/105xx/doc10521/2009BudgetUpdate_Summary.pdf\">deficit spending</a> in general, tax revenue (or lack thereof) forms a major part of the discussion (as it does in the long range problems forecast for Medicare and Social Security). There are <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/07/10/house.health.care.tax/index.html\">exceptions</a>, obviously, but not many politicians seem interested in talking about additional taxes to pay for new spending. </p><p>\n<strong>Obama's tax proposals</strong>: The administration's <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/LEVELING-THE-PLAYING-FIELD-CURBING-TAX-HAVENS-AND-REMOVING-TAX-INCENTIVES-FOR-SHIFTING-JOBS-OVERSEAS/\">reforms</a> seem to be mostly directed at U.S. corporations and individuals, and not necessarily at tax havens (there is a provision that would require <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/businesses/international/article/0,,id=102314,00.html\">Qualified Intermediaries</a> -- foreign institutions or foreign branches of U.S. institutions -- to \"share as much information about their U.S. customers as U.S. financial institutions do\").

Ted Bravakis, the public affairs officer for the Cayman Islands Ministry of Financial Services, offered some confirmation for that theory: \"The Cayman Islands, as a UK Overseas Territory, approaches international relations similar to a private sector organisation.  This means we take a very 'hands on' approach -- rather than relying on a diplomatic corps which is not afforded to us -- to build and reinforce relationships with foreign countries.

Sharman, recounts that effort, what was behind it, and why it failed. Sharman did a lot of field work, and comes to some interesting conclusions, among them: that corporations that benefit from the use of offshore tax havens were not at all involved in the effort against the OECD, either domestically (the U.S. pulled out of the effort in 2001) or internationally (he contrasts the lack of corporate involvement in the tax haven issue to robust corporate involvement in OECD efforts to regulate e-commerce). </p><p>\n<b>The power of blacklisting</b>: Sharman argues that the main power of the OECD initiative was its ability to label tax havens as bad actors, making them potentially less attractive destinations for capital: \"...once jurisdictions were blacklisted, their reputations were changed. They were left vulnerable to capital flight because third party investors were more likely to either avoid or withdraw from listed states.\" <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/issue_search/?query=blacklist\">Blacklist</a> turns up in the Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker as an issue of concern.</p><p>\n<b>Inconsistencies</b>: Sharman also points out many internal problems with the OECD initiative--not the least of which was omitting from its list of harmful tax competitors Switzerland and Luxembourg, both of which are OECD members. Rich tax havens in Europe were let off the hook, while poorer tax havens in the Caribbean, Central America, the South Pacific and Africa were blacklisted. </p><p>\n<b>The role of ideology</b>: Sharman mainly credits the <a href=\"http://freedomandprosperity.org/\">Center for Freedom and Prosperity</a> for turning back the OECD effort, with an assist from the havens themselves (although it's also worth noting that there was no unified response from tax havens: The Cayman Islands very quickly got on board with OECD effort, for example, while Barbados held out--despite its financial services industry's preference for cooperation with the OECD). Andrew Quinlan, Dan Mitchell and Veronique de Rugy played the pivotal role in redefining the argument from \"harmful tax competition\" to \"global tax regulation,\" arguing that the OECD was attempting to impose some of its members' preferences for high taxes on the rest of the world. Sovereignty became the issue, rather than the OECD's preferred narrative of a harmful \"rush to the bottom\" caused by tax competition. One thing Sharman doesn't get into enough--Quinlan, Mitchell and de Rugy had much easier going with a Republican Congress and the Bush administration. </p><p>\n<b>Current scene</b>: With a Democratic Congress and the Obama administration, it would seem that tax havens might have less room to maneuver, and the Center for Freedom and Prosperity--which is lobbying on several fronts, and having multiple meetings on the Hill with members to oppose the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act--would find less sympathetic ears. Quinlan told me that \"there's not much of a lobbying effort by the countries themselves,\" and that, in the current climate havens \"are willing to go along to get along and do whatever they can to survive.\" I have to admit, I was skeptical when Quinlan told me that \"it's not like the British Virgin Islands or Antigua can afford to pay a $50,000 a month retainer to a Washington representative,\" since we were seeing payments higher than that from some (but not all) tax havens, but now I see, via <a href=\"http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/84503/\">InstaPundit</a>, that the Cayman Islands <a href=\"http://caymannetnews.com/breaknews-18000--1-1---.html\">have their own budget crisis</a>.

At the time, Tsvangirai spoke with Ben-Menashe about a plan to \"eliminate\" Mugabe. Ben-Menashe turned over a videotape of the conversation to Mugabe's administration, and Tsvangirai was charged with treason.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Tsvangiria claimed he was approached by Ben-Menashe, but in an interview, the Montreal-based lobbyist said it was the other way around. \"The head of the opposition of the government you're representing says, 'Can you help us do a coup and kill the guy?'\"\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Tsvangiria was acquited in 2004 when it became clear that he may have been asking for Ben-Menashe's help as a political consultant--not an assassin--and after Ben-Menashe made an impression on the court as an unreliable witness trying to manipulate politicians' public images.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>In a statement, Tsvangiria said the two met four times. \"At the fourth meeting, Mr. Menashe kept on deviating from the issues discussed previously.

Those lobbyists had at least 222 contacts with members of Congress, their staff and executive branch officials in which they discussed tax laws, legislation aimed at tax havens like the <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s681/show\">Stop Tax Haven Abuse</a> bill, or efforts to negotiate tax exchange information agreements with the United States and other countries, a review of data in <a href=\"http://www.foreignlobbying.org\">Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker</a> (online at <a href=\"http://www.foreignlobbying.org\">www.foreignlobbying.org</a>) shows. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>Signing or even committing to sign such agreements earns tax havens a stamp of approval from the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, an international body of developed countries that promotes policies that will spur development elsewhere.

As the Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker <a href=\"http://foreignlobbying.org/client/Cayman%20Islands%20Government%2C%20Portfolio%20of%20Finance%20and%20Economics/\">shows</a>, they also touted Cayman Islands participation in trade information exchange agreements, its OECD status, and its efforts at transparency.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Fleishman-Hillard also prepped their client for a March 2008 visit from the Government Accountability Office (the findings from that visit are in this <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08778.pdf\">report</a> that noted praise for the Caymans' legal system and \"strong culture of compliance\" but also noted that the jurisdiction's bank secrecy created problems for U.S. investigative and enforcement efforts. The report also noted that partners of Maples and Calder said that U.S. taxpayers bear ultimate responsibility for compliance with U.S. tax laws.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Fleishman-Hillard offered advice to the Caymans government on how to respond to a <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E5DF1038F932A25750C0A96E9C8B63\">critical letter to the editor</a> in the New York Times by Robert Morgenthau, then the district attorney of the county of New York and introduced government officials to U.S. financial industry trade groups to search for common lobbying interests.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>But the disclosures also show that Ugland House kept rearing its head. As early as December 2007, Fleishman-Hillard lobbyists sent information to an aide in Obama's Senate office about the building and its occupant.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>In January 2008, when Obama repeated the line about Ugland House in a presidential campaign forum in Manchester, N.H., Fleishman-Hillard lobbyists forwarded the transcript to their client. Two days later, Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, also disparaged the Caymans at a Republican presidential event. He said that tax cheats \"can hide [income] away in a Cayman Island offshore bank account and pay no tax on it.\" Two weeks later, Fleishman-Hillard forwarded all the presidential candidates information on the Caymans.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.fara.gov/docs/5801-Supplemental-Statement-20090619-4.pdf\">filing</a> from 2009, not yet in Foreign Influence Lobbying Tracker, shows that representatives of Fleishman-Hillard approached members of the Obama campaign after a pre-election rally in November, to advise them on \"facts concerning Ugland House and Cayman Islands financial services.\"\n</p><p>\n</p><p>When Obama repeated his stump speech line, he set off a small protest from interests in the Cayman Islands. Anthony Travers, chairman of the Cayman Islands Financial Services Association <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS226631+05-May-2009+PRN20090505\">responded</a> with an open letter, disputing the notion that foreign businesses operating in his jurisdiction are doing anything illegal.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>And the <em>Spectator</em> <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/business/coffeehouse/3615463/the-tax-havens-fight-back.thtml\">reported</a> that someone from the Caymans had sent out a press release noting that the in Vice President Joe Biden's home state of Delaware is a building that has, not 12,000 companies, but 217,000 claiming it as an address.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Bravakis said the government hadn't sent the press release. Whoever did could have found the comparison of Ugland House to the Wilmington, Del., firm in filings made by Fleishman-Hillard.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"> <input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\">\n</p><p>\n</p><p><input id=\"gwProxy\" type=\"hidden\"><input id=\"jsProxy\" onclick=\"jsCall();\" type=\"hidden\"></p>", "date_published": "2009-08-20 22:37:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "FLIT", "slug": "raising-their-ugland-house-cayman-islands-lobbies-to-keep-haven", "tags": "", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 1489, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:26", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 3, "timestamp": "2009-08-18 19:51:12", "image": "", "title": "Opening the Window on Foreign Lobbying", "excerpt": "<br>", "content": "In 2008, Bermuda's influential reinsurance industry needed some help.

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,\ncharged that the deal would compromise U.S. port security and labeled\nthe U.A.E. a country that has been linked to terrorism. Other members\nof Congress soon echoed the charges. Dubai Port World and the\ngovernment of Dubai hired lobbyists and public relations firms to blunt\nthe charges, but it was too late: Dubai Port World sold the U.S. port\nbusiness to another company.</p>\n<p>The emirate had learned its lesson. By March 2007, when another\ngovernment-owned firm, Dubai Aerospace Enterprises, acquired a pair of\naviation companies with operations at U.S. airports, Dubai already had\nin place a sophisticated lobbying operation that contacted some of the\nharshest critics of the ports deal to gain their support. Dubais\ngovernment relied on three firms to burnish its image: <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?lname=DLA+Piper&amp;year=2009\">DLA Piper</a><span class=\"printOnly\"> [2]</span>\nfocused on pushing political interests, the Mark Saylor Company focused\non crisis communications and Levick Strategic Communications handled\npress outreach and public relations campaigns.</p>\n<p>According to 2008 FARA filings, the Dubai government paid more than\n$4.6 million in fees to the three firms. Dubai Aerospace completed its\nacquisition in July 2007 without protest from Congress.</p>\n<p>The countrys public relations campaign continued in 2008. Lobbyists\npromoted such initiatives as Dubai Cares, to help educate children in\ndeveloping countries. They fielded questions about the ruling familys\nalleged abuse of jockeys in camel racing, and about Dubais sovereign\nwealth funds. The firms lobbyists met with dozens of congressional\nstaffers.

Board will post online a redacted copy of its $9.5 million contract with Smartronix Inc. for the redesign of Recovery.gov this week.</p>\r</p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.5in;\">Board chairman Earl Devaney told <em>Government Executive</em> last week that the board would be posting the contract online soon in part to pre-empt formal public records requests from watchdog groups. (The Sunlight Foundation had already submitted such a request for the final contract and winning bid on July 10, after prior efforts to obtain submitted proposals were unsuccessful.)</p>\r</p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.5in;\">Officials had declined to make the winning bid, and the resulting contract, available until after a \"protest period\" allowing losing bidders to voice complaints.The protest window closed this week with no complaints filed.</p>\r</p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.5in;\">The rule that calls for withholding the contract until the protest period is over raises the obvious question: How was anyone supposed to voice objections without seeing what they were objecting to?</p>\r</p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.5in;\">\"Unsuccessful offerors can protest based on several issues that do not require access to the contract document itself,\" a spokeswoman for the General Services Administration said in an e-mail to Sunlight. As for what those issues might include, <a href=\"http://www.arnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart%2033_1.html#wp1088680\">I read this and I'm still not quite sure.</a></p>\r</p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.5in;\">What is clear is that the complaints process is, on its face, designed to protect one contractor from a corrupt or incompetent competitor, government agency or both, and that it's also one of the layers of red tape that often mar contracting's reputation, inflating costs and extending deadlines.</p>\r</p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.5in;\">In the end, theoretically, justice will be served, albeit at a snail's pace. The disclosure of the contract comes on a similar time frame, an official seemed to acknowledge.</p>\r</p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.5in;\">\"We will get the contract up. It just might not be instantaneous as some would want,\" Devaney said in the <em>Government Executive</em> interview.</p>\r</p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.5in;\">The Recovery.gov contracting process, on the other hand, has been marked by seemingly nearly insurmountable deadlines. On June 15, the request for proposals was made available only to the select group of approved contractors eligible to bid, and those companies were given 11 days to prepare a complete proposal in response to the 47-page document.<span> </span>Some critics suggested that time frame could be met only by contractors with advance knowledge of the criteria.</p>\r</p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.5in;\">The Sunlight Foundation obtained a copy of the document and posted it online shortly after it was made available to potential bidders.

Pretty much at random, I picked out a bunch of congressional press releases touting stimulus dollars going to local communities, and started making calls. Here's some notes on where one inquiry led me.</p><p>\nRep. Kathy Dahlkemper of Pennsylvania's 3rd district (roughly the northwest corner of the state) put <a href=\"http://dahlkemper.house.gov/2009/03/rep-dahlkemper-announces-over-17-million-for-mercer-county-housing-authority.shtml\">this press release</a> on her Web site on March 24, announcing that, \"The Mercer County Housing Authority is slated to receive $1,703,727 as part of the Capital Fund Program.\" A second <a href=\"http://www.usaspending.gov/faads/faads.php?reptype=r&detail=3&datype=T&sortby=i&busn_indctr=r&database=faads&record_id=20395604&fiscal_year=2009\">reference</a> to the project can be found on USASpending.gov. The ultimate source of the funds is the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p><p>\nI called Mercer County Housing Authority and the regional HUD office to find out more about the project--what is its status, have contracts been awarded, are they reporting information to federal or state officials and if so what information are they reporting. Based on what I found, I ended up not asking some other questions: How many jobs had been created to date or exactly how much of the $1.7 million has been spent so far. It seems that this particular project is just getting started. I also learned that HUD's time line for spending stimulus dollars only requires that recipients have legally binding contracts in place within a year of funds being awarded--not that they spend a certain percentage of the funds available to them.</p><p>\nJim Cassidy, director of the HUD Office of Public Housing in Pittsburgh, Pa., said HUD awarded the funds through a block grant formula -- a complicated bit of algebra that divided among public housing authorities the stimulus money available for the Capital Fund Program. Cassidy told me that the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act directed $4 billion to the <a href=\"http://portal.hud.gov/portal/page?_pageid=153,7973149&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL\">Capital Fund Program</a>, which pays for development and modernization of public housing. \"$3 billion was awarded on a formula basis,\" he said; housing authorities will compete for the other $1 billion. </p><p>\nStimulus spending through the Capital Fund Program is being done on an expedited basis. I don't mean to sound flippant, but expedited for the federal government is a relative term: instead of projects having a four year life cycle, recipients will have to spend it in three years. The expedited time line goes like this: </p><p>\n<blockquote><b>March 18, 2009:</b> Funds obligated (that is, each public housing authority in the country receives approval letter saying they're getting a certain amount of money)</p><p><b>March 17, 2010:</b> Public housing authorities have to have a legally binding contract (or contracts) in place to spend the money.</p><p>By <b>March 17, 2011</b>, Public housing authorities are required to spend at least 60 percent of the stimulus funds they were awarded.</p><p>By <b>March 17, 2012</b>, PHAs are required to spend 100 percent of the stimulus funds awarded.</blockquote></p><p>\nSo how is this playing out on the ground? Beth Burkhart, the administrative director of the Mercer County Housing Authority, says they've decided how to spend their stimulus funds -- converting efficiency units in the <a href=\"http://www.mercercountyhousingauthority.com/Communities/VermeireManor/tabid/1271/Default.aspx\">Vermeire Manor</a> retirement home to one bedroom apartments -- and that HUD has approved the project. They have some firms lined up to do some of the work (this <a href=\"http://classifieds.cnhi.com/categoryadlist?test=1&publishername=sharonherald&adnumkey=0300&categoryname=Public%20Notice&datehunt=2009-06-26\">public notice</a> in the Sharon, Pa., Herald lists them -- Perfido Weiskopf Architects and asbestos contractor AGX, Inc.; they're still looking for help with plumbing, electrical work, HVAC and a general contractor). On July 2, they'll hold a pre-bid conference, with bids due on July 14. </p><p>\nI asked a lot of questions about what information would be reported to Recovery.gov, but both Cassidy and Burkhart explained that they had yet to receive that guidance from HUD, and just weren't sure yet what the reporting requirements would look like.  </p><p>\nCurrently, Recovery.gov has a <a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/sites/default/files/financial_and_activity_report_20090619HUD.xls\">spreadsheet</a> that tells you that $212,155,156 has been obligated for all of all of Pennsylvania under HUD's Capital Fund Program. Mercer County Housing Authority, or even the generic term \"public housing authority,\" doesn't appear. I didn't do as thorough a search, but I couldn't find a reference to the project on Pennsylvania's recovery site (here's the <a href=\"http://www.recovery.pa.gov/portal/server.pt?open=514&objID=519121&mode=2&countyname=Mercer&contentid=http://pubcontent.state.pa.us/publishedcontent/publish/marketingsites/recovery_pa_gov/content/impact/county_map/counties/mercer/mercer.html\">page for Mercer County projects</a>).", "date_published": "2009-06-29 20:55:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "open-notebook-following-stimulus-contracts", "tags": "Recovery.gov, Research, Stimulus Data, stimulus", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 1298, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:26", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 3, "timestamp": "2009-06-25 15:00:12", "image": "", "title": "The FOIA Process: Still as Archaic as Snail Mail", "excerpt": "", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are very few occasions in the Sunlight offices for us to use the fax machine, so we were somewhat out of practice when we learned that we had to use it to send Freedom of Information Act requests to the Department of Treasury.

We had to justify our request for a fee waiver in some calls, but most were devoted to patiently, politely cajoling FOIA officers to expedite our requests. It took us more than three months from the time the first FOIA was sent out to when we could compile all the material we needed to publish the story. All we wanted was a list of names of people in charge of making decisions about which bank gets money under the bailout--information that presumably shouldn't require a FOIA request.</p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"></p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite President Obama's January 21 directive to agencies to act in the spirit of openness and make an effort to improve the FOIA process, our recent experiences with Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others that regulate banks and are central to the bailout haven't been much different than our experiences with the Bush administration. Earlier, FOIA requests sent to Treasury took almost the same time, even without the phone calls trying to expedite the process.</p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"></p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The reason Treasury doesn't accept FOIA requests via e-mail is because of an internal regulation that requires the person making a request to submit a signature, according to Hugh Gilmore, the public FOIA liaison for the agency. Treasury also requires that they need a requester to say that they are willing to pay a minimum of $25.00 for the documents requested.</p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"></p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Acknowledging that the number of requests coming into Treasury as a result of the bailout and setting up of the Office of Financial Stability has increased, Gilmore said that they have added eight to ten people to handle the influx. \"We are changing the methods used to answer FOIA requests with the increased use of technology, especially for the Office of Financial Stability,\" Gilmore said. Keeping with the memo Treasury is changing internal policies and will be adopting amended provisions of transparency with regards to FOIA.</p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.sunshineingovernment.org/stats/highlights.pdf\">This report </a>by the Sunshine in Government Initiative looks at performance of federal agencies sums up the state of FOIA in 2008, \"Despite reforms enacted by Congress and an order from the last administration to do a better job, federal agencies continue to give those seeking information a frustrating and oftentimes unsatisfying experience.\"</p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"></p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In January 2007 when Real Time started to regularly seek logs of correspondence between Members of Congress and federal agencies, we sent out FOIA requests to more than 120 agencies.

And in the past two years only a dozen agencies have given us the logs of correspondences in the electronic format we've asked for--that is, as an excel or comma separated format.

But last week public-interest groups were dismayed when his own administration rejected a Freedom of Information Act request for Secret Service logs showing the identities of coal executives who had visited the White House to discuss Obama's \"clean coal\" policies. One reason: the disclosure of such records might impinge on privileged \"presidential communications.\" The refusal, approved by White House counsel Greg Craig's office, is the latest in a series of cases in which Obama officials have opted against public disclosure.</blockquote></p><p>Anu is our FOIA maven and is going to audit our FOIA log to see whether there's been any improvement in response times since Obama issued a <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Freedom_of_Information_Act/\">memorandum</a> stating, in part, \"All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure, in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA, and to usher in a new era of open Government. The presumption of disclosure should be applied to all decisions involving FOIA.\"</p><p>\nDon't take my word for it, but my guess is that we won't see much improvement.</p><p>\nWhile we wait for Anu to crunch the numbers, I thought an anecdote might be useful. Back in March 2007, I FOIAed the Office of Naval Research for information on a <a href=\"http://www.usaspending.gov/fpds/fpds.php?reptype=r&amp;detail=-1&amp;sortby=f&amp;datype=T&amp;reptype=r&amp;database=fpds&amp;database=fpds&amp;parent_id=58899&amp;fiscal_year=2006&amp;record_num=f500\">contract</a> it awarded to a company called Mobilvox. Mobilvox <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2007/01/08/small-business-hires-big-lobbyists/\">was of interest</a> for several reasons: they'd hired a bunch of different lobbyists -- the now defunct PMA Group, KSA Consulting (which employed Rep. John Murtha's brother), Chambers &amp; Associates (whose name partner worked for Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham), and GSP Consulting, a Pittsburgh-based firm that includes a former Murtha staffer. They'd gotten earmarks from both Murtha and Rep. James Moran, and they maintained offices in both districts.</p><p>\nWhen I FOIAed the Office of Naval Research, I asked for a copy of the above linked contract, any correspondence with ONR regarding the contract (including letters, emails, faxes, etc.), any forms SF-LLL (see <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2007/02/02/looking-into-lobbying-federal-contracts-and/\">here</a> for an explanation of what that is). I won't bore you with the details of my dealings with the two different private contractors that handle FOIA requests for ONR, or the multiple contacts I've gotten asking (perhaps hoping against hope) that I was no longer interested in seeing my FOIA request fulfilled.</p><p>\nIn January 2008, I received some of the pages of the contract (no correspondence yet). Missing were five pages that included the description of work to be performed and pricing information -- I learned last week that ONR \"is still in the process of working with the submitter regarding redacting these pages\" -- a full six months after I got part of the contract and fifteen months after I filed my initial FOIA request.</p><p>\nWaiting for FOIA requests was always like watching paint dry--it still is. Third party contractors still do a lot of the work of responding to FOIA requests and private entities mentioned in FOIA requests can review information requested and argue against its disclosure.

The software costs tens of thousands of dollars per copy.</p></p><p><p>In testimony in the suit, NGP Software, which bills itself \"the leading provider of fundraising and compliance software for Democratic campaigns\" on its Web site, acknowledged a hidden partnership with Capital Advantage under which NGP's software was re-branded and sold to PACs that, in the 2006 cycle, gave more to Republicans than they did to Republicans. NGP has for years scored points with Democratic congressional offices by advertising that it worked \"solely with Democrats and their allies.\" Aristotle casts itself as a nonpartisan technology provider.</p></p><p><p>When a reporter tried to obtain a copy of the partnership agreement with Capital Advantage last Octoberwhich like many records in the case was sealed to the publicNGP said she might be an agent of Aristotle.

The suit seeks all profits made by NGP by selling to Democrats.</p></p><p><p>Aristotle, founded in 1983, stressed its nonpartisan credentials as a provider of software for campaignsit boasts that the 1992 presidential campaigns of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot all used its software. The company dominated the market for filing software when the FEC first mandated that House and presidential campaigns and political action committees disclose their contributions electronically, but it has lost a tremendous amount of business to NGP in recent years.</p></p><p><p>NGP was paid $5.6 million in the 2008 election cycle by PACs and House and presidential candidates, compared to $2.8 million paid to Aristotle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. (The amount paid by Senate candidates is unknown because they do not file electronically.) Some 169 Democratic members of the House used NGP, while 147 members used Aristotleall but 35 of them Republicans.</p><p>Expenditure reports filed with the FEC show that Capital Advantage (now owned by the parent company of newspaper Roll Call) was paid $146,000 for helping groups that, at the time the suit was filed, were far more generous to Republicans than Democrats, raise money. A Web site paid for by Aristotle, <a href=\"http://www.notrobinhood.com\">NotRobinHood.com</a>, lists Republicans who have received money from those PACs, implying that Democrats who use NGP software are unwittingly supporting their political opponents.</p></p><p><p>But Capital Advantage has never worked directly for a Republican candidate, and while it did raise money for the RNC, the PACs it raised money for in 2008 gave slightly more money to Democrats than they did Republicans. Corporate PACs tend to support incumbents, and, with some exceptions of course, the party in control of Congress generally gets more support from them.</p></p><p><p>Aristotle says in court filings that NGP's fierce determination to keep the agreement secret proves its significance. NGP says they're not concerned with the truth coming out so much as they are with what Aristotle would do to \"misrepresent\" the facts.</p></p><p><p>The rival companies demanded every piece of information they could get out of each other, fishing for damaging information in discovery while agreeing to keep the information sealed from the public.

He began his career at Aristotle, but left to start his own company because he couldn't stand the thought of helping Republicans, he told the Wall Street Journal in 2006.</p></p><p><p>In court filings, NGP downplayed Pearlman's partisanship, arguing instead that Aristotle, whose revenues had actually increased from $8 million to $14 million during the period of NGP's alleged misconduct, couldn't prove it was harmed.

Jeff Flake has released a letter asking the Ethics Committee asking it to \"specifically prohibit members from being able to certify having no financial interest in an earmark when they have received campaign contributions from the entity that would benefit from the earmark or those affiliated with it.\" </p><p>\nEssentially, Flake is asking the committee to hold that, for earmarks, campaign contributions create a conflict of interest in the same way that, say, being part owner of a company would create a conflict of interest: The more flush the company is with federal contracts gotten through earmarks, the better off its (presumably greater number of) employees would be, and thus would have more donors with more money to contribute to the member's campaign. </p><p>\nPutting on a policy hat for a moment, in some ways <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=hr110-6\">H.Res. 6</a>, which required members to declare that neither they nor their spouses had a financial interest in the recipients to whom they were directing earmarked funds, opened the door to this. Congressional ethics rules (such as they are) deal with conflicts of interest not through prohibitions but through transparency. Thus, a member like Rep. Marion Berry of Arkansas can vote to increase <a href=\"http://cfra.blogspot.com/2006/07/rep-marion-berrys-farm-subsidy.html\">the farm subsidies</a> that he receives. It's up to voters in his district to determine whether that's a conflict of interest. Regulation of campaign contributions works the same way -- and, as <a href=\"http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/02/19/pma-investigation-looking-for-more-than-straw-men/\">previously noted</a> on Real Time, the Justice Department even assumes \"they are almost always given and received with a generalized expectation of currying favor with the candidate benefitting therefrom.\" </p><p>\nWhile members will most likely ignore it, Flake's letter raises some very interesting issues in how Congress deals with ethics regulations: is it better to prohibit behaviors, or make them transparent and trust to voters to decide the ethical boundaries. His letter also reminds me of how much in the dark we still are with so much of Congress. After all, with earmarks, we are talking a minute sliver of the federal budget.

A cooperative of 12 regional banks, the system works like this: banks, thrifts, credit unions and insurers (more than 8,100 across the country) become members and put up collateral; the FHLBs borrow money and lend it to th<img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com/images/blog/category/sf_subsidies.png\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; \" />em at a discount.</p>\r\n<meta content=\"text/html;charset=UTF-8\" http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" />\r\n<meta content=\"text/html;charset=UTF-8\" http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" />\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo where does the subsidy come in? Well, there&#39;s an implicit guarantee that if the home loan bank system were to fail, the government would bail it out, as it bailed out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last year. Because investors believe this, the FHLBs are able to borrow money at very low rates -- and therein lies the subsidy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe FHLBs provide a valuable service, especially to community banks that can&#39;t easily borrow money elsewhere. But on May 18, their regulator, <a href=\"http://www.fhfa.gov/\">the Federal Housing Finance Agency</a>, had <a href=\"http://www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/2331/FHFAReportToCongress2008final.pdf\">harsh words</a> for some of the FHLBs. Here&#39;s what it had to say about the Seattle bank:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Governance is unsatisfactory. [The bank&#39;s] financial condition is weakening... Earnings probably will not be sufficient to cover additional [losses] should [they] occur. Future losses could be substantial, and the FHLBank has no retained earnings with which to buffer additional losses.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe problem is that over the last few years, some of the FHLBs invested heavily in private mortgage-backed securities -- the same types of investments that lost much of their value during the housing crisis. The FHLBs <a href=\"http://www.fhlbtopeka.com/resources/Related/1112-FHLBs_Continue_to_Prosper_Amid_Housing_Market_Turmoil_9_23_08.pdf#page=2\">invested in very few securities</a> backed by subprime loans -- the so-called toxic assets we&#39;ve heard so much about of late. Nonetheless, the values of some of the FHLB investments have plunged -- and fast.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the space of just two months, for example, the ratings of about $1.4 billion of the Seattle bank&#39;s investments <a href=\"http://subsidyscope.com/projects/bailout/fhlb/#graphic1\">were downgraded from AAA to junk status</a>. That doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re now worthless, but it certainly increases the chances that they won&#39;t recover their full value. What&#39;s more, the Seattle bank was only holding about $1.7 billion in capital on December 31, 2008; that capital is meant to protect it against losses.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Seattle bank appears to be in the worst shape, but several of the FHLBs have run into similar problems, as <a href=\"http://subsidyscope.com/projects/bailout/fhlb/\">we detailed earlier this week at Subsidyscope.com</a>.</p>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com:80/uploads/FHLB_system_map.jpg\"><img height=\"285\" src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com:80/uploads/FHLB_system_map.jpg\" title=\"Source: Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston\" width=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\t<div style=\"margin: 0px 7px; width: 420px; font-size: 85%;\">\r\n\t\tThe 12 Federal Home Loan Banks, and the regions they cover.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn May, when they released their <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=federal+home+loan+bank&amp;match=contains&amp;CIK=&amp;filenum=&amp;State=&amp;SIC=&amp;owner=include&amp;action=getcompany\">first quarter numbers</a>, several of the FHLBs took substantial &quot;unrealized losses,&quot; largely because of the private mortgage-backed securities. Because the banks believe these losses are temporary, they don&#39;t have to be recognized on their accounting statements.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe unrealized losses were quite large in some cases. The Seattle bank <a href=\"http://subsidyscope.com/projects/bailout/fhlb/#graphic2\">had far more unrealized losses than it had capital</a>, which could raise problems if some of them are realized in the future.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd the Seattle FHLB has already exhausted many of the buffers it had to protect against future shortfalls. For example, at the end of 2008, it became the first Federal Home Loan Bank in the system&#39;s history to run out of retained earnings, an important safeguard against losses.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHome loan bank representatives say the setbacks are merely temporary because they intend to hold the securities to maturity. By then, they predict, the economy will have improved and these holdings will have recovered their value.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBesides, spokespeople say, the FHLB system as a whole has enough capital to recover from any future losses, even if a few of the banks were to come up short.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn an e-mail, a spokesperson for the Seattle bank said the downgraded securities are &quot;still performing,&quot; and that the unrealized losses are &quot;driven by depressed market prices, rather than actual economics.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStill, some analysts have concerns. &quot;[T]he kind of numbers you&#39;re talking about would suggest a significant amount of stress,&quot; said Mark Flannery, professor of&nbsp;</p>\r\n<meta content=\"text/html;charset=UTF-8\" http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" />\r\n<p>\r\n\tfinance at the University of Florida, Gainesville, and co-author of the 2006 report, <a href=\"http://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/erq306_frame.pdf\">&quot;The Federal Home Loan Bank System: The &quot;Other&quot; Housing GSE.&quot;</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pen_ink.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; width: 160px; height: 240px; \" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrivate mortgage-backed securities are much riskier, however. In January, Moody&#39;s was already raising concerns about the FHLBs&#39; capital levels, based on data from October 2008. It reported that in the worst-case scenario, if the FHLBs&#39; securities didn&#39;t regain their value, eight of the 12 banks would fail to meet their capital requirements, raising risks for taxpayers. Further complicating the picture, the Financial Accounting Standards Board loosened the accounting rules that govern the home loan banks. In the case of the Seattle bank, the net income on its books as of March 31 would have been <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1329701/000119312509115859/d10q.htm#tx96202_4\">$823 million lower</a>without the rule change.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRegardless, Timothy Yeager, a professor of finance at the University of Arkansas and a former economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, thinks the home loan banks will remain strong. &quot;They have the means to straighten this out, and in the end, they&#39;ll be fine,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#39;ll get their capital levels back over time.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut some charge that a few of the FHLBs have endangered their mission to make homeownership affordable by making such risky investments. &quot;The Federal Home Loan Banks received so many benefits from government that one would have expected them to manage their affairs more prudently,&quot; said Tom Stanton, fellow at the Center for the Study of American Government at Johns Hopkins University and a specialist in government-sponsored enterprises like the FHLBs. &quot;Given their low cost of funds and the agency debt markets, they didn&#39;t need to take on risky assets in order to thrive and carry out their public purposes.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t---</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPhotos by:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/34748725@N00/3253978511/\">ChicagoGeek</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.fhlbboston.com/\">Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/artemfinland/3087559176/\">ArtemFinland</a></p>\r\n", "date_published": "2009-06-02 15:14:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "investment-ratings-tank-for-home-loan-banks", "tags": "Lobbying, federal home loan banks, fhlb, fhlbs, subsidies, subsidy, subsidyscope", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 1190, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:26", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2009-05-29 17:49:12", "image": "", "title": "CREW visualizes Murtha web", "excerpt": "", "content": "Here's a <a href=\"http://www.crewsmostcorrupt.org/you-dont-know-jack\">picture</a> worth well over a thousand words: Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has assembled an interactive, \"You Don't Know Jack\" graphic showing the connections between Murtha, a trio of lobbying firms, relatives, staffers and the companies for whom he's gotten earmarks. </p><p>\nWell worth a look.

Jerry Lewis, former chair and now ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, earmarked $96 million for firms represented by Innovative Federal Strategies, which was once under federal investigation:</p><p>\n<blockquote>Inland Rep. Jerry Lewis is requesting more than $96 million in federal earmarks for clients of Washington lobbyists whose dealings with the veteran lawmaker were part of a criminal investigation launched three years ago.</p><p>\nWould-be recipients of the earmarks, including Inland cities, agencies, hospitals and defense contractors with local branches, paid more than $1.3 million to the firm -- more than a third of its total lobbying revenue, records show.</p><p>\nAs the top Republican on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, Lewis, R-Redlands, is well positioned to influence spending bills. Despite the scrutiny and criticism of earmarks -- spending requests lawmakers insert into bills, often for projects in their districts -- Lewis remains unapologetic about his funding requests. </blockquote></p><p>\nLast week, I started poking into the same earmark disclosure list, and put together a little database of the disclosures that's available <a href=\"https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/jerrylewisearmarkrequests/uInmnDpt\">here</a> -- I include links to the lobbying disclosures of those intended recipients that had hired K Street representatives. </p><p>\nA few things that struck me: <b>1)</b> Lewis did the same thing back in 2007. Kevin Bogardus of The Hill <a href=\"http://thehill.com/business--lobby/lobbying-firm-linked-to-rep.-lewis-booms-despite-federal-investigation-2007-08-15.html\">reported</a> in August 2007 -- that was before the federal investigation of Innovative Federal Strategies <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/004093.php#more\">seemed to unravel</a> -- that Lewis sponsored or co-sponsored earmarks in the defense appropriations bill worth $55 million for clients of Innovative Federal Strategies for fiscal year 2008. So the FY2010 requests are par for the course. Compare that to, say, Rep. Peter Visclosky, under investigation for his ties to PMA Group, who didn't request <a href=\"http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/04/03/visclosky-shuts-out-former-pma-group-clients/\">any earmarks</a> for the firm's former clients according to his disclosures. <b>2)</b> When I ran the contribution numbers for 2010 (just the first quarter numbers) from Innovative Federal Strategies' clients to Lewis, they weren't particularly robust: from <a href=\"http://fec.gov/DisclosureSearch/HSRefreshContributorList.do?election_yr=2010&contComeFrom=candList&cand_id=H8CA37079&contCategory=INDIVIDUAL&category=searchCand&searchKeyword=LEWIS\">individuals</a>, $4,600 from a pair of ESRI executives; from <a href=\"http://fec.gov/DisclosureSearch/HSRefreshContributorList.do?election_yr=2010&contComeFrom=candList&cand_id=H8CA37079&contCategory=PAC&category=searchCand&searchKeyword=LEWIS\">PACs</a>, nothing. I ran the numbers for the 2008 cycle as well using CRP's open, coded data (I didn't run cities and towns and I only ran FY2010 earmark request beneficiaries, which excluded prior earmark recipients and contributors like SAIC and General Atomics), and came up with $34,600 from employees, family members and PACs of Innovative Federal Strategies to Lewis' campaign and leadership PAC--nothing to sneeze at, but not exactly on a par with campaign money from PMA Group and its clients. Visclosky, for example, took in $369,750 in the 2008 election cycle, according to our fine friends at the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/PMA_and_Clients_to_111th.xls\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>. On the other hand, Visclosky took in <a href=\"http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/04/16/hill-no-campaign-cash-for-visclosky-from-former-pma-group-clients/\">nothing</a> from former PMA Group clients in the first quarter of 2010. <b>3)</b> I counted 32 requests for clients of Innovative Federal Strategies, and overall there were 61 requests asking for more than $166 million for recipients--towns, universities, municipal water authorities, defense contractors, Indian tribes--that had hired lobbyists. Jim Specht, Lewis' spokesman, told me that the \"vast majority\" of groups that ask them for earmarks have hired a lobbyist. He said he couldn't speak to why this was the case. This still strikes me as the biggest question about earmarks. Lawmakers defend earmarks by arguing that they know their districts -- do they, or do they know lobbyists who know their districts? Lewis also requested 28 earmarks potentially worth more than $51 million for entities that </i>haven't</i> hired a lobbyist. <b>4)</b> It's so much more interesting to start delving into these lists than it is to go hunting for them all hours of the night in the dark recesses of congressional Web sites. </p><p>\nSome questions off the observations: <b>1)</b> How many members have a similar ratio (2/3s of requests go to recipients represented by lobbyists)? Is it the norm? Or a deviation, the result of Lewis' position on the Appropriations Committee? <b>2)</b> These are <i>requests</i> for earmarks, not funded, signed-sealed-and-delivered earmarks. So what does the final percentage end up looking like? And what about the money split? Does it remain at roughly $1 in earmarked money for those who don't hire lobbyists vs. $3.25 in earmarked money for those that do? <b>3)</b> Would following this and tracking these percentages potentially say more about the efficacy of lobbyists, who spend part of their time trying to persuade members of Congress that the priorities of their clients are higher than those of everyone else?", "date_published": "2009-05-26 21:27:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "delving-into-rep-lewis-earmark-requests", "tags": "Campaign Finance, Earmark request disclosures, Earmarks, Innovative Federal Strategies, Rep.

Molycorp is primarily owned by Resource Capital Fund IV L.P., Pegasus Partners IV, LP, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and Traxys North America LLC. As the owner of one of the world's richest rare earth deposit outside of China and a leader in rare earth technology development, Molycorp's expertise has provided breakthroughs in industries as varied as military, computing and automotive. As the leading western supplier, Molycorp markets rare earth materials from its world class rare earth deposit and mining operation in Mountain Pass, California. In addition, Molycorp maintains a joint venture with Sumitomo Metals, called Sumikin Molycorp, which markets rare earth products in Asia and produces permanent magnet materials in Japan.</blockquote></p><p>\nI was looking for a different connection in connection with Molycorp and didn't find it (I'm totally in fishing mode, so about 99.999999 percent of the stuff I'm looking at tonight is precisely what I am not looking for) but I thought it was interesting enough on its own merits that it warranted a post.

The latter, chaired by Rep. David Obey, requires members post their earmark requests online <b>before</b> they submit them to the committee. Oberstar, by contrast \"set a May 14 deadline for Members to submit requests and encouraged them to post the requests on their Web sites, but he stopped short of setting a mandatory deadline,\" according to Roll Call.

I wanted to take a look at a vote my colleague Paul Blumenthal <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/04/30/they-frankly-own-the-place/\">referred to</a> with the title (quoting Sen. Richard Durbin) \"They own the place.\" The \"they\" in question are financial sector firms, the place is Congress; at issue is a bill, the <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s896/show\">Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009</a> -- or rather, an <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/articles/view/965-Durbin-s-Cramdown-Amendment\">amendment</a> to that bill -- that was voted down by a 51-45 margin.</p><p>\nThe <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/articles/view/965-Durbin-s-Cramdown-Amendment\">Durbin amendment</a>, also known as the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/30/mortgages-cramdowns-senate-business-cramdown.html\">cram down bill</a>, would have removed the mortgage exemption from bankruptcy proceedings, allowing bankruptcy judges some leeway to rewrite the terms of mortgages which in turn might prevent a lot of foreclosures. It's fairly clear that Wall Street opposed the measure (<a href=\"http://www.fsround.org/policy/pstatements/pdfs/Bankruptcy_JointSenateLetter_042909.pdf\">here's</a> a letter from a bunch of financial industry, business and Wall Street trade groups that begins, \"The undersigned organizations are strongly opposed to a bankruptcy cram down amendment that is likely to be offered by Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL) to S. 896...\"). </p><p>\nSadly, what we find out about the industry's efforts to influence members of Congress we only discover in retrospect. To go back to the Durbin amendment: The vote was on April 30, which falls squarely in the second quarter of 2009, so we won't see campaign contributions and lobbying activity until after the quarter ends. (Lobbying filings for the second quarter are due on July 20, 2009; campaigns file their contribution records on July 15, 2009). So the gaggles of lobbyists disclosing an interest in the bill won't turn up til later; neither will the PAC contributions or the bundles of individual contributions from interests that opposed the bill. </p><p>\nSo, I'm going to run the <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/roll_call/show/5519\">nay voters</a>, in alphabetical order, through <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org\">Party Time</a> to see what turns up. Did lobbyists and PACs of interests opposed to the cram down host fundraisers for members of Congress around the time of the vote? Some caveats, of course, are in order: Party Time, sadly, is not a complete database of fundraisers. Some of those fundraisers for which we do have information list hosts who can be tied to specific interests, but many of them list no host, or the hosts are lobbyists who represent many clients. Then again, just because agricultural interests are hosting a fundraiser for a member doesn't mean that employees or lobbyists of a financial institution can't show up. And, of course, two-thirds of our senators aren't in campaign mode -- they don't face voters again until 2012 or 2014 -- so we might not see fundraisers for them. Like many of the things we do, we're starting by saying, <i>we have no idea what value this adds, but it seems worth playing with a while to see what falls out.</i></p><p>\nIn addition to Party Time, I'm also going to check <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org\">OpenSecrets.org</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov\">FEC site</a> and the <a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=chooseFields\">Senate Office of Public Records lobbying database</a> to see what turns up there--again, none of those filings will cover the weeks leading up to the April 30 vote or its aftermath, but perhaps we can find a few clues there.</p><p>\nThat said, let's take a look and see what we can see. I'll be fumbling through this the next couple of days or so, doing ten or so members at a time. Here's the first batch...</p><p>\n<strong>Sen. Lamar Alexander:</strong> Nothing in 2009.

Max Baucus</strong> is the politician you want to contribute to if you're into <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Beneficiary/baucus/\">snow mobiling, fishing, camping or golf</a>. At three of the four events he's hosted or will host in 2009, Baucus is raising money for his leadership PAC, the Glacier PAC; sadly, the FEC has <a href=\"http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00353953\">no info</a> on 2009 contributions. Baucus also raised, in the first quarter of 2009, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary2010.php?type=I&amp;cid=N00004643&amp;newMem=N\">$216,534</a> for his campaign committee. The contributions can be accessed <a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00328211\">here</a> in a nonsearchable format -- I flipped through the first couple of pages and saw a lot of contributions from employees of Patton Boggs.</p><p><strong>Sen. Michael Bennett:</strong> Has <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Beneficiary/Michael%20Bennett/\">three fundraisers</a> in 2009. One <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/party/8409/\">hosted</a> by (and at the offices of) law and lobbying firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, which represents, among <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?lname=Akin%2C+Gump+et+al&amp;year=2009\">others</a>, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which <a href=\"http://www.fsround.org/policy/pstatements/pdfs/Bankruptcy_JointSenateLetter_042909.pdf\">opposes</a> the bill. Akin Gump didn't list it though among their <a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=ed97e761-6156-4f33-b138-ddfb3273de0b\">lobbying issues</a> in the first quarter of 2009; it will be worth looking it up in the second quarter though. Tony Podesta hosted another fundraiser for Bennett; he <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lobbyist.php?lname=Podesta%2C+Anthony&amp;id=U00000022361&amp;year=2009\">represents, among others</a>, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; again, worth checking that lobbying disclosure form in July...</p><p><strong>Sen. Bob Bennett:</strong> Okay, <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Beneficiary/Bob%20Bennett/\">lots</a> to look at.

I'd love to know who showed up at his <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/party/9983/\">April 29 fundraiser</a> which featured special guest Sen. Thad Cochran. The <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/party/11182/\">May 6 fundraiser</a> looks like it's being hosted by phone company lobbyists, while the <a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/party/9383/\">April 11 breakfast</a> looks like it's been hosted by a group of lobbyists who represent health care (and other) interests--one of the hosts appears to be a <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=26732\">former Bennett staffer</a>.</p><p><b>Sen.

Murtha, the Pennsylvania Democrat who has significant sway over the Defense Department's spending as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee.</p></div><p></p><p>Robert Murtha said he is not at liberty to discuss in detail what his company does, but for four years it has subsisted on defense contracts, according to records and interviews. He said Murtech's 17 employees \"provide necessary logistical support\" to Pentagon testing programs that focus on detecting chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats, \"and that's about as far as I feel comfortable going.\" Giving more details could give important clues to terrorist plotters, he said</blockquote></p><p>\nThere's more:</p><p>\n<blockquote>Murtha's power has had beneficial effects within his family. His brother, Robert C. \"Kit\" Murtha, built a longtime lobbying practice around clients seeking defense funds through the Appropriations Committee and became one of the top members of KSA, a lobbying firm whose contractor clients often received multimillion-dollar earmarks directed through the Appropriations chairman.</p><p>\nRobert C. Murtha Jr. of Murtech is Kit Murtha's son. He also is a former Marine who once served as a presidential security officer and aide to the president for White House functions. He worked for eight years for ACS, a defense and information technology contractor. When Lockheed purchased ACS in 2004, he started several companies, including Murtech, which he registered as a defense contracting firm.</blockquote></p><p>\nRead the whole thing.</p>", "date_published": "2009-05-05 03:38:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "congress-family-business-john-murtha-edition2", "tags": "Congress' Family Business, Media, Rep.

We continue to find that even some of the most elementary details about the program -- like who is actually managing distribution of the bailout money to financial institutions -- is still shrouded in secrecy.<p>\r\nAt Sunlight we've been contacting the agencies responsible for reviewing applications for TARP funds made by banks including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Thrift Supervision and the and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency to provide us a list of people involved in deciding which bank gets how much money under TARP. In <a href=\"http://realtime.sunlightprojects.org/2009/04/10/who%E2%80%99s-manning-the-tarp-desk/\">\"Who's Manning the TARP Desk\"</a>, we documented the process bank regulators follow while deciding if a bank should get bailout money, and identified the officials--all holdovers from the Bush administration--who make the final decisions on disbursing TARP funds at Treasury. But they rely on analysis that come from the FDIC, OTC and the OCC. So we contacted those agencies to find out who does those reviews.</p><p>\r\nAt first the FDIC's press spokesperson refused giving out names of the people involved, telling us, \"There is no list of people that makes the decision, it's made by the applications department.\" Then they asked us to make a Freedom of Information Act request, which we did.</p><p>\r\nIn answer to the FOIA, Sunlight received an email that might best be described as a hedged response. The email contained about 20 bios with a caveat: \"[W]hile it is assumed that some of these persons may participate in the oversight or coordination of some of the FDIC's activities with respect to 'TARP,' we have not confirmed and are not representing that all of these persons did, in fact, review, oversee or coordinate all of any of the applications about which your initial request pertains.\" According to the FOIA officer, this information is not traditionally disclosed. They also noted that, under FOIA rules, they are not obligated to create lists (or documents or reports or anything else) -- only to release documents that already exist. Apparently the FDIC maintains no list of people authorized to review applications from banks requesting TARP funds.</p><p>\r\nAs to the series of bios that the FDIC put together for us: a handful of the employees (who may or may not have something to do with TARP) come from banking firms or have worked on Capitol Hill as staffers for committees that oversee the banking industry. Sandra Thompson, Director of FDIC's Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection, worked with Goldman Sachs as an associate before moving to work with the FDIC. Martin Gruenberg, Vice Chairman, FDIC, served as Senior Counsel for Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., and on the staff of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Gruenberg's work on legislation included Sarbanes-Oxley, a bill that required more corporate accountability in the wake of the Enron scandal.</p><p>\r\nThe FDIC was actually more forthcoming with information than other agencies that review bank applications for TARP funds. For example, the one person I was able to contact at OTS (by no means the only person I tried to contact) agreed to speak, strictly on background, about the process and detailed information that banks have to submit, but declined to name people involved and said that most of the decisions were made by \"senior management.\"</p><p>\r\nMeanwhile, the composition of the TARP Investment Committee -- the body at Treasury that makes final determinations on TARP funds -- is changing. The Obama administration <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/13/AR2009041303257.html\">appointed</a> Herbert M. Allison Jr. -- who ran Fannie Mae for the Bush administration after the government seized the troubled institution in 2008 -- to replace Neel Kashkari as assistant secretary for financial stability.

The evaluation process begins with an FBA consultation which includes a review of the bank's most recent financial statements and quarterly data.

Over the weekend, I started looking at the disclosures, more to see what format the disclosures were in rather than whether they were online by a certain time. Since Roll Call <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/01/06/inouye-obey-promise-earmark-reforms/\">first reported</a> the changes, this has been a <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/01/06/inouye-obey-promise-earmark-reforms/#comment-49336\">concern</a> of mine. </p><p>\nIf members used the same format for disclosure, it would be a simple matter for us or anyone else to download all the data and put them into an online tool like <a href=\"http://www.earmarkwatch.org\">Earmark Watch</a> that lets constituents research projects in their area and comment on them. Instead, there's no consistency at all in formats--we have everything from PDF image files (pictures of pages that can't be searched) to elaborate charts--pretty much what I predicted <a href=\"http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/01/06/inouye-obey-promise-earmark-reforms/#comment-49336\">here</a>.  I'm happy to see that Joe Germuska <a href=\"http://blog.germuska.com/2009/04/06/more-like-translucent-than-transparent/\">has tried to parse</a> a few of these. He proves that smart programmers can make with this data more useful than I thought. That said, I'd much rather see what he could do to make formatted data more accessible, rather than spending his time fixing the data out of the starting block.</p><p>\nIn my review of Web sites over the weekend, I missed several I should have seen. The most embarrassing oversight for me was missing, on her <a href=\"http://wassermanschultz.house.gov/\">home page</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/fl20_schultz/AppropsFY10.html\">disclosures</a> of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schulz. The one thing I tried to be meticulous about was that I'd read every single word on every single home page--there would be nothing worse than saying I couldn't find something when someone had a big red flashing button saying \"Earmarks here\" on their home page. Wasserman Schulz had part of the release on the page, but I missed it the first time and also couldn't see it after an aide told me about it. I think that's because she disclosed on March 20 -- much earlier than anyone else (of the members who dated their disclosures, a few came in on March 31, but  most were in April). I think seeing the March 20 date was enough to make my eyes ignore the text of the release, despite my vow to read whole home pages. My fault.</p><p>\n(On a few occasions I did have trouble spotting things on home pages -- for whatever reason, it took me a long while to spot the link to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's <a href=\"http://www.house.gov/pelosi/CommunityFundingRequests/\">requests</a> on her <a href=\"http://www.house.gov/pelosi/\">home page</a>.

I can't be sure, but I <a href=\"https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/seemembersearmarkrequests-1/ztqMeVhe\">tried to find out over the weekend</a>. I went through 430-some Web sites (there are a few vacancies right now -- Rahm Emanuel's seat, Hilda Solis' seat, and Kirsten Gillibrand's seat) looking for those disclosures (sometimes it was really interesting, sometimes it was thankless drudgery). On 116 Web pages, I couldn't find any earmark disclosures (some of these may be from members who don't disclose earmarks -- I used the Club for Growth's <a href=\"http://clubforgrowth.org/2009/02/swearing_off_pork_in_2009.php\">list</a> of earmark abstainers, but found that some members on it -- like <a href=\"http://www.hunter.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=126&amp;Itemid=60\">Rep.

Some members posted unreadable pdfs (I indicated this sometimes in the notes). Some posted charts. Some have press releases for every single earmark, others have downloadable Word documents. Some members posted the complete request letters (again, I tried to indicate this), others posted the bare minimum amount of information.</p><p>\nHave a look at <a href=\"https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/seemembersearmarkrequests-1/ztqMeVhe\">what I found</a>, and if I've missed things, please leave them in comments below.

Another note: in some of the comments, I noted whether or not the disclosure was hard to find. This was largely subjective, but basically, if I had to scroll to the bottom of a lengthy page that seemed to have nothing do with earmarks to find the disclosure, I labeled it hard to find. These were definitely hard for me to find, anyway...</p><p>\n<strong>Update 2:</strong> There are 292 members who had earmark disclosures online when I finished my work.

Therefore, none shall be vested elsewhere.</blockquote></p><p>\nWill includes this bit of history about the dangers of allowing the Executive Branch too much discretion in how money shall be spent:</p><p>\n<blockquote>Writing in the New Republic, Jeffrey Rosen of George Washington University Law School makes a prudential point: \"The military-spending scandals during World War II, exposed by the Truman Committee, showed the risks for corruption and fraud when the executive branch is given a free hand to spend vast amounts of money.\" But even in the unlikely event that the executive branch exercises its excessive EESA discretion efficiently, the mere exercise would nevertheless subvert the principle of separation of powers, which, as Justice Louis Brandeis said, was adopted \"not to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power.\" </blockquote></p><p>\nThis seems to be remarkably close to how some members of Congress defend their earmarks. <a href=\"http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/73804/\">Via Instapundit</a>, here's John Murtha's <a href=\"http://www.tribune-democrat.com/local/local_story_077234514.html\">response</a> to charges he wasted a lot of taxpayer money on projects that were vetted, not by a rigorous procurement process with competitive bids, but rather through some backroom process known only to Murtha, his staff and lobbyists:</p><p>\n<blockquote>U.S. Rep.

Contrast the treatment financial companies got from the <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h1424/show\">Emergency Economic Stabilization Act</a>, which lavished <a href=\"http://www.subsidyscope.com/projects/bailout/tarp/\">billions</a> on bank holding companies, financial firms and other big donors, with the misleadingly named <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s109-256\">Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005</a>, which shifted the burden of irresponsible lending practices by credit card companies and irresponsible borrowing and buying by credit card holders entirely onto the latter. It is perhaps needless to say that employees, their immediate family members, and PACs of <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/contrib.php?cycle=2008&ind=F06\">credit card companies</a> are far more generous supporters of political campaigns than people struggling to make ends meet and thinking of defaulting on their debts. </p><p>\nOverwhelming majorities of politicians in the <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=s2005-44\">Senate</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h2005-108\">House</a> proved themselves to be perfectly willing to sacrifice the protections that bankruptcy laws afforded to ordinary citizens. Similarly, politicians of both parties--including free market conservatives opposed to government interventions in markets and anti-big-business liberals who'd railed against the excesses of Wall Street--were only too happy to make American taxpayers bail out their big donors. </p><p>\nFinancial firms get it: It's not what politicians say, it's what they do.

Christopher Dodd, the powerful chairman of the Senate banking committee, according to an internal Countrywide document turned over to congressional investigators and obtained by The Courant.</blockquote></p><p>\nThe Courant notes that the report, some 63 pages long, is from House Republicans on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee -- the whole thing is <a href=\"http://republicans.oversight.house.gov/News/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=487\">here</a>. I think it's significant because we're beginning to get more detail about how Countrywide Financial's programs worked:</p><p>\n<blockquote>An internal \"Loan Policy Analysis\" of Dodd's mortgages shows that Countrywide's underwriting rules called for an interest rate of 4.875 percent on both loans, with fees equal to three-eighths of a point on one loan, and a quarter-point on the other. A point is equal to 1 percent of the borrowed amount, and for both mortgages, those up-front fees would have totaled about $2,500.</p><p>\nBut the computerized record includes a second column showing what Dodd and his wife, Jackie Clegg, were actually charged. In that column, the points had been eliminated.</p><p>\nAccording to investigators, Countrywide's computer system required a manual override to implement loan terms more favorable than the company's standard underwriting policy. In Dodd's computer files, in a column labeled \"Reason For Override,\" is the designation: \"CMD Approved\" \" which investigators say is shorthand for approval by a Countrywide managing director. Similar overrides are noted in loan documents for many other VIPs, investigators said.</blockquote></p><p>\nKevin Rennie, meanwhile, raises <a href=\"http://www.courant.com/news/opinion/columnists/hc-rennie-dodd-aig-houses0322.artmar22,0,5605159.column\">more questions</a> about Dodd's Irish \"cottage,\" also in the <i>Hartford Courant</i>.

President Obama is high on the list, having collected $905,700 from the firm and its clients, ranking him fourth among all recipients after Murtha, Visclosky and Moran. One caveat about Obama's total: Because presidential contenders raise so much more money than congressional candidates, they tend to rank highly on lists like this one.

No one mentioned that Dodd and Downe together purchased a condominium in Washington, D.C., in 1986. Dodd bought Downe's share 3 1/2 years later.</p><p>\nWhen Dodd owned a condominium with Downe in the 1980s, while Downe was carrying on his illegal stock scheme, no details of their arrangement were in the deed or mortgage filings.Who paid which expenses associated with owning the condominium didn't fall into the public's view. Neither did who used the condominium.</p><p>\nIt raises the prospect that a senator, working much of the time in Washington, could have had his living expenses subsidized when the senator owned that real estate with a rich New York socialite. Even members of the smart set can be in only one place at a time. Downe already had homes in some of the nation's finest neighborhoods when he bought the D.C. condominium with Dodd, who used to be called, but no more, one of the poorest members of the Senate.</p><p>\nDodd was never required to name Kessinger (on Senate disclosures) as the co-owner of their house on 10 acres of waterfront property on the west coast of Ireland for the eight years they owned it together. As with the condominium, the public doesn't know who paid the expenses associated with it when Kessinger owned two-thirds of it.</blockquote></p><p>\nHere's an image of what Dodd disclosed about his cottage in his calendar year 2000 financial disclosure form (filed in 2001):</p><p>\n<a href=\"http://pfds.opensecrets.org/N00000581_00.pdf\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://media.sunlightprojects.org/realtime/images/wp/Dodddisclosure.jpg\" title=\"Dodd disclosure\" class=\"alignnone\" width=\"503\" height=\"102\" /></a></p><p>\nNote that Dodd doesn't disclose the owners of the other 2/3s of his Irish \"cottage\" -- nor is he required to. Shouldn't we know who politicians are buying properties with? Given the number of members who've run into ethical questions regarding homes and vacation homes (Sen. Ted Stevens, Rep. Charlie Rangel and Rep. Alan Mollohan spring immediately to mind) shouldn't we have more disclosure about member's real property?</p><p>\n<b>Bonus Update:</b> As I was trying to upload the image from Dodd's PDF to this file, I had a chat with Kevin Rennie, the intrepid investigator who has unearthed the information on Dodd.

As good a story as it is ... here's an excerpt clipped from <a href=\"http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/70354/\">InstaPundit</a> ... </p><p>\n<blockquote>    More than 100 House members secured earmarks in a major spending bill for clients of a single lobbying firm \" The PMA Group \" known for its close ties to John P. Murtha , the congressman in charge of Pentagon appropriations.</p><p>\n    It shows you how good they were, said Keith Ashdown, chief investigator at the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense. The sheer coordination of that would take an army to finish.</p><p>\n    PMA's offices have been raided, and the firm closed its political action committee last week amid reports that the FBI is investigating possibly illegal campaign contributions to Murtha and other lawmakers. . . . In the spending bill managed by Murtha, the fiscal 2008 Defense appropriation, 104 House members got earmarks for projects sought by PMA clients, according to Congressional Quarterly's analysis of a database constructed by Ashdown's group.</p><p>\n    Those House members, plus a handful of senators, combined to route nearly $300 million in public money to clients of PMA through that one law (PL 110-116).</p><p>\n    And when the lawmakers were in need \" as they all are to finance their campaigns \" PMA came through for them.</blockquote></p><p>\n...here comes the big but: it's doubtful that any of that activity will ever land any of those lawmakers in hot water. </p><p>\nPMA Group appears to be in trouble not because of earmarks or for fluffing up the campaign accounts of members of Congress with legitimate donations (they've been a <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/usearch/searchresults_detailed.php?srch_term=PMA%20Group&type=O&cnt=40&filter=tm\">top fluffer</a> for a remarkable number of members), but rather for what appear to be <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/13/AR2009021302746.html?hpid=topnews\">illegal donations</a> made through a straw donor. And while it's illegal for, say, me to reimburse you for a campaign contribution, lawmakers have taken such contributions and not gotten in any trouble at all. (See <a href=\"http://www.indianexpress.com/oldstory.php?storyid=41457\">Majumder, Bob</a>, for an example that also involves John Murtha.)</p><p>\nQuid pro quos are illegal, but there are <a href=\"http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm02046.htm\">serious hurdles</a> to using campaign contributions in any quid pro quo investigation:</p><p>\n<blockquote><b>Campaign Contributions</b></p><p>\nA bribery charge can be premised on a campaign contribution. But be careful. It is problematical that a gratuity charge under 201(c) can rest on a bona fide campaign contribution, unless the contribution was a ruse that masqueraded for a gift to the personal benefit of the public officer as was the case in Brewster, supra. This is because campaign contributions represent a necessary feature of the American political process, they normally inure to the benefit of a campaign committee rather than directly to the personal benefit of a public officer, and they are almost always given and received with a generalized expectation of currying favor with the candidate benefitting therefrom. For these reasons, recent Federal jurisprudence on the subject suggests substantial judicial reluctance to extend the Federal crime of gratuities under section 201(c) to bona fide campaign donations.</p><p>\nPRACTICE TIP: Where the transaction represents a bona fide campaign contribution, prosecutors must normally be prepared to prove that it involved a quid pro quo understanding and thereby constituted a \"bribe\" offense actionable under section 201(b).</p><p>\nCOMMENT: This same distinction between bribes, gratuities and lawful campaign contributions has recently been applied to some of the Federal prosecutive theories that are currently used to address bribery and corruption by state and local public officials. For example, in McCormick v. United States, 500 U.S. 257 (1991) the Supreme Court held that the Hobbs Act (18 U.S.C.  1951) did not apply to a series of campaign contributions that were made with a general intent to curry favor with a state senator and to thank him for his support. Noting that campaign contributions are a necessary part of the American political process, the Court held that when an allegedly corrupt payment represents a bona fide campaign contribution, the prosecution must prove the existence of a quid pro quo. This principle was thereafter affirmed shortly thereafter in Evans v. United States, 504 U.S. 255 (1992).</blockquote></p><p>\nThis reminds me of what Rep. Tim Holden said <a href=\"http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/presscenter/articles/2008/06/08/earmarked-profits/\">when asked</a> about getting earmarks for a PMA Group client (PMA Group is a big Holden contributor):</p><p>\n<blockquote>''Who is going to contribute to your campaign, people you don't help?'' Holden said, before adding: ''There is no quid pro quo here.''</blockquote></p><p>\nIt will be interesting to see where the PMA probe goes, but I'd be surprised if any of the hundred lawmakers running into trouble for earmarking funds for clients of a big campaign contributor.", "date_published": "2009-02-19 20:07:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "pma-investigation-looking-for-more-than-straw-men", "tags": "Earmarks, Murtha, PMA Group, Washington ethics", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 622, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:28", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2009-02-17 17:55:12", "image": "", "title": "Treasury Taking a Bath on TARP", "excerpt": "", "content": "Via twitter, via <a href=\"http://twitter.com/RightOrg\">Right Org</a>, comes this <a href=\"http://ethisphere.com/ethisphere-tarp-index-report/\">very cool</a> way of tracking the Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program investments from <a href=\"http://www.ethisphere.com\">Ethisphere</a> -- almost like an S&P index of stocks of publicly traded firms that have received money from TARP:</p><p>\n<blockquote>For the week ended February 13, 2009, the aggregate Ethisphere TARP Index is down a total of $86.5 billion, out of the original investment principal of $195.5 billion for a total balance of $109 billion.

What are they then?</p><p>\nKirstin Brost, spokeswoman for Appropriations Chairman David Obey (D-Wis.), acknowledged that Obey has been meeting with Members to hear their concerns, but she said Obey is maintaining a strict no-earmark policy that will prevent lawmakers from naming any specific project.</blockquote></p><p>\nA few thoughts: When I trained reporters on earmarks last year, one of the questions I was frequently asked went something like this, \"Well, look, my member only got $4 million in earmarks total--it's not a lot of money. Why should I (or my readers) care?\" The reason we should care is that, for many members, earmarks become the main focus of their attention. It's not the $800 billion stimulus (or adding trillions of unpaid-for spending to the deficit) that commands their attention. Instead, they're fixated on the $3 or $4 million they'll bring home to their districts (accompanied with glowing press releases and photo ops with <a href=\"http://pictopia.com/perl/ptp/pom_2626/?ptp_photo_id=2407396\">giant checks</a>...). Even in matters of war and peace, members can be <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-03-22-senate-funding-deadline_N.htm\">counted on</a> to put parochial interests first--to be swayed by the allure of the big check:</p><p>\n<blockquote>To entice support from wavering members, Democratic leaders included in the bill billions of dollars on such unrelated matters as support for spinach growers and peanut storage.</blockquote></p><p>\nSo it's not surprising that leadership would want the ability to include earmarks in the stimulus--that's how Congress works, after all. I suspect that trying to pass a stimulus bill without earmarks would be like trying to start an engine without oil. </p><p>\nThe means of hiding the pork -- the formulas -- can take many forms. Here's one possibility, from some transition rules in the Internal Revenue Code (culled from <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=Texas&url=/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000168----000-notes.html\">here</a>):</p><p>\n<blockquote>(K) A project is described in this subparagraph if\"</p><p>(i) the project involves a joint venture between a utility company and a paper company for a supercalendered paper mill, and at least $50,000,000 was incurred or committed with respect to such project before March 1, 1986, or</p><p>(ii) the project involves a paper mill for the manufacture of newsprint (including a cogeneration facility) is generally based on a written design and feasibility study that was completed on December 15, 1981, and will be placed in service before January 1, 1991, or</p><p>(iii) the project is undertaken by a Maine corporation and involves the modernization of pulp and paper mills in Millinocket and/or East Millinocket, Maine, or</p><p>(iv) the project involves the installation of a paper machine for production of coated publication papers, the modernization of a pulp mill, and the installation of machinery and equipment with respect to related processes, as of December 31, 1985, in excess of $50,000,000 was incurred for the project, as of July 1986, in excess of $150,000,000 was incurred for the project, and the project is located in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, or</p><p>(v) the project involves property of a type described in ADR classes 26.1, 26.2, 25, 00.3 and 00.4 included in a paper plant which will manufacture and distribute tissue, towel or napkin products; is located in Effingham County, Georgia; and is generally based upon a written General Description which was submitted to the Georgia Department of Revenue on or about June 13, 1985. </blockquote></p><p>\nGlenn is alarmed on grounds of fiscal prudence--fair enough.

Consider just one aspect, for which documents are in the public record: Rangel's financial disclosure forms. We took a look at his filings going all the way back to 1978, the first year members were required to disclose information on their personal finances, and found 28 instances in which he failed to report acquiring, owning or disposing of assets. Assets worth between $239,026 and $831,000 appear or disappear with no disclosure of when they were acquired, how long they were held, or when they were sold, as the operative House rules at the time required.</p><p>\nIn September 2008, Rangel announced he was hiring a forensic accountant to review 20 years of his financial records, including his financial disclosure forms and his tax returns. The Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/15/AR2008091501419.html\">has a nice overview</a> of some of the issues raised.</p><p>\nIn his calendar year 2006 filing, for example, Rangel reported 13 investments, mostly in mutual funds, which he valued in a range between $54,013 and $286,000, without indicating when he acquired them. In that same year, a quartet of assets that he reported acquiring in 2004 and worth between $95,004 and $250,000, disappeared from his filing without any indication of whether they were sold or exchanged. </p><p>\nThe count is based solely on what Rangel disclosed in his filings. It does not include obvious omissions--he failed to disclose his book deal with MacMillan, which published his memoir <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Havent-Had-Bad-Day-Since/dp/0312382138/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1233677897&sr=8-1\">And I Haven't Had a Bad Day Since</a> as an arrangement, nor did he disclose as income any advance or royalties he might have received from the book, which was published in April 2007. The count also does not include instances in which Rangel later corrected inaccurate filings, which he did on several occasions. For example, his original financial disclosure form for calendar year 1990, omitted what had been his principal asset through the 1980s and 1990s, an apartment building on W. 174th St. in New York. On May 15, 1991, the same day he filed the disclosure report, he advised the Ethics Committee in a letter accompanying his filing that the property produced a loss. On June 4, 1991, he sent the committee a second letter, stating that the building in fact had produced rental income between $15,001 and $50,000. </p><p>\nBecause we focused on omissions from the filings, we also didn't include as an error the Florida property Rangel disclosed selling twice (in 2006 and in 2007). Also, we looked only at the reporting of assets and not income--rents, interest and dividends--or trips, in which other inaccuracies have been reported.</p><p>\nWe used disclosures from the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/candlook.php?CID=N00000964\">Center for Responsive Politics</a> from 1995 to the present, and from the Law Library of the Library of Congress.</p><p>\nRangel's office did not respond to requests for clarification and additional information on the filings, saying that they would not comment while the ethics investigation was ongoing.

Rangel Center for Public Service at the City College of New York. There followed a series of revelations that he wasn't <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/08312008/news/worldnews/tricky_charlies_carib_hideaway_126882.htm\">properly declaring income</a> on a <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/photos/galleries/news/worldnews/pp_20080831_rangel/photo11.htm\">vacation property</a> he owned in the Dominican Republic; that he benefited from having four rent controlled apartments (one of which he used as an office) in violation of New York City statutes; that he used taxpayer funds to lease an expensive car; that he had all but abandoned a car he owns, a Mercedes, in the House parking garage; that he inappropriately claimed a small tax deduction for having a primary residence in Washington, D.C., (his primary residence is in New York, leaving him ineligible for the D.C. tax break) and he used his campaign committee to funnel $80,000 to his son for performing little or no work on a Web site. The New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/nyregion/25rangel.html\">report</a> that Rangel killed a retroactive tax increase for a big donor to his Center for Public Service is the latest revelation, but it's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/06/nyregion/06rangel.html?_r=1&hp\">one</a> of about a half dozen news organizations (the Washington Post, the <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/09182008/news/regionalnews/big_wheel_benz_the_rules_129646.htm\">New Yor</a>k <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/11232008/news/regionalnews/rangel_double_deal_140307.htm\">Post</a>, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1208/16219.html\">Politico</a>, and <a href=\"http://wcbstv.com/seenon/car.lease.us.2.713776.html\">WCBS-TV</a> being the others) that have been following the story. I would suggest looking at <a href=\"http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/?s=rangel+scandal\">Glenn Reynold's archives</a> to follow the story, but there are so many links that it's hard to keep up with (that's due to the extent of Rangel's troubles, and is not fault of Reynolds). </p><p>\nA few thoughts on the stories we've seen to date: </p><p>\n<b>Federal disclosures,</b> some of which are now easily accessible online so that any member of the public can get to them, have played a role in some of the stories. Information from Rangel's personal financial disclosure forms, for example, featured in the stories about his vacation home (Center for Responsive Politics puts those online in a <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/CIDsummary.php?CID=N00000964&year=2007\">digitized format</a>). CRP also puts up campaign committee expenditures--for both <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenddetail.php?cycle=2006&cmte=C00302588&name=Edisonian+Innovative+Works%2C+LLC\">PACs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/expendetail.php?cid=N00000964&cycle=2006&name=Edisonian%20Innovative%20Works,%20LLC\">congressional campaigns</a>--those payments featured in Politico's story on Rangel using campaign cash to benefit his son's company. Finding information about the rental car (which members can use a portion of their House office expenses to lease) isn't so easy. Some House office expense data is <a href=\"http://www.ntu.org/main/misc.php?MiscID=5\">available online</a> -- National Taxpayers Union puts it out (it's current through 2005). But NTU doesn't provide information on rental car expenses. You can find them buried in <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/statementofdisbu20082unit\">this report</a> -- Rangel's car payments for his DeVille are on page 1087 of the 1188 page black and white PDF.</p><p>\n<b>Shoe leather</b> was important. It's pretty clear from reading that stories that the federal disclosures were just a part of the picture (and in some stories, no part at all). You can't get photos of Rangel lying out on a beach chair in front of his vacation property in the Dominican Republic from schedule III of a financial disclosure form. A lot of news organizations have invested resources to dig into Rangel. Which, given the financial strain the news industry is operating under, makes me wonder...</p><p>\n<b>Why Rangel?</b> And why now? He's a powerful member with ties to two cities with competitive media markets, but that was also true in 2007, 2006 and so on. I'm not complaining--I think every member should be scrutinized in the same way.

The bills reduce or eliminate tariffs on everything from unicycles to storage batteries for hybrid cars, from hair fibers of the rare <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicua\">vicua</a> to chemicals for making rodent poison. Of the named beneficiaries, 65 hired in-house or outside lobbyists that listed specific bills or tariff duty suspensions as issues they sought to influence, an analysis of records from the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), and the Senate Office of Public Records shows.</p><p>\nLike earmarks, tariff suspension bills generally benefit one firm. Unlike earmarks, members request tariff suspensions by introducing bills, which are <a href=\"http://waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=printfriendly&id=6799\">referred to and vetted by</a> the House Ways and Means Committee, and in the Senate, to the Finance Committee. The bills are analyzed by USITC to determine how much money the tariff suspension will cost the Treasury and whether a U.S. manufacturer producing the same good would be harmed by lowering the tariff for a foreign competitor. Bills that pass muster with the committee and USITC are rolled into a single miscellaneous tariff bill. With the waning days of the 110th Congress devoted to the bailout of the financial industry and the three domestic automobile manufacturers, and no single tariff measure introduced in either chamber, it appears unlikely that Congress will enact these measures.</p><p>\nReal Time is releasing a searchable database of the House tariff bills introduced in the 110th Congress--built on DabbleDB--that allows users to search bills by member, beneficiary (called a proponent), with links back to original documents. The database currently can be accessed in three views: a <a href=\"https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/realtime/XqKHOtUa\">Main View</a>, showing bill number, title, sponsor, the name and location of the beneficiary, links to the USITC analysis and, if any, to comments received by Ways and Means. The Main View also shows the how much money USITC believes the bill, if passed, would cost the Treasury in 2009, and information on the beneficiary's lobbyists.</p><p>\nThe <a href=\"https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/realtime/LsFruHMk\">Notes Mode</a> lets users see more detail about the suspension--mostly descriptions of the item or items being imported. The Notes Mode can be used to find that Ford Motor Co. which recently sought a bailout from Congress in order to preserve American manufacturing jobs, requested <a href=\"https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/realtime/LsFruHMk?keyword=Ford+Motor\">tariff suspensions</a> to allow it to import parts specially designed for hybrid cars, including batteries, steering columns, break assemblies, transaxles and converters, all of which were made in Japan.</p><p>\nBecause 421 of the bills are extensions of prior tariff bills passed in the 109th Congress that were due to expire in 2009, the <a href=\"https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/realtime/zFdghRLc\">Prior Suspensions</a> view links current bills with previous sponsors, beneficiaries, and amounts of revenue forgone. The Prior Suspensions view shows that, while members of Congress change, tariff breaks continue. Rep. Steven Buyer, R-Ind., was voted out of office in 2006. Before losing his seat, Buyer sponsored more than 30 tariff suspensions for Dow Chemical and its subsidiaries. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., <a href=\"https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/realtime/zFdghRLc?keyword=steve+buyer\">introduced bills extending</a> those tax breaks.  The Prior Suspension view also shows that tariff suspensions are a bipartisan affair. In his first two years in the Senate, President-elect Barack Obama sponsored seven bills that lowered import duties for NuFarms America Inc., a subsidiary of Australian pesticide manufacturer Nufarrms Ltd., by nearly $1 million in 2009. <a href=\"https://realtime.dabbledb.com/page/realtime/zFdghRLc?keyword=barack+obama\">Extensions</a> of those tax breaks were introduced in the current Congress by Rep. Judy Biggert, a Republican.</p><p>\nBy far, the biggest bill, both in terms of tax revenue forgone and number of supporters both in out of Congress, was the <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h3934/show\">Affordable Footwear Act</a>, introduced by Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., and co-sponsored by 157 other members. The House Ways and Means Committee received  more than 50 letters from companies groups that supported the bill, which, <a href=\"http://www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/other/rel_doc/bill_reports/110c/hr3934.pdf\">according to the U.S. International Trade Commission</a>, would cost the Treasury $810 million in 2009 and $3.7 billion through 2013. Retailers, including Wal-Mart, Target, Rack Room Shoes and Payless, manufacturers ranging from the venerable Brown Shoe to upstarts like Nike, and trade organizations like the National Retail Federation, argued in <a href=\"http://waysandmeans.house.gov/media/pdf/110/HR3934.pdf\">letters</a> supporting the measure that those savings would be passed on to consumers.

Rod Blagojevich engaged in a \"staggering\" conspiracy to sell or trade the Senate seat vacated by President-elect Obama in return for jobs and other personal benefits for himself and his wife, Patti. Blogojevich and Chief of Staff John Harris were arrested this morning. A 76-page FBI affidavit said the 51-year-old Democratic governor was intercepted on court-authorized wiretaps over the last month conspiring to sell or trade the vacant Senate seat. \"I want to make money,\" the affidavit quotes the governor as saying. U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said in a statement this morning that \"the breadth of corruption laid out in these charges is staggering.\" The charges, he said, \"allege that Blagojevich put a for sale sign on the naming of a United States senator.\" A federal official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press that the allegations include that the governor took money from at least one individual in connection with naming a successor to Obama. Blagojevich is also accused of threatening to withhold state money from the Tribune Co. efforts to sell Wrigley Field and the Chicago Cubs unless the Chicago Tribune fired editorial board members who criticized the governor. It's one thing to try to sell a Senate seat, but even the most hardheaded pols know better than to pick a fight with folks who buy ink by the barrel.</blockquote></p><p>\nMy first reaction is that, if the charges are true, Blagojevich got lazy.

Consider just one aspect of the plan:</p><p>\n<blockquote>...the number of GM retailers is expected to decline to 4,700 by 2012. This will occur primarily in metropolitan and suburban areas where GM has too many dealers to serve the market. In the Plan, it is projected these dealers will be reduced by 35%, increasing annual throughput for the remaining outlets to a more competitive level with other high-volume manufacturers. GMs distribution strength in rural areas, which is a significant competitive advantage, will be largely preserved. GM intends to have the right number of brands, sold by the right number of dealers, in the right locations to obtain maximum profitability for GM and the retailer network.<blockquote></p><p>\nThere are currently 6,450 dealerships, so to get to the right number of dealers in the right locations, 1,750 dealerships will have to disappear. Presumably, most of the jobs at those dealerships would disappear with them. Using GM's online <a href=\"http://www.gm.com/vehicles/dealer/\">dealer locator</a>, I made this <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=37.0625,-95.677068&spn=43.037246,79.101563&z=4\">Google map</a> showing GM Dealerships within 10 miles of the Sunlight Foundation. The dozen dealerships (I'm counting the Saturn dealership at the same address as a Buick/Pontiac dealership as a single entity) which all serve the Washington D.C. metro area, are split among multiple congressional districts and a pair of states. Eliminating 35 percent of them leaves you with eight GM dealerships -- who loses out? Do you shut down the Cadillac dealership in Alexandria, Va., or Bethesda, Md? Or do you get rid of both, and sell Cadillacs from the Chevy dealership in Bethesda and the Saturn dealership in Alexandria? And if you're a member of Congress, are you pleased with a restructuring plan that could be eliminating employers in your district that, on average, <a href=\"http://www.nada.org/NR/rdonlyres/0FE75B2C-69F0-4039-89FE-1366B5B86C97/0/NADAData08_no.pdf\">according to the National Auto Dealers Association</a>, have payrolls of $2.59 million? </p><p>\nNADA, by the way, is no shrinking violet when it comes to influence. <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/usearch/searchresults_detailed.php?srch_term=National%20Auto%20Dealers%20Assn&type=O&cnt=474&filter=tm\">According to the Center for Responsive Politics</a>, it was among the top 20 contributors to a whopping 158 members of Congress in the 2008 election cycle.

To take the 35 percent reduction of dealerships in the other fellow's district or state? Or do you proudly point out that you helped save General Motors (assuming, rather optimistically, that the company's restructuring will work precisely as planned) at the expense of a couple of employers who had big payrolls, were big advertisers in the local media, and whose PAC had been, once upon a time, a big contributor to your campaigns?", "date_published": "2008-12-04 23:42:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "financial-bailout-do-interests-of-automakers-and-members-diverg", "tags": "Ad Hoc, Automotive Bailout, Campaign Finance, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Handy Tools, Market Meltdown, National Automotive Dealers Association, Research", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 526, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:28", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2008-11-25 21:02:12", "image": "", "title": "Financial Bailout: Will Geithner Comply with Bloomberg's FOIA Request?", "excerpt": "", "content": "It's old news now: yesterday, President-elect Barack Obama announced he was picking <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/11/25/business/25sorkin.php\">Timothy Geithner</a>, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as his Treasury Secretary. </p><p>\nGeithner's New York Fed, according to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aKr.oY2YKc2g\">Bloomberg.com</a>, has been \"accepting [securities from banks] on behalf of American taxpayers as collateral for $1.5 trillion of loans.

They have also enlisted Livingston's aid in organizing the U.S.-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce, working with the United States on building an oil pipeline, and getting oil companies including BP to invest in the region.And they've paid well for the service: In the past two years alone the country has spent more than $680,000 in fees and expenses to the Livingston Group.</p><p>\nGetting to that data, however, is a time consuming, difficult process. The Foreign Agent Registration Information System, maintained by the Department of Justice, has an <a href=\"http://www.fara.gov/\">online database</a> that provides users with access, through a balky search engine, to filings by foreign agents in a pdf format. Lobbyists for foreign entities\"including foreign governments and government-controlled entities\"must, under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA), disclose their political activities, such as their meetings with U.S. government officials, the matters they discuss with them, and their campaign contributions to political candidates.</p><p>\nSunlight decided to take a <a href=\"http://fara.sunlightlabs.com/\">sampling of those filings</a>\"covering all the lobbying activity disclosed by foreign agents representing 15 countries\"and put it online in a digital format. We're presenting this slice of data in a searchable format, showing the activities of the lobbyists for 15 countries, their contacts with government officials and the $67 million in fees and expenses they've reported. The records collected and presented here show that some issues frequently appear, including trade, human rights and monetary aid; they also show that countries promote author events at the Library of Congress and raise the programming choices of the Public Broadcasting System with members of Congress.</p><p>\n<strong>Top foreign lobbying issues</strong></p><p>\nThe data gives a sense of how lobbying campaigns operate, and how members of Congress respond to them. <a href=\"http://fara.sunlightfoundation.com/legislator/Kyl%2C%20Jon%20%28R-AZ%29/\">Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.</a>, for example, introduced a resolution advocating a free trade agreement between the United States and Taiwan on Mar. 28, 2006, more than a month after his staffer met with lobbyists representing the country. Lobbyists for Taiwan then made contacts with at least 19 other members of Congress in 2006 to discuss the same resolution. In the past three years alone, Taiwan has hired 13 lobbyists and paid more than $7 million in fees and compensation to these firms.</p><p>\nTaiwan had access to some of the most powerful members of Congress including Republican presidential nominee <a href=\"http://fara.sunlightlabs.com/legislator/McCain%2C%20John%20%28R-AZ%29/\">Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.</a><a href=\"http://fara.sunlightlabs.com/legislator/McCain%2C%20John%20%28R-AZ%29/\"> </a>In July 2006, Randy Scheunemann, then with Orion Strategies, met with the Arizona Senator to discuss <a href=\"http://fara.sunlightlabs.com/client/Taiwan/\">Taiwan </a>related issues. Scheunemann has since joined McCain's presidential campaign as a foreign policy adviser. McCain's presidential campaign has been plagued with reports of lobbyists working for foreign governments, including Tom Loeffler. Loeffler served as co-chairman of the McCain campaign while his firm represented the Saudi government; Loeffler had contacted McCain on behalf of his client a few months before joining the campaign. Although, Loeffler resigned from the campaign soon after these reports, Scheunemann continues as McCain's foreign policy adviser. According to FARA reports, lobbyists for these 15 countries contributed $97,000 to McCain from the latter part of 2005 to the end of 2007.</p><p>\nThe staff of <a href=\"http://fara.sunlightlabs.com/legislator/Obama%2C%20Barack%20%28D-IL%29/\">Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill.</a>, the Democratic nominee, has also had contacts with lobbyists who have registered under FARA. One of his staffers met with Lydia Borland of the Livingston Group to discuss the current status of U.S./Azerbaijan relations. There were four other contacts with another member of Obama's staff to discuss the India\"U.S. nuclear agreement. Lobbyists for these countries disclosed giving $11,000 to Obama's campaign on their FARA supplemental forms.</p><p>\nWhile some countries push for a certain legislation to be sponsored or passed, others lobby to dissuade Congress to support a bill or sometimes alter it. For example, when Nancy Pelosi decided to seek a house vote to pass a resolution that would formally label the murder of hundreds of thousands of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century as genocide, Turkey spent almost $600,000 to flood Capitol Hill with lobbyists who sought to block the resolution.</p><p>\nWhile lobbying for federal funding is hardly new to Washington, even for foreign agents, in recent years, FARA filings have shown that some countries, especially Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, are directly referring to military funding in their lobbying disclosures.</p><p>\nLobbyists for <a href=\"http://fara.sunlightfoundation.com/client/Pakistan/\">Pakistan</a> pushed for various bills related to monetary aid to the country in a counter-terrorism bill. They hired Van Scoyoc to lobby on the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act. This bill provides U.S. Agency for International Development support for Pakistan and also promises a long term strategic partnership between the two countries. The bill also authorizes appropriations for security assistance for Pakistan for FY2008 and extends presidential authority to waive foreign assistance restrictions regarding Pakistan for FY2007-FY2008.</p><p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Recent legislation</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong> </strong></p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">While Sunlight's FARA database provides better access to a slice of FARA data, it is incomplete, and the official Web site remains difficult to use.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong> </strong></p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In June, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., along with Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., introduced legislation that aimed at closing a few loopholes in the FARA.

Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., is pilloried. Her Republican opponent, Sen. John Sununu, facing a tough race, did not pay for the ad out of his own campaign funds. Instead, FEC filings show, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ponied up the $750,000 to attack Shaheen.</p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Political nonprofits are playing a bigger role than ever in election 2008, and Real Time (with assistance from <a href=\"http://www.sunlightlabs.org\">Sunlight Labs</a>) is making it easy to find the latest information on ads run by independent groups about federal candidates. We cull the information from the <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ec_table.shtml\">FEC's Electioneering Communication database</a>, which lists all campaign ads that have aired 30 days prior to a primary or 60 days prior to a general election. These reports disclose information on officers of, donors to, and expenditures by these organizations, and must be filed within 24 hours after an ad airs. Real Time has converted this data to an easy to use widget that shows data as it is updated on the FEC site on a daily basis in the run up to the general election in November. Users can also download the data as an Excel spreadsheet.</p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">While Real Time's widget makes it easy to find the forms, the most interesting information is often buried within the (often handwritten) pages.</p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the past month, for example, a little known D.C. nonprofit has spent more than $11.3 million to pay for advertisements praising at least 21 members of Congress. <a href=\"http://www.americasagenda-kidshealth.org/\">America's Agenda: Health Care for Kids Inc.</a>, an advocacy group that backs the expanding of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), paid to air the ads on or around Sept. 12, 2007 in states across the country. America's Agenda got the funds to pay for the ads from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), <a href=\"http://images.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C30001150\">documents filed with the Federal Election Commission reveal.</a></p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://www.phrma.org/\">PhRMA</a>, whose members include most of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the country, is headed by a former member of Congress, Billy Tauzin, R-La.

While they cannot expressly advocate the election or defeat of a particular candidate, they can run ads that criticize or praise candidates for federal office. The Real Time 527 widget makes it easy to get to the records that show who's behind the ads.</p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Unfortunately, the FEC does not require the reports to be electronically filed (as noted, some of them are hand written). To determine which candidate is mentioned or what donors are disclosed on a form, users must follow the link to the filings. Note also that on the FEC disclosure page, many of the filings are amendments. The Real Time 527 widget only captures new filings, not amendments.</p></p><p>\n<script src=\"http://embed.sunlightmediaservices.com/widget/500089342/\"></script>", "date_published": "2008-10-01 19:16:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "whos-paying-for-election-ads-follow-the-527-widget", "tags": "Campaign Finance, Handy Tools", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 438, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:28", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2008-09-30 19:16:12", "image": "", "title": "Fannie Mae handbook: Illegal actions in a gray area?", "excerpt": "", "content": "This is largely gratuitous, but while tooling around <a href=\"http://www.fanniemae.com/\">Fannie Mae's Web site</a>, I came across their <a href=\"http://www.fanniemae.com/aboutfm/pdf/codeofconduct.pdf\">Employee Code of Conduct</a>, revised in 2007.

Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and a key member of the Democratic team negotiating a bailout, disclosed investments are in large mutual funds ranging from Growth Fund for America, Capital Income Builder Fund and a few others managed by the Capital Group worth somewhere between $130,000 and 300,000. (Financial disclosure forms require members to value their assets within broad ranges, hence the high and low figures used throughout this post). In the bailout talks underway, mutual funds may be given the same kind of protection as checking and savings accounts. In addition, Dodd and his wife, Jackie, invested $30,002 to $100,000 with the Fortress Investment Group, a <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/markets/2008/09/25/fortress-suspends-dividend-markets-equity-cx_md_0925markets27.html\">firm</a> that manages private equity funds and hedge funds. Dodd also has assets with Smith Barney IRA, whose parent company is CitiGroup, which stands to <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/innovationNews/idUSTRE48O99E20080925\">gain from a bailout</a> through the sale of as much as $79.4 billion of their troubled assets. Dodd's most recent financial disclosure form is available <a href=\"http://pfds.opensecrets.org/N00000581_2007.pdf\">here</a>.</p><p>\nRanking member Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., is the owner and still chairman of the board of Tuscaloosa Title Insurance, valued at between $1,000,001 and $5 million. Title insurance firms <a href=\"http://www.milliman.com/perspective/articles/collateral-damage-the-subprime-5-1-08.php\">may be facing</a> a slowdown as the housing market cools and the credit crunch makes refinancing more difficult. Shelby disclosed real estate investments in Alabama, including an office building, worth between $501,002 and $1,015,000, while his wife, Lisa Shelby, owned a home in Alabama and a Townhouse in Washington, D.C., each of which are worth more then $1 million. Lisa Shelby also had money invested with Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Indymac Bank worth between $215,003 and $550,000. All three concerns have been pounded in the financial crisis. Citigroup has written off billions in subprime loans, Merrill Lynch was recently acquired by Bank of America, and Indymac was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in July. Shelby's most recent financial disclosure form is available <a href=\"http://pfds.opensecrets.org/N00009920_2007.pdf\">here</a>. </p><p>\nRep. Barney Frank, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, has invested most heavily in a series of Massachusetts state and municipal bonds that funded everything from industrial development and the Massachusetts Turnpike to schools and water projects. However, one of the House Finance Committee chair's two largest investments, worth between $100,001 to $250,000, was in the Calvert Social Investment Fund. A <a href=\"http://www.calvertgroup.com/news_newsArticle.html?article=13674&image=cn.gif&keepleftnav=Calvert+News\">news release</a> on Calvert's home page said the company \"fully supports the essential public mission of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of promoting broader access to home ownership,\" despite that mission having resulted in the near failure of both organizations, averted only by Treasury Department's seizure of the firms. Calvert also <a href=\"http://www.calvertgroup.com/news_newsArticle.html?article=13675&image=cn.gif&keepleftnav=Calvert+News\">released</a> figures on its investments in firms including American International Group, Merrill Lynch and Bank of America. </p><p>\nFrank also disclosed a $15,001 to $50,000 investment in a Citibank Deposit Program. His most recent financial disclosure form is available <a href=\"http://pfds.opensecrets.org/N00000275_2007.pdf\">here</a>.</p><p>\nAt the end of 2007, Linda Bacchus, the wife of Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., held between $212,009 and $696,000 in CitiGroup Capital Market mutual funds; Bachus himself traded shares in companies like Exxon Mobil, Apple, Sony and Research in Motion. Bachus' biggest asset was a property on Rocky Ridge Road in Birmingham, Ala., worth between $100,001 and $250,000. A Google search shows a <a href=\"http://www.1clickgifts.net/gift/al_birmingham_gifts.shtml\">listing for a gift shop</a> at that address. Bachus has a mortgage on the property with Compass Bank; he owes somewhere between $100,001 and $250,000 on the property. Compass Bank has an <a href=\"https://www.compassbank.com/appforms/properties/index.jspa\">online search service</a> to look through the bank's foreclosed properties.

In this post (which took me about five hours longer to put together than I'd anticipated; hint to <a href=\"http://www.sunlightlabs.org\">Labs</a>: we need to design a tool to do this stuff faster), we take a look at the Senate Banking Committee and the House Finance Committee. Specifically, we look at how much of the campaign cash raised by members of those committees has come from the industries at the epicenter of the crisis -- finance, insurance and real estate -- over the course of their careers. </p><p>\nIn other words, how disinterested are particular members of Congress when they approach this issue? When Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., a member of the House Finance Committee and the chair of its subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government Sponsored Enterprises, casts his vote for or against particular provisions of the bailout, or the entire bill, will he have in the back of his mind the 41.6 percent of his career contributors who work for companies that will be affected by his vote? What about Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., ranking member of the House Finance Committee, who over the course of his career has relied on affected industries for 42.2 percent of his campaign cash? Sen. Christopher Dodd, chair of the Senate Banking Committee, and Rep. Barney Frank, his counterpart in the House, have both received more than 30 percent of their campaign donations from finance, insurance and real estate PACs, employees and their family members. Over the course of their careers, they've raised a lot of money from people whose interest now is an a bailout on the most generous terms available for their industry. How will they balance all the competing interests? </p><p>\nWhat follows is my very rudimentary list, starting with President George W.

Biden -- whatever the truth of the allegations and counter-allegations, it appears that at most he asked his brother to call Lotito to see if he could help find something for his son to do other than being a <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/lobbyist.php?year=2008&lname=Biden%2C+Robert+Hunter\">registered lobbyist</a> -- in the original <a href=\"https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=sxEiZam5udb/HIp0qCJVAQ==&system=prod\">complaint</a>, it says that Biden's brother James was the source of this information. </p><p>\nPerhaps the most interesting thing I came across in the documents is the Bidens' claim that they never would have entered the deal -- which involved buying some hedge funds in a partnership with Lotito that was called LBB Holdings USA Inc. -- if they were aware of Lotito's background and the background of the corporate counsel Lotito hired for the venture -- one John Fasciana. At the time that Lotito and the two Bidens hired Fasciana, he was awaiting <a href=\" http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/November06/amatofascianasentencingpr.pdf\">sentencing</a> on a <a href=\"http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/July05/fascianaconvictionpr.pdf\">2005 fraud conviction</a>. All I had to do to find those two DOJ press releases was to google John Fasciana -- didn't the Bidens do any due diligence in this $21 million deal? <a href=\"https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=sxEiZam5udYmNFk0waBfyA==&system=prod\">Apparently not</a>:</p><p>\n<blockquote>Had we known of Fasciana's conviction and prior criminal conduct, we would not have retained Fasciana for any purpose.

Overall, Warner, the former Virginia governor who is seeking the seat now held by retiring Republican Sen.

That figure does not include the money contributed to candidates by political action committees (PACs) associated with or directed by lobbyists. It is based on available records released by the Senate Office of Public Records (SOPR) as of Aug. 8.</p><p>\nThe LD-203s, as the new contribution disclosure forms are called, must be filed twice a year by individual lobbyists, lobbying firms and the PACs that are related to them. Lobbyists have to disclose contributions to members of Congress, expenditures related to events where there are lawmakers were present and expenses related to events where lawmakers are honored. Additionally, all contributions to presidential libraries, including non-cash gifts, must be disclosed. Real Time will release analysis of those categories of giving in the coming weeks.</p><p>\nLobbyists working for the Washington-based law firm Hogan &amp; Hartson LLP have donated more than $10,000 to Warner's campaign, more than from any other firm. Their clients include health care and hospitals, government contractors such as EADS and automobile companies including Ford Motor Co. and General Motors.</p><p>\nOverall, lobbyists working for PMA Group, Patton Boggs and Williams &amp; Jensen, PLLC were the most generous supporters of federal candidates. PMA Group's lobbyists led with more than $232,000 in campaign donations.</p><p>\n<strong>Methodology and issues with the data</strong></p><p>\nThe spread sheet we're releasing today is based on data downloaded from the <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/contributions_download.htm\">SOPR LD-203 page</a>, which was last updated Aug. 8. The spread sheet contains a subset of that data, focusing on contributions made under the Federal Election Campaign Act and directed to a particular candidate's campaign. As noted, this data includes only contributions made by lobbyists to candidates and do not include contributions made to candidates through PACs associated with lobbying firms or with corporations. The numbers also look only at the money spent in campaign donations that are to be reported to the FEC. It doesn't include honorary expenditures or meeting expenses that have to be disclosed under the new rules.</p><p>\nThis is the first time lobbyists have had to file LD-203 reports; it's also the first time that SOPR (and the House Clerk's Office, which has also released the reports) has had to make the information public. The SOPR data system seems to have various teething issues. For one, it is impossible to correctly aggregate numbers, because SOPR's data includes individual contributions multiple times. According to officials working with the Senate disclosure database, this is because no provision was made to identify which forms have been amended or changed after an initial filing. Thus, every time a lobbyist or firm files an amended disclosure, each contribution repeated is reentered into the system. Because some firms and individuals filed multiple disclosures, the raw Senate data ridiculously overstates the amount of contributions. Real Time relied on the most recently filed form from individuals to compile this database, eliminating double and triple counting (and reducing the record set from more than 107,000 to about 14,000 records).</p><p>\nThere are other sources for potential double counting as well. Under HLOGA, a lobbyist who runs a PAC must disclose the PAC's contributions to members of Congress on his own LD-203. Because HLOGA requires PACs that are run by lobbyists to file LD-203s, those same contributions are disclosed a second time.</p><p>\nBesides double counting, there are other problems with the data. As per the rules, lobbyists have to disclose if they are on the board of a PAC; since there is no specific area to disclose this, the information is mostly added in the comments section, making it more difficult to determine that a contribution is from an individual lobbyist or the PAC he's affiliated with.</p><p>\nNames of members of Congress and candidates aren't standardized in the data. In many cases, leadership PACs are listed as the recipient with no indication of which member is benefiting.</p><p>\nThe data also contains obvious errors, including contributions to candidates running as high as $200,000 (individuals can contribute $2,300 to a campaign, PACs $5,000). In preparing this spread sheet, we left out more than 500 records which disclosed individual contributions of more than $2,300, assuming that people filling out the forms made an error.</p><p>\nBoth the Senate and the House make the data available for download. As difficult to work with as the SOPR data was, the House side seems to be even more clunky. Rather than a single file, the House allows users to download each report individually, and assemble the database themselves.</p><p>\nAccording to the officials who manage the database at the Senate, what's available on the site is perhaps only 80 per cent of all the reports, which continue to trickle in, so users will get a full scope of the data only in the next couple of weeks.", "date_published": "2008-08-14 15:22:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "mark-warner-biggest-recipient-of-lobbyist-dough-new-disclosures", "tags": "Campaign Finance, Lobbying", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 212, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:28", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2008-08-12 16:50:12", "image": "", "title": "Tracking Obama's earmarks", "excerpt": "", "content": "Sen.

Neil Abercrombie, D-Hawaii, secured for the <a href=\"http://www.saddleroad.com\">Saddle Road</a> project on Big Island. I sent a query along to Dave Gedeon, the <a href=\"http://www.cflhd.gov/projects/StateProjectDetails.cfm?State=HI&WebProjectUID=10385\">project manager for the Central Federal Lands Highway Division of the Federal Highway Administration</a>, asking how the project was funded--whether these were military, Dept. of Transportation, or state funds, and which agency was managing the project. He was kind enough to respond and clarify:</p><p>\n<blockquote>Initial construction of Saddle Road began with the section that passes through the Department of the Army's Pohakuloa Training Area; funding for this section was provided through military construction appropriations; specifically, the Defense Access Road Program.  Only roads that are determined by the DOA to be important to national defense are eligible for DAR funds.  The first DAR funded construction project began in 2004; a final DAR-funded project will be awarded this fiscal year and be completed in 2009.  The initial emphasis was to reconstruct the DAR-funded section as first priority as the existing Saddle Road passes through the Army base and therefore impacts public and troop safety as well as military training at PTA.</p><p>\nThe Hawaii Department of Transportation has provided funds from several of its own programs for the segments of Saddle Road that are outside of the army base; the majority of the State funds provided to date have been Surface Transportation Program funds.  Construction of the first HDOT-funded project started in 2006 and will be completed this summer.  Another State-funded project is scheduled to start construction in 2009.</p><p>\nThe Central Federal Lands Highway Division is the lead agency for project development and construction contract administration and management.  The project is a cooperative undertaking among our agency, the HI Department of Transportation, and the Department of the Army.</blockquote></p><p>\nI think that's reasonably clear, and explains why the House <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&dbname=cp110&sid=cp11063DnC&refer=&r_n=hr775.110&item=&sel=TOC_194834&\">gives</a> a project description of \"Pohakuloa TA\" [Training Area].", "date_published": "2008-08-05 17:54:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "saddle-road-funding-update", "tags": "Ad Hoc, Earmarks, Rep.

Looks mostly like it concerns omissions from Stevens' personal financial disclosure forms, though the big ticket item is Stevens' help for Veco Corporation allegedly in exchange for gifts. When Sunlight released our <a href=\"http://fortune535.sunlightprojects.org/\">Fortune 535</a> project on the personal financial disclosures, we said, \"...take what follows with a boulder-sized grain of salt: It's all based on information from the seriously flawed disclosure system used by members of Congress.\" </p><p>\nOne question I have: A lot of the alleged malfeasance revolves around a Stevens personal residence, the Girdwood residence or, as Stevens called it, \"the chalet.\" Obviously accepting a gift for the home would have to be reported, but the indictment also seems to be suggesting (I'm not sure it's suggesting this) that these gifts were in fact gifts and couldn't have been loans because:</p><p>\n<blockquote>51. The first page of the 2001 Financial Disclosure Form also contained the following</p><p>question, followed by boxes for \"YES\" and \"NO\":</p><p>\nDid you, your spouse, or dependent child have any reportable liability (more than $10,000) in the reporting period? If yes, Complete and Attach PART VII.</p><p>\nOn the 2001 Financial Disclosure Form, STEVENS checked the \"NO\" box, and did not attach a</p><p>completed Part VII form. </blockquote></p><p>\nAgain, I'm not sure, but from my quick read of the indictment, it appears that the government is suggesting that when Stevens says he has no liabilities of more than $10,000, that means the hundreds of thousands of dollars Stevens is alleged to have received as benefits from VECO couldn't possibly have been loans. But if (and for the record, I doubt this is likely), <strong>if</strong> Stevens was borrowing money, labor and materials to renovate a residence from VECO rather than accepting it as a gift, I'm not sure Stevens would have to report it under current personal financial disclosure rules, which <a href=\"http://ethics.senate.gov/downloads/pdffiles/manual.pdf\">say</a>,</p><p>\n<blockquote>property which is held or maintained solely for recreational or personal purposes does not have to be reported.... (p. 131) </p><p>\nand</p><p>\nMortgages secured by a personal residence (including secondary residences) that are not used for rental purposes do not have to be disclosed. (p. 136)</blockquote> </p><p>\nInterestingly, the same passage goes on to say, \"Personal loans secured by motor vehicles, household furniture, or appliances do not have to be disclosed, as long as the indebtedness does not exceed the purchase price of the item.\" Stevens is accused of having accepted a car swap and household furnishings and not reporting them as gifts. </p><p>\nSuppose there was some understanding Stevens would repay Veco or its CEO, Bill Allen, for the home repairs, the car swap, the furniture and so on -- shouldn't the public know of those potential conflicts of interest? The indictment reminds us, </p><p>\n<blockquote>The primary purpose of the yearly Financial Disclosure Forms is to disclose, monitor and deter conflicts of interest, thereby maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the United States Senate and its Members. Because the yearly Financial Disclosure Forms require public disclosure of financial information by each Member of the United States Senate, such as income, assets, gifts, financial interests, and liabilities, the Forms provide the public at large, including the voters of a particular state, with the information necessary to allow the public to evaluate and consider official conduct by a Member of the United States Senate in light of that Member's private finances.</blockquote></p><p>\nDo the current disclosure requirements adequately \"deter conflicts of interest, thereby maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the United States Senate and its Members,\" if they exempt personal residences, mortgages, car loans and so on from public view? </p><p>\n</p><p>\n", "date_published": "2008-07-29 19:20:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "pro-publica-gets-stevens-indictment-online", "tags": "", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 193, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:29", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2008-07-29 18:32:12", "image": "", "title": "TCS makes Milcon letters available", "excerpt": "", "content": "Last Friday, Taxpayers for Common Sense <a href=\"http://taxpayer.net/resources.php?category=&type=Project&proj_id=1133&action=Headlines%20By%20TCS\">updates</a> us on where the House is on the Appropriations process (a few weeks back the process could best be described as <a href=\"http://taxpayer.net/search_by_category.php?action=view&proj_id=1095&category=Earmarks&type=Project\">\"nyah nyah nyah,\" and \"I'm rubber and you're glue, whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you,\"</a>, to use the parliamentary terms favored by most members of Congress).</p><p>\nIn that update, they posted a link to their <a href=\"http://taxpayer.net/user_uploads/file/Appropriations/fy2009/hmilconva.xls\">downloadable database</a> of earmarks from the House version of the <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h6599/show\">Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill</a>, they've also put the <a href=\"http://taxpayer.net/user_uploads/file/Appropriations/fy2009/RequestLetters/hmilconva/MilConFY2009Certifications.pdf\">request letters</a> online.  </p><p>\n(This is what happens when you go on vacation -- you miss all the good stuff...)", "date_published": "2008-07-29 18:32:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "tcs-makes-milcon-letters-available", "tags": "Ad Hoc, Earmarks, Handy Tools, Research, Taxpayers for Common Sense, downloadable data", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 192, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-03-08 14:24:47", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2008-07-25 15:58:12", "image": "", "title": "Curious Career of McCain Fundraiser", "excerpt": "", "content": "Last week, <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/07/mccain_moneyraiser.php\">Talking Points Memo</a> reported that one of John McCain's top fundraisers, <a href=\"http://www.cassidy.com/bios/biodetail.asp?Id=95&amp;Office=dc\">Juan Carlos Benitez</a>, has direct ties to <a href=\"http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Jack_Abramoff\">Jack Abramoff</a>, and now works with Cassidy &amp; Associates, a Washington, D.C., lobbying firm.

When he lost, he found himself broke and fielding questions from the Federal Election Commission about his campaign finances. He later had to lend his campaign committee $11,100 more to cover refunds to donors who had inadvertently given too much.</p><p>\nIt took him two years to repay his own loans, mostly with small checks from black executives who agreed to help him prepare for another run.</blockquote></p><p>In his first post, Geraghty also <a href=\"http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGU1YzQyODA5MTI3OGQ4YzU4NTc0ZmRkNDhkNzI4MzA=\">quotes </a> a book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Obama-Promise-Power-David-Mendell/dp/0060858214/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1212591817&amp;sr=8-1\">Obama: From Promise to Power</a>, by <em>Chicago Tribune</em> reporter David Mendell, who writes of the couple's finances some time after Obama's 2000 run for Congress: \"He had maxed out his credit card, partly on campaign expenses, and the couple were both repaying student loans from Harvard.\"</p><p>\nFederal Election Commission records seem contradict both the <em>Times</em> story and the book passage.</p><p>\nTake the issue of maxing out the credit card, partly on campaign expenses. Federal election regulations require candidates, when they loan money to their committee, to specify whether the funds are coming from personal sources (defined <a href=\"&lt;br &gt;&lt;/a&gt; http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/janqtr/pdf/11cfr100.33.pdf\">here</a> as being either assets or income) or from a lender, whether it's a financial institution or a friend. The 2000 Obama campaign started receiving letters in July 2001 -- here's <a href=\"http://images.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?_21037243015+0\">one example</a> -- from the FEC asking for clarification on the source of the loans to the campaign. The letter says, in part,</p><p>\n<blockquote>If the candidate borrowed the funds from a lending institution or some other source, please provide the name of the lending institution and the complete terms of the loan.</blockquote></p><p>\nThe <a href=\"http://images.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?_22992694638+0\">amended, year-end disclosure report for 2000</a>, filed on Nov. 22, 2002 notes, as several of the other filings do, that the source of the loans was personal funds--not from a lending institution (a credit card company would certainly count as such). On pages 13 and 14 the disclosure, the reports state that Obama made two, $2,000 loans to his committee, the first on Jan. 25, 2000 and the second on Feb. 22, 2000, both from personal funds, and both to be repaid at a 7 percent interest rate. Page 15 shows a third loan, of $5,500, made on March 21, 2000, also carrying a 7 percent interest rate. Though the notation that the loan is from \"personal funds\" is missing, there's no indication that the $5,500 was charged to a credit card. </p><p>\nThe Obama 2000 committee did have credit cards of its own, the disclosures show, and there were outstanding balances on them, but that wouldn't have had any impact on Obama's credit card bills (and certainly wouldn't max them out). It's certainly possible that Obama ran up credit card debt for personal expenses while running for office. Campaigning cuts into the time candidates would otherwise devote to earning a living, which is one reason why so many of our elected officials come from financially comfortable backgrounds. And it's also possible that Obama charged legitimate campaign expenses to his personal credit card and then failed to get reimbursed from the campaign for the items, though it's not clear why he would do that.</p><p>\nI'll take a look at the repayment of the loans a bit later.", "date_published": "2008-06-20 15:41:12", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "a-little-digging-into-fec-disclosures", "tags": "Ad Hoc, Campaign Finance, Research", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 185, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:29", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2008-06-19 21:38:12", "image": "", "title": "Who's lobbying for Countrywide?", "excerpt": "", "content": "The <a href=\"http://sopr.senate.gov\">Senate Office of Public Records</a> database shows that one of the outside lobbying firms employed by Countrywide is Eris Group, formerly known as <a href=\"http://www.bartlettbendall.com/\">Bartlett, Bendall & Kadesh, LLC</a>.

The bulk of that amount--$3,900--was contributed by Michael Galloway, who happens to have been one of the lobbyists listed on Cassidy's mid-year 2007 disclosure form. I googled Galloway, and found <a href=\"http://www.cassidy.com/press/pressdetail.asp?Id=37\">this old press release</a>:</p><p>\n<blockquote><b>Spring Brings New Growth to Cassidy & Associates</b></p><p>\nWashington, D.C.

Abusive tax shelters are complicated transactions promoted to provide tax benefits unintended by the tax code. They are very different from legitimate tax shelters, such as deducting the interest paid on your home mortgage or Congressionally approved tax deductions for building affordable housing. Some abusive tax shelters involve complicated domestic transactions; others make use of offshore shenanigans. All abusive tax shelters are marked by one characteristic: there is no real economic or business rationale other than tax avoidance. As Judge Learned Hand wrote in Gregory v. Helvering, they are \"entered upon for no other motive but to escape taxation.\"</blockquote></p><p>Four current and former Ernst &amp; Young partners <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Business/IndustryInfo/story?id=3226432&amp;page=1\">have been accused</a> of doing just that.</p><p>\nFollowing the money isn't quite as easy as I'd like, but it's never been easier.

Blackwater was also in the news for other issues, including getting a contract to train military personnel in <st1:country-region w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Sudan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<o:p></o:p></p><p>\nAlberts was uncertain which story prompted Cohen's inquiry.<o:p></o:p></p><p>\nOther members of Congress appear to have been prompted to seek information on Blackwater on behalf of constituents concerned about the company, logs of correspondence between members of Congress and the Defense Department show.</p><p>\nOur Freedom of Information Act requests for the letters themselves are still pending; Cohen's office emailed us a Word document containing the text of his letter.<o:p></o:p></p><p>\n<strong>Three Months Later</strong><o:p></o:p></p><p>\nThe Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) <a href=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/reporting/1.0/uploads/2007/10/dod-cohen-response.pdf\" title=\"dod-cohen-response.pdf\">replied to Cohen's letter</a> on April 24 -- long after the Feb. 5 deadline Cohen set in his letter -- and provided a list of Blackwater contracts, but none of the actual contract documents that Cohen had requested. That list was not comprehensive, but included only contracts administered by the OSD.<o:p></o:p></p><p>\nIn its reply, OSD also informed Cohen that his letter was being treated as a FOIA request, which seems to be the accepted procedure for all requests even from Members of Congress. According to <a href=\"http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_V_1/page3.htm\">these</a> Department of Justice guidelines, if a congressional request for oversight information from does not come from a committee or subcommittee chairman, it is to be treated as a regular FOIA request. As journalists can well attest, that means that very often members' offices need to wait months before receiving any documents.<o:p></o:p></p><p>\nOSD's response to Cohen further suggested that for the actual contract documents, the representative's office would have to send out FOIA requests to agencies within Defense -- the Army, Navy, Air Force, Defense Logistics Agency and the U.S. Special Operations Command, for example -- directly. Alberts told us that Cohen's office is planning on sending out FOIA requests to these departments for further information but has yet to do so.<o:p></o:p></p><p>\nAs for the State Department, Cohen's office has taken no action since sending out its initial request for information on Blackwater.<o:p></o:p></p><p>\nThe limited information that Cohen's office received shows that Blackwater does far more than provide bodyguards in <st1:country-region w:st=\"on\"><st1:place w:st=\"on\">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

Dennis Hastert, to testify in his federal trial.</p><p>\nBut the 13 lawmakers are refusing the subpoena, and the House general counsel sent lawyers for the contractor, Brent R. Wilkes, a letter saying that it was overly broad and \"did not elaborate as to what testimony you seek from each member.\"</p><p>\nWilkes has been indicted on more than 30 counts, including fraud and money laundering, as one of several alleged conspirators who paid more than $2.4 million in bribes to the California Republican. Cunningham is serving an eight-year prison term after pleading guilty to steering millions of dollars in government business to Wilkes and other defense contractors.</p><p>\nIt is unclear what Wilkes's defense team wants from Hastert (R-Ill.) and the other lawmakers. His attorney, Mark J. Geragos, did not respond to repeated requests for comment yesterday.</blockquote></p><p>The article goes on to note \"As required by House rules, the subpoenas were read into the Congressional Record late Monday evening,\" which I think is inaccurate--it's not the text of the subpoena, but rather notification that the member has been served with a subpoena, that <a href=\"http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=House_Rule_VIII_-_Response_to_subpoenas\">House Rules</a> call for.</p><p>\nI ran a quick search on <a href=\"http://www.lousdb.org\">LOUIS</a> in the 2007 Congressional Record for Subpoena, and pulled all the notifications.

But still, somehow unsatisfying. I fooled around with the text file and was able to convert it to a tab delimited form (all those years coding agate at the Philadelphia Inquirer really came in handy).</p><p>\nNow, a few explanations. There are three sheets on the spreadsheet. Sheet one is the cleanest version of the data with some value added fields, sheet two has every field--the enhanced ones and the original ones, and sheet three has only the original fields from the text file. I ended up ignoring some fields (in part because DoD stopped sending them to us in response to subsequent requests, and in part because we've been unable to learn from DoD what those fields mean--the ones I didn't really touch were Agency, Task, Suspense and File Number). There's also a pair of columns called \"Extra One\" and \"Extra Two\" -- some of the data got bumped further to the right, but it was hard to tell which column to assign the extras to.</p><p>\nThere's also some very messy data. For example, there's a lot of garble like this, WOULD LIKE7a REIOhR_REPID_R POSITION IN DOD,</p><p>and this OSD \"j2o5-07. The latter is from the OSD control number field, which one could use in a freedom of information request to more easily get a copy of the actual letter to which it refers. Those numbers are supposed to look like this: OSD 00136-07.</p><p>\nNow, to get this data into better shape, I need to go back to those .tif files, print them all out (there are 189 of them) and painstakingly go through them, comparing each page to the corresponding line in the spread sheet, fixing garble and double checking numbers, names and dates.</p><p>\nNow, the really ridiculous thing about all this is that the Office of the Secretary of Defense keeps its records in a form not dissimilar to the one that we've managed to put together here. To respond to our FOIA request, someone at DoD (probably a contractor) printed pages from a database, which they then turned into .tif files, which they then copied onto a CD-Rom, which they then sent to us.

The Hill <a href=\"http://thehill.com/business--lobby/monopoly-continues-for-pa.-company-says-hatch-2007-06-26.html\">recently noted</a> that Sen. Orrin Hatch characterized the $50 million-plus program as being a monopoly awarded to the incumbent contractor, Mobility Technologies, Inc. Here's what FHWA advises would-be bidders:</p><p><blockquote>Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for copies of Mobility Technologies, Inc.'s INCUMBENT contract document are unlikely to be fruitful for organizations wishing to compete for this FOLLOW-ON project, for the following reasons: (a) the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) routinely REDACTS, from contract documents furnished to FOIA requesters, all pricing data and all staffing data; (b) the Statement of Work that will be published hereafter in the Solicitation (RFP) for this FOLLOW-ON project will be self-contained and will stand alone and will DIFFER in many crucial respects from the Statement of Work set forth in Mobility Technologies Inc.'s INCUMBENT contract document; (c) any attempt, by an offeror submitting a proposal for this follow-on project, to respond to the INCUMBENT contract's Statement of Work would almost certainly call into serious question the offeror's grasp of, and commitment to attaining, the technical objectives of this follow-on project; and (d) given the time-consuming procedure governing the FHWA's processing of FOIA requests, it is unlikely that even an extensively redacted and probably useless copy of Mobility Technologies Inc.'s INCUMBENT contract document could be made available to any FOIA requester before the due date for submitting PROPOSALS under this follow-on procurement.</blockquote></p><p>\nI'd FOIAed that very contract <a href=\"http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/node/2118\">last February</a>, and received a copy of it in June, without any of the redactions described above (a copy is <a href=\"http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/reporting/1.0/uploads/2007/07/mobility-task-order.pdf\" title=\"Incumbent Contract Document\">attached</a>).

He told me it wasn't, and explained that the passage means that companies seeking the follow-on contract shouldn't wait around for their FOIA response to be filled if they want to win this business. \"The technical office wrote that, the program office wrote that just to tell people that the new effort is similar to the one undertaken by Mobility Technologies,\" he said, adding that the contract is \"available if you want it, but I'm not sure it would be helpful. If you wanted to obtain that you certainly could, but it takes time. [The notice is] trying to tell you that you shouldn't wait around.\"</p><p>\nI suggested that some of the language seemed to be a little tougher, particularly the bit saying, \"any attempt, by an offeror submitting a proposal for this follow-on project, to respond to the INCUMBENT contract's Statement of Work would almost certainly call into serious question the offeror's grasp of, and commitment to attaining, the technical objectives of this follow-on project.\"</p><p>\nRobel said that the passage on FOIA had been written by the FHWA <a href=\"http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/\">Office of Operations</a>; I asked him who specifically, and he told me he couldn't tell me.", "date_published": "2007-07-09 21:02:11", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "fhwa-discouraging-foia-requests-from-potential-contractors", "tags": "Earmarks, SF-LLL investigation", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 80, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:30", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2007-06-21 22:15:11", "image": "", "title": "Smart reforms to deter congressional conflicts", "excerpt": "", "content": "I wish I'd notice <a href=\"http://www.taxpayer.net/TCS/PressReleases/2007/06-14disclosures.html\">this</a> earlier: <a href=\"http://www.taxpayer.net\">Taxpayers for Common Sense</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.nlpc.org/\">National Law and Policy Center</a> sent a <a href=\"http://www.nlpc.org/pdfs/Financial_Disclosure_Report_Reforms_6-13_edits.pdf\">joint letter</a> to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, House Minority Leader John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell calling for better personal financial disclosure. </p><p>\nThe whole letter is worth reading -- it serves almost as a primer on recent congressional scandals -- and all the recommendations are excellent, but if I had to pick just one, it would be this one:</p><p>\n<blockquote>2.

Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics led the pack. Those four corporations collected a combined $1.09 billion in earmark awards. Overall, the top 20 corporate recipients of 2005 earmarks were all defense contractors.</p><p>\nThe analysis was based on the database of earmarks from 2005 produced, and posted online, by the federal government's Office of Management and Budget. OMB collected the data from the agencies responsible for dispensing the money. The database does not include the names of members of Congress who asked for specific earmarks to be inserted onto the books, since members were not required to disclose this information.</p><p>\nThe Sunlight Foundation standardized the data, linking subsidiaries to parents. Sunlight Labs developed its <a href=\"http://sunlightlabs.com/ombearmarks/\">own interface</a> for searching and analyzing the improved data, and also offers <a href=\"http://sunlightlabs.com/visualizingearmarks/\">visualizations</a> of the information using <a href=\"http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/app\">Many Eyes</a>, part of IBM's <a href=\"http://domino.watson.ibm.com/cambridge/research.nsf/pages/cue.html?Open\">Collaborative User Experience</a> research group.</p><p>\nOf the $18.9 billion in earmarks that were awarded, just under half -- $9.3 billion -- paid for Defense Department projects. The Department of Transportation was a distant second, with $3.2 billion in earmarks. Most of the transportation earmarks were passed on to state highway departments.</p><p>\nSeven major defense contractors collected over $100 million apiece in the earmarks sweepstakes, in which members of Congress short circuit the federal government's competitive bidding process and award funds directly to firms, specifying the winners in the language of bills, committee or conference reports, letters or other communications sent by members to federal agencies, and even statements made by members on the floor of the House or Senate.</p><p>\nUntil 2007, members could insert earmarks anonymously. In January, the House adopted rules intended to improve public disclosure of earmarks, while the Senate rule to do the same has yet to be passed.

In other cases, earmarks specifying multiple recipients had a dollar amount listed, but the allocation of dollars among each recipient was not. For this analysis, those figures were not included.</p><p>\nAll the top recipients -- and many others further down the list -- helped pave the way for their earmark awards through extensive lobbying efforts and campaign contributions. Each of the big seven is a well-established player in Washington's industry of influence, spending millions a year to lobby on a wide variety of issues ranging from federal tax and trade policy to health care to appropriations. The companies' employees and family members and political action committees donate hundreds of thousands of dollars each election cycle to members of Congress.</p><p>\nIn 2004-the year in which the earmarks in the Office of Management and Budget's database were approved-Boeing reported spending almost $8.7 million lobbying the government. The PAC, employees and their family members of the aerospace giant contributed nearly $1.8 million to political campaigns in the 2004 election cycle. Northrop Grumman reported spending almost $12.6 million on lobbying, and kicked in $2 million to the coffers of federal candidates seeking office in 2004.</p><p>\nBecause lobbying disclosure forms do not require filers to specify how much they spent lobbying on each specific issue, it is impossible to determine how much they spent seeking earmarks.</p><p>\nAll lobbying and campaign contribution amounts are from the Center for Responsible Politics; for a fuller list and more details on the top for profit, nonprofit, university and state recipients of earmarks, download <a href=\"http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/files/Copy%20of%20Top20spreadsheet.xls\">this spreadsheet</a>.</p><p>\n<strong>Reported 2004 Lobbying Expenditures by Top Earmark Recipients</strong></p><p><table></p><p><tr></p><p><td align=\"left\">Boeing Co.</td></p><p><td align=\"right\">$8.7 million</td></p><p></tr></p><p><tr></p><p><td align=\"left\">Northrop Grumman</td></p><p><td align=\"right\">$12.6 million</td></p><p></tr></p><p><tr></p><p><td align=\"left\">Lockheed Martin</td></p><p><td align=\"right\">$8.3 million</td></p><p></tr></p><p><tr></p><p><td align=\"left\">General Dynamics</td></p><p><td align=\"right\">$5.8 million</td></p><p></tr></p><p><tr></p><p><td align=\"left\">Raytheon Co.</td></p><p><td align=\"right\">$5.1 million</td></p><p></tr></p><p><tr></p><p><td align=\"left\">BAE Systems</td></p><p><td align=\"right\">$1.6 million</td></p><p></tr></p><p><tr></p><p><td align=\"left\">L-3 Communications</td></p><p><td align=\"right\">$1.8 million</td></p><p></tr></p><p></table></p><p><code><br /></code></p><p>According to Sunlight's analysis of the earmarks, some $5.6 billion went to for-profit corporations.

In early April (I think--I can't check the date remotely), Anu and I took part in a conference call with some OMB officials that was arranged by some folks at the Heritage Foundation I asked whether OMB's earmark reporting would catch phone marks -- they referred to the Feb. 15 instructions and also seemed fairly confident that agencies would either follow those instructions and not honor phonemarks, or report them along with the other earmarks.

Both companies lobbied Congress and the Coast Guard over the program (see page 19 of <a href=\"http://sopr.senate.gov/cgi-win/opr_gifviewer.exe?/2002/01/000/524/000524304|21\">this form</a> or page 7 of <a href=\"http://sopr.senate.gov/cgi-win/opr_gifviewer.exe?/2002/01/000/516/000516924|9\">this form</a>), specifying Deepwater as a subject of interest.</p><p>\nHere's part of the Coast Guard's reply:</p><p><blockquote>This is in response to your Freedom of Information (FOIA) request dated February 2, 2007, for documents filed by or behalf of Northrop Grumman Corp. or Lockheed Martin Corp. in connection with the contract award number HSCG23-02-C-2DW001 made to Integrated Coast Guard Systems, Duns number 0364758330000.</p><p>\nThe requested is not available because this information was never requested from either company;  therefore, neither Northrop Grumman Corp. or Lockheed Martin Corp, was required to submit the requested form.</blockquote></p><p>Curiouser and curiouser. Here is part of the instructions for filing an SF-LL:</p><p><blockquote>This disclosure form shall be completed by the reporting entity, whether subawardee or prime Federal recipient, at the initiation or receipt of a covered Federal action, or a material change to a previous filing, pursuant to title 31 U.S.C. section 1352. The filing of a form is required for each payment or agreement to make payment to any lobbying entity for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with a covered Federal action.</blockquote></p><p>I'm not sure why an agency would have to \"request\" a form SF-LLL before a company that's lobbying would be obligated under the law to file one. But it would be interesting to find out.</p><p>\nOne other wrinkle: Under 31 U.S.C. section 1352, contractors also have to attest that they have not used any federal funds to lobby in connection with the contract award.

This database is generally used by experts and is not very user-friendly.</p><p>\n<span style=\"color: black\">So far, it's not clear whether the inadvertent publication of individuals' Social Security numbers is limited to the two agencies in Agriculture, or whether the problem extends to other departments and agencies as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p>\nThe government has removed Federal Award IDs from the FAADS database; however, researchers, journalists, news organizations, nonprofits and numerous others with an interest in government programs have been downloading the data for years. The government was alerted to the problem after a citizen discovered the personal information on a Web site maintained by a nonprofit group.</p><p>\n<span style=\"color: black\">Marsha Bergmeier, whose family farm receives loans through a Farm Service Agency program, discovered the problem through a Google search. She came across records for her farm on </span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: \"Times New Roman\"; color: black\"><a href=\"http://fedspending.org/\">FedSpending.org</a></span><span style=\"color: black\">, a user-friendly database of government spending produced by the nonprofit watchdog group OMB Watch that includes data from FAADS. (Full disclosure: OMB Watch is a grantee of the Sunlight Foundation, which provided funding for FedSpending.org.)<o:p></o:p></span></p><p>\n<span style=\"color: black\">On the OMB Watch site, Bergmeier found that personal information, including her farm's tax ID number, was a part of a string of digits under the Federal Award ID column. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p>\n<span style=\"color: black\">Bergmeier alerted OMB Watch and the Department of Agriculture, setting off a series of discussions and email exchanges among the staff of OMB Watch and officials from Agriculture and the Census Bureau, which maintains the FAADS database.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p>\n<span style=\"color: black\">The <em>New York Times </em>is expected to publish a detailed story on this later today.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p>\n<strong><span style=\"color: black\">Thousands of individuals affected<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p><p>\n<span style=\"color: black\">Gary Bass, executive director of OMB Watch, characterized the oversight as deplorable.\" He said that government officials first asked OMB Watch to pull down one recordBergmeier'sand later requested to remove the entire Federal Award ID field, as they suspected there could be more such cases. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p>\n<span style=\"color: black\">Once again, it was Bergmeier who discovered the problem. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p>\n<span style=\"color: black\">As she dug deeper into FAADS data using online searches, she found that there were more than 28,000 cases where people's Social Security numbers were being used as the primary ID for the records. In an email she sent to OMB Watch on April 13, she wrote, I have identified 28,209 records on your Web site that contain Social Security numbers and banking information.\" <o:p></o:p></span></p><p>\n<span style=\"color: black\">Both OMB Watch and Commerce have removed the Federal Award ID field from their Web sites. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p>\n<span style=\"color: black\">But removing the numbers doesn't solve all the problems that publishing the Social Security numbers caused while creating other problems. As Bass noted, the Federal Award ID, which is the unique record identification, is essential for any type of investigator making a Freedom of Information Act requestwhich is much harder for the government to fill without a specific transaction number. While a Census data specialist Mike Mashburn maintained that researchers can still use the information without the Federal Award ID numbers, the data cannot be mined to its fullest without this information. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p>\n<span style=\"color: black\">The best possible solution is for the USDA to quickly re-generate the ID numbers and resolve the problem, and this should technically take an hour,\" Bass said. As of Thursday morning, government officials had yet to determine how they were going to address the problem.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p>\n<span style=\"color: black\">Even with the Federal Award ID removed, there is no way to tell how many people may already have access to the dataincluding thousands of Social Security numbers. Take OMB Watchthey said they have had as many as three million searches of FedSpending.org data since the site was launched in October 2006. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p>\n<span style=\"color: black\">There is no way to say how many people have downloaded it or have copies of it,\" Bass said. In fact, after the Census Bureau redacted the Federal Award IDs on its server earlier this week, OMB Watch did a search on Tuesday and found that the National Archives had FAADS recordsstill showing the IDson their Web site. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p>\n<span style=\"color: black\">Besides government agencies, other private organizations such as Investigative Reporters and Editors also have this data.

Kaiser's excellent <em>Washington Post</em> series, <a href=\"http://blog.washingtonpost.com/citizen-k-street/\">Citizen K Street</a>:</p><p>\n<blockquote>Cassidy helped change Washington by shaping the culture of congressional earmarks that became so important in the last dozen years. Earmarks directly transfer the government's money to particular institutions and interests. He and his original partner helped invent the idea of lobbying for earmarked appropriations -- an idea that made Cassidy rich and fed a system of interdependence between lobbyists and Congress that thrives today.</blockquote></p><p>\nAnd, later in the piece...</p><p>\n<blockquote>Cassidy and his original partner, Kenneth Schlossberg, demonstrated its efficacy by devising ways to win earmarked appropriations from Congress for their clients, originally colleges, universities and medical centers. As Cassidy's clients began to win appropriations of $10 million, $15 million, $20 million and more in the 1980s, new lobbying firms emerged to compete with Cassidy. An increasing number of institutions and local governments looked for help to win earmarks of their own. The lobbying boom had begun.</p><p>\nIt created a new career option for the men and women who had come to Washington to work in the government and could now cash in on their experience. Until the 1980s, the typical career of an aide on Capitol Hill lasted many years, even decades; today the average is probably a few years. \"Going downtown\" -- becoming a lobbyist -- has become a ritual, and not just for staff assistants. Numerous members of the House and Senate who retire or lose reelection bids have become lobbyists as well. More than 200 former members of Congress are registered to lobby their former colleagues. This is a new phenomenon in American history.</blockquote></p><p>\nI think all this is true, and I would guess that the American people as a whole were the last to be let in on the new rules of the game. I can remember, after <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smith_Walker\">Rep. Robert S. Walker</a> retired from Congress in 1997, that my parents and other constituents of his in my hometown of Lancaster, Pa., were surprised that, rather than return to the district, <a href=\"http://www.wexlergroup.com/walker.htm\">he chose to stay in Washington</a> (where he's described as a \"super lobbyist\"). I wonder if, in other districts besides Pennsylvania's 16th, folks wonder why that Congressman who used to begin campaign rallies by talking about how much he loved coming home chose to \"retire\" to Washington, D.C. ...</p><p>\nBut back to earmarks. The Office of Management and Budget <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/earmarks/preview-public-site/agencies742a.html?source=APP\">counted</a> 13,496 earmarks costing more than $19 billion in fiscal year 2005. That's the extent of money directed to specific projects and recipients--whether federal, state or local governments, for profit or nonprofit organizations, public or private universities, <em>by Congress</em>, in appropriations bills, authorization bills, or bill reports. That same year, according to <a href=\"http://www.fedspending.org/fpds/tables.php?tabtype=t1&rowtype=c&subtype=a&sorttype=2005\">FedSpending.org</a>, the government committed some $384.2 billion to contractors alone, plus another $508 billion in grants and other assistance to state and local governments, nonprofits, universities, for profits, and other entities. That's a lot of money, even in Washington--and lobbyists aren't just asking members of Congress for it.  </p><p>\nSome 632 clients hired lobbyists who reported contacts with the Department of Homeland Security in 2006, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/agencysum.asp?txtname=Dept+of+Homeland+Security\">according to the Center for Responsive Politics</a>.

The community and therapeutic riding facility provides a weekly education program to learning disabled students from the counties of Alleghany, Bath, Botetourt, and Rockbridge. It also provides therapeutic riding services to cancer patients referred from the University of Virginia and the Medical College of Virginia. The organization intends to offer similar services to the Rockbridge and Buena Vista School systems. USDA Rural Development, also provided a Community Facilities Direct Loan of $11,500,000 to the Virginia Horse Center Foundation, which was used to purchase the Virginia Horse Center in Rockbridge County, Virginia, from the Virginia Equine Center Foundation. The Virginia Horse Center is a 600-acre facility for horse shows and other livestock events. There are currently eight barns, eighteen show rings and arenas, including a 300' x 150' indoor coliseum.

I'm posting the pre-SF-LLL history now--the events that led Congress to pass and the President to sign a bill requiring those seeking federal contracts or grants to file a disclosure form whenever they pay a lobbyist ito influence members of Congress or the executive branch in obtaining those contracts or grants. So here's a very brief accounting of the relevant events from 1989:</p><p>\n<blockquote><b>June 1989: </b>Context is important. In 1989, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958028-1,00.html\">a scandal</a> unfolded that involved former Reagan Administration officials successfully lobbying the <a href=\"http://www.hud.gov\">Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> to secure HUD funds for their clients (including some big campaign contributors) in exchange for hefty consulting fees (skimmed off the top of those HUD funds). Federal dollars intended to provide affordable housing for low income Americans instead is ending up in the pockets of the likes of <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958215,00.html\">James Watt</a>, the former Interior secretary. Just as Congress was rightly getting into high dudgeon over the ability of lobbyists to earn six figure sums by getting taxpayer money from the executive branch, the Washington Post published a <a href=\"http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/interactives/citizenkstreet/documents/WaPo_Dan_Morgan_89.pdf\">story</a> by reporter Dan Morgan on June 18 that showed that lobbyists were making as much of $50,000 a month per client by getting tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money from the congressional appropriations committees, while also helping to raise campaign contributions for the members of Congress who sat on those committees. As the Washington Post's Robert G. Kaiser <a href=\"http://blog.washingtonpost.com/citizen-k-street/chapters/chapter_10/\">recounts</a> in his excellent online series <a href=\"http://blog.washingtonpost.com/citizen-k-street/\">Citizen K Street</a>, this irritates Sen. Robert Byrd; it appears that, like HUD, the Senate Appropriations Committee (which Byrd chairs) is handing out federal favors to insiders, if I'm reading Kaiser correctly. </p><p>\n<b>July 25, 1989:</b> The Senate Appropriations Committee sends the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act to the full Senate for consideration. Within the bill is something known as the Byrd Amendment--which blocks government contractors and grantees for paying for lobbyists with federal funds and requires greater disclosure from lobbyists seeking to influence members of Congress or executive branch officials when seeking government contracts or grants for their clients. (Thanks to the vagaries of <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov\">Thomas</a>, I can't link directly to the information, but if you search the 101st Congress for H.R. 2788, you can find much of this information for yourself.)</p><p>\n<b>July 26, 1989:</b> The Senate passes the Interior Appropriations bill, with the Byrd Amendment intact. At the time, the Post described it thusly: </p><p>\n<blockquote>The Senate Wednesday passed a Byrd-sponsored amendment that would require persons or organizations receiving federal contracts, grants, loans or guarantees to report to government agencies the names of consultants and lobbyists who help them. Grantees also would have to say how much the consultants were paid, report the source of the funds and describe the activities covered.</p><p>\nCurrent laws require registration by lobbyists who have an interest in pending legislation. Byrd's amendment applies to anyone influencing or attempting to influence congressional staff members or executive branch officials, and would forbid use of federal funds to pay for such activities. The information required under Byrd's legislation would be centrally available to the public and Congress, at the offices of the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House.</blockquote></p><p>\n<b>July 31, 1989:</b> The Washington Post publishes a story, also by Dan Morgan, saying that Byrd has decided to block the earmark tha West Virginia Universtiy sought. </p><p>\n<b>Aug. 20, 1989:</b> The St. Petersburg Times publishes an op-ed by Byrd, discussing his legislation. Byrd writes,</p><p>\n<blockquote>Whether justified or not, the perception is growing that the merit of any project, grant, or contract awarded by the government has fallen into a distant second place to the moxie and clout of lobbyists who help spring the money out of appropriation bills for a fat fee. As the new chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have become concerned not only by the perception, but also by the possibility, that this practice could become widespread.</blockquote></p><p>\n<b>Sept. 13, 1989:</b> The House votes in favor of the Byrd Amendment.</p><p>\n<b>Oct. 3 and 7, 1989:</b> On the first date, the House approves the Interior appropriations bill, on the latter, the Senate does the same. The Byrd Amendment survived the Conference Committee process.</p><p>\n<b>Oct. 23, 1989:</b> President Bush signs the measure into law -- P.L. 101-121, if you're keeping score at home. The Byrd Amendment is Section 319 of the act. (If you're so inclined, you can download Section 319 as a Word Document by clicking <a href=\"http://www.dotdom2.state.pa.us/ECMS/Ecms_File_Cabinet.nsf/$vwFiles/PublicLaw101-121,Section31906212002/$File/Public%20Law%20101%20to%20121,Section%20319.doc\">here</a>.</p><p>\n<b>Dec. 23, 1989:</b> The Byrd Amendment takes effect.

We've gotten acknowledgement letters from within DoD saying that they are short staffed and have a slew of pending FOIA requests. <o:p></o:p></p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">For example, Gwen Smider, a FOIA officer working with the Defense Intelligence Agency, said that we could expect substantial delays.\" She mentioned that their FOIA office has only eight staffers  a combination of government employees and contract workers supplied by Phacil, a defense contractor. Once their office receives a FOIA request, they send it to the specific office that handles the issue, in this case the office that would respond to congressional requests. None of these smaller departments have employees specifically assigned to handle FOIA requests; they have to made do with the personnel they have, who obviously have other responsibilities. <o:p></o:p></p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to Smider, there are 2800 FOIAs pending within the DIA and their office has received about 350 since Oct. 2006.<o:p></o:p></p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I also talked to Brian Kinsey, Senior FOIA Officer at the DIA. According to Kinsey, the department is still answering individual FOIA requests from the 1990s\" and said that most of the delays were because they had fewer staffers working on FOIA since the global war on terrorism requires a lot of personnel.\"</p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">- Anupama Narayanswamy</p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>", "date_published": "2007-03-27 20:50:11", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "dod-denies-our-foia", "tags": "Correspondence Logs", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 6, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:30", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 3, "timestamp": "2007-03-23 18:27:11", "image": "", "title": "My first two weeks...", "excerpt": "", "content": "</p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">My first two weeks working on the real time project has involved sending out FOIA requests to as many as 80 federal agencies. We are asking for logs of correspondence between members of Congress and each agency. Most of them have been via e-mail or online forms and around 25 others via regular mail.<o:p> </o:p></p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since this is going to be a monthly feature, I was hoping that FOIA officers would send us the data at the end of every month, but that seems increasingly unlikely after a few conversations I've had with FOIA officers at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Treasury. But just to make the process easier,  Bill and I are working on some ideas, from a simple mail merge to a more thorough automation process.<o:p> </o:p></p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I've encountered a few hurdles: Some agencies want us to send FOIAs to all their departments while others want just one sent to headquarters. This could be a problem, just increasing the number of FOIAs we have to track.  Electronic FOIA is another problem:  some of the e-mails have been bouncing back or the online forms are not going through  like the one with the Department of Education.<o:p> </o:p></p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I've received e-mails or letters from most of the agencies with the assigned FOIA tracking numbers with a few already asking for an extension. An e-mail from the Army says that they are processing other FOIAs from January so we should expect ours answered only after the 20-day period. <o:p></o:p></p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Considering this response, Bill and I are toying with the idea of sending in FOIA requests to them in advance, and then maybe we'll get responses in time. For instance, if we send out a request end of March asking for correspondences in June 2007, we may actually get them end of June. But that's something I'm almost certain won't go down too well with FOIA officers. <o:p></o:p></p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p>And so the wait begins for the FOIAs to trickle in. <o:p></o:p></p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p> </o:p></p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p> </o:p></p></p><p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p> </o:p></p></p><p>- Anupama Narayanswamy", "date_published": "2007-03-23 18:27:11", "is_favorite": false, "comments_enabled": true, "pullquote": "", "whichsite": "SLRG", "slug": "my-first-two-weeks", "tags": "Correspondence Logs", "is_published": true}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "reporting.post", "fields": {"last_updated": "2010-01-04 12:59:30", "override_byline": "", "show_on_index_pages": true, "author": 2, "timestamp": "2007-03-22 18:39:11", "image": "", "title": "What we're up to", "excerpt": "", "content": "<font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">We're launching a number of real time investigative projects at the <a href=\"http://www.sunlightfoundation.com\">Sunlight  Foundation</a>, and this blog is sort of a diary of the investigations, where you  can follow, day by day, what my colleague, Investigative Writer Anupama  Narayanswamy, and I are up to as we go about our business trying to make  Congress more transparent.</font></p><p>\n<font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Right now, Anupama's main focus (you'll be hearing a lot more about this in the days to come) is  FOIAing all of the roughly 120 federal agencies, requesting correspondence logs from members of Congress for January and February 2007. As they come in, we'll start putting them online in a searchable database, with the name of the member, the date of the letter, its subject, and whether the agency responded. Our intention is to continue FOIAing these records month by month, regularly updating the database. If a member writes to the Justice Department about a U.S. Attorney, or the Defense Department on behalf of a company seeking a contract, a user will be able to find out by searching our database. A side benefit is that we'll also be able to measure the speed with which various agencies respond to FOIA. Hats off, by the way, to the <a href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/\">Commodities Futures Trading Commission</a>, which responded the same day Anu sent out the request (although in a PDF rather than in a more database-friendly format).</font></p><p>\n<font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">We're both going to work on what I'm starting to think of as the mystery of form <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants/sflllin.pdf\">SF-LLL</a>, a federally mandated disclosure that contractors and grantees have to file if they've lobbied the government to get contracts or grants. This may sound a bit arcane--and not just to you; some government officials I've asked about it have reacted by saying, more or less, \"an SF-what-what-what?\" But the form has to be filed \"for each payment or agreement to make payment to any lobbying entity for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with a covered federal action.\" I should add that the covered federal actions are contracts and grants and few other types of federal funding (loans, etc.). So in theory, if you could get all SF-LLLs, you could distinguish between contractors that win federal dollars solely through the merits of their goods and services, and those that attempt to involve political influence in the process. That seems to me to be a not insignificant bit of information.</font></p><p>\n<font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">We've got other things cooking, but that's enough for a first post on our rather unfurnished blog.
